     "abstract": "In this research, graphene oxide (GO) was thermally reduced and chemically bonded on the surface of amino-functionalized sand particles (AFSPs) simultaneously and used as an adsorbent for naphthalene and acenaphthene adsorption from aquatic environments. The produced nanocomposite was characterized by Raman spectroscopy, FESEM, TEM, XRD, BET, and FTIR analysis. The batch experiments were designed using central composite design (CCD) to investigate the impacts of the initial concentration of adsorbates, total dissolved solid (TDS) concentration, contact time, and adsorbent dose on the adsorption process. Analysis of equilibrium results depicted that the experimental data were fitted to the Langmuir, Redlich-Peterson, and Dubinin-Radushkevich models for naphthalene, and Redlich-Peterson and Freundlich models for acenaphthene adsorption. Kinetic studies were conducted, and the results showed that the adsorption of both adsorbates followed the pseudo-second-order and intra-particle diffusion models. The pseudo-second-order rate constant of acenaphthene was lower than that of naphthalene, and the rate constant of the intra-particle diffusion model for acenaphthene was higher than that of naphthalene, which was the result of higher water solubility of naphthalene. The continuous studies were performed to examine the practical use of the adsorbent in the fixed-bed water treatment process. The performance of the minicolumn was assessed by Thomas and Adams-Bohart models. Considering the error functions and comparison between simulated and experimental breakthrough curves, the Thomas model was reported as the best model for predicting experimental data of both adsorbates.",

The solid produced at equilibrium, consisting of ice and entrapped solution or solute crystals, was removed and melted at either 25, or 80\u2009\u00b0C. The resulting liquid was analysed for magnesium content. Microscopy of the solid was also performed. Although the purity of the liquid was not affected by the thawing temperature, solid frozen at \u221226\u2009\u00b0C yielded the best purity when melted, as 40% of the original water could be recovered at a magnesium concentration of 6.6 times less than the initial. This is because during melting, entrapped solution drains from the solid faster than the ice melts, increasing liquid concentration at earlier stages of melting.",

     "abstract": "An integrated hybrid bioreactor (IHB) and integrated suspended bioreactor (ISB) coupling aerobic, anoxic and settling units was evaluated for industrial wastewater treatment with and without the installation of a rectangular hollow engraved submerged Perspex media in the aerobic unit. Bioreactor performance was examined at different overall hydraulic retention times of 36, 12, 7.2, 5.1 and 4 days, respectively. Nitrogen mass balance was analyzed to examine the inhibitory effects of metabolic by-products on nitrification in IHB. Both bioreactors exhibited a short start-up period during acclimatization. Results show a lower effluent COD concentration of 15\u201385\u202fmg/L in IHB and 38.6\u2013124\u202fmg/L in ISB. Effluent ammonia-nitrogen was 0.65\u20133.5\u202fmg/L in IHB and 0.3\u20134.5\u202fmg/L in ISB. Effluent nitrate and nitrite were low in both bioreactors but lower in IHB. Mass balance analysis in IHB indicated that nitrate was the dominant ammonia metabolite and decreased with reducing HRT. Microfauna investigation showed that free swimmers, crawling and attached ciliates were major protozoans in IHB while free swimmers and attached ciliates were dominant protozoans in ISB. Kinetic evaluation demonstrates that microbial growth was higher in IHB. The Y, kd, \u03bcmax and Ks for IHB was 0.1\u202fg VSS/g COD, 0.02 per day, 0.81 per day and 1.26\u202fg/m3 with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.978 while it was 0.118\u202fg VSS/g COD, 0.04 per day, 0.635 per day and 3.93\u202fg/m3 with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.988 in ISB.

The electrochemical procedures were carried out in the presence of Na2SO4 (0.2\u2009mol L\u22121, as electrolyte) with or without NaCl (1\u2009mmol L\u22121) under a current density of 15 or 30\u2009mA cm-2.

Treatment efficiency was monitored by UV\u2013vis spectrophotometry and chemical oxygen demand. Both the Fenton reaction and the electrochemical process conducted under a current density of 30\u2009mA cm-2 in the presence of chloride (1\u2009mmol L\u22121 NaCl) suppressed the organic load (by about 34% and 90%, respectively). The Fenton reaction was less efficient than the electrochemical process, regardless of the concentration of the Fenton reagents. Raw effluent, effluent treated by the Fenton reaction, and effluent treated by the electrochemical process in the presence of chloride showed high ecotoxicity. In the case of the Fenton reaction, ecotoxicity was due to the low amount of remediated pollutants. As for the electrochemical process, ecotoxicity was possibly due to the presence of chlorinated species, which are highly oxidant.",

     "abstract": "Ibuprofen (IBP), a widely used anti-inflammatory drug, has been detected in many rivers and lake waters. This study was aimed to degrade the ibuprofen from synthetic wastewater by using UV-LED/catalytic and UV-LED/oxidants advanced oxidation process. The degradation of IBP was investigated with ultraviolet light emitting diode (UV-LED) irradiation in presence of Titanium dioxide (TiO2), Zinc oxide (ZnO), Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), Potassium peroxomonosulfte (PMS) and Potassium peroxodisulfate (PDS). It was observed that the degradation of IBP was directly influenced by the pH of IBP solution, and higher degradation rate was observed at lower pH values. The study on effect of irradiation time showed that both TiO2 and ZnO can completely degrade the IBP within 90\u2009min, while H2O2, PMS, and PDS degraded 38%, 55%, and 74% IBP respectively. The UV-LED/TiO2 system was found to be the most efficient among all selected systems (UV-LED/ZnO; UV-LED/H2O2; UV-LED/PMS; UV-LED/PDS). The SPME (Solid phase microextraction)/GC\u2013MS was used for the better illustration of Ibuprofen degradation mechanism and to identify generated byproduct in the degradation process.

     "abstract": "Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) was used to treat olive oil mill wastewater (OOMW) by using water in the absence of any additional reagent. The reaction time and the water-sludge (W/S) ratio were varied, over a broad set of values, to study their effect on the hydrochar products.As reaction time and water-sludge ratio increased, the hydrochar yield decreased from 36% to 7%. In addition, HTC upgraded both carbon and energy contents to very high values, 76% and 36\u2009MJ/kg respectively. Hence, the hydrochars products are good candidates for energy generation. Moreover, the hydrochars products were amorphous and had a hydrophobic oleophilic structure. Their quality and energy yield increased with the decrease in water-sludge ratio while reaction time slightly affected the hydrochar properties. Operating the process at the lowest water-sludge ratio and short reaction time leads to hydrochars with the finest characteristics but at the expense of higher cost due to evaporation rate.",

     "abstract": "Microalgae technology is attractive for simultaneously treating wastewater and producing valuable biomass. However, biofuel application demands a very low net-energy input that can hardly be fulfilled. Therefore, exploration of a more direct-use of microalgae biomass and selection of appropriate microalgae species are necessary to fine-tune viable applications. This study assesses performance of sequencing batch membrane photobioreactors (SB-MPBRs) for simultaneously polishing secondary effluent by cultivating Staurastrum sp., a species suitable as aquaculture feed. The effect of feed composition (high and low phosphorous, P) on microalgae growth, membrane fouling propensity, nutrient removal, as well as oxygen enrichment capacity were evaluated. Overall results demonstrate the effectiveness of SB-MPBR to cultivate Staurastrum sp. in secondary effluent by achieving biomass concentration of 0.45 and 0.6\u2009g/L and very low nutrients concentrations in the effluents (\u2248 0, 10 and 2\u2009mg/L, for chemical oxygen demand (COD), TN and TP respectively). The actual biomass productivity of the SM-MPBRS are 40.0 and 30.0\u2009g/(day m3) for the low-P and high-P feeds, corresponding to production costs of 11.3 and 15.1 $/kg biomass, respectively. Low-P feed results in a slightly higher biomass productivity of 33% compare to high-P feed, but slightly higher fouling propensity. The growth in both SB-MPBRS seems to be limited by the inorganic carbon supply. Too-short HRT leads to nutrients accumulation of the nutrients and eventually reduced their removal efficiencies. Overall results show a new cultivation method for aquaculture feed while at the same time polish secondary effluent and enrich its oxygen concentration.",

Water quality parameters such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, total nitrogen failed to establish a clear correlation with THMs yield, which indicated the overriding influence of simultaneous occurring reactions. Among all the parameters chlorine demand appeared to be a better surrogate to predict trihalomethanes formation regardless of water sources.",

A major challenge in the development of forward osmosis process is the lack of a high-efficiency membrane. In this study, a next-generation membrane for FO process was investigated by integrating nanotechnology with membrane science. Incorporation of polyoxometalate based open frameworks (POM-OFs) within the polyamide (PA) active layer of thin film composite (TFC) membrane has generated a new type of thin film nanocomposite (TFN) membrane with significantly enhanced hydrophilicity and permeability properties. The successful incorporation of the POM-OFs in the membranes active layer was investigated through Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) methods. The water flux of POM-OFs modified membrane (TFNw3, containing 500\u2009ppm of POM-OFs) in FO and PRO modes was 29.9 and 41.7 LMH, the value of which was about two times those of TFC membrane.

     "abstract": "The removal of dyes from the water discharged by the dye industries is one of the major concerns of the scientific community. Membrane technology, owing to its numerous advantages, can be useful in mitigating this problem. In this study, zinc oxide nanoparticles-dispersed carboxylated graphene oxide nanosheets (ZnO/cGO nanohybrid) were synthesized, characterized and embedded in hollow fiber membranes (HFMs) to efficiently remove dyes from water. The physiochemical characterization of these membranes was carried out to elucidate the positive effect of ZnO/cGO nanohybrid on surface functionality, hydrophilicity, mechanical strength, thermal stability, surface potential, and surface roughness. The pure water permeability, antifouling property, and rejection of methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RhB) were also measured using these membranes. With 0.5\u2009wt. % ZnO/cGO nanohybrid in HFMs, the pure water permeability was calculated to be 358.5\u2009\u00b1\u200914.9\u2009mL/m2/h/mmHg. Remarkably, flux recovery of 98.5% was measured.

Clearly, this work experimentally showed that the addition of ZnO/cGO nanohybrid in PES HFMs resulted in high water flux, superior antifouling property, and high dye rejection. Thus, the novel ZOGP HFMs are potentially efficacious membranes for dye removal from water.",

The present study investigated the occurrence of pyrethroids in the municipal wastewater of Tabriz, a city in northwestern Iran. The performance of a wastewater treatment plant for the removal of pyrethroids was also investigated. For this purpose, lambda-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, permethrin, and deltamethrin in both the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plant in summer and fall seasons were measured. The toxicity of target pesticides on rainbow trout and Daphnia Magna was also investigated by a new modified index of environmental relevance of pesticides from wastewater treatment plants. The results show that permethrin was the dominant pesticide in the samples in both seasons with the highest detected concentration in the influent wastewater of 1838\u2009ng/L. Furthermore, cypermethrin was among the highly-detected pesticides with concentration as high as 1742\u2009ng/L. It was also found that 77% and 85% of permethrin, as the dominant pesticide, was removed in summer and fall seasons, respectively. Investigation of the risk of pesticides presence in the effluent presents a very high risk to the aquatic environment which was obtained by calculating the proposed index. Although there is a high removal efficiency of pesticides in wastewater treatment plant, higher toxicity and detection frequency of permethrin in the collected samples is the main reason of high risk to the aquatic environment.",

The nanocomposite was characterized using several analytical techniques such as SEM, TEM, FTIR, XRD, EDAX, and BET. The results showed that the synthesized composite has an average diameter of 81\u2009nm. BET surface area of 49.55 and 19.44 m2/g before and after adsorption, respectively, verified that Al+3 was adsorbed by ppy/Fe3O4. The effect of main operating parameters, including pH value, contact time, target pollutant concentration, adsorbent dosage, temperature, and competing ions were examined. Al+3 adsorption was strongly dependent on solution pH, the maximum adsorption of 82% was observed at pH 3. The uptake of Al+3 onto ppy/Fe3O4 was rapid and equilibrium established within 20\u2009min. Adsorbate concentration and adsorbent dosage of 5\u2009\u03bcg/ml and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml resulted in the highest Al+3 adsorption. Furthermore, adsorbent reusability was tested and it was shown that after five times recycling, the removal efficiency was still above 50%. The maximum adsorption efficiency of 100.7\u2009mg/g was achieved in the current study. The presence of Fe+2, Na+, NH4+, and SO4\u22122 did not reduce adsorption efficiency, which is indicative of the high selectivity of the prepared adsorbent. Equilibrium data were in good accordance with the Freundlich model. The obtained results revealed that pseudo second model is the best one because of the greatest R2 value (0.9905) and it suggested that the adsorption mechanism follow chemisorption mechanism. Thermodynamic parameters such as \u0394 G \u00b0 , \u0394 S \u00b0 a n d \u0394 H \u00b0 were estimated for the adsorption study and suggested that the adsorption was exothermic and maximum Al+3 adsorption occurred at 20\u2009\u00b0C.

For the two ions, the presence of hydrocarbonate strongly limits the pH variations by its buffering properties and reduces the rates of Al dissolution by corrosion. Removal of the two cations was then shown to require longer treatment times and larger amounts of dissolved aluminium. Whereas the local pH gradients near the electrode surface with HCO3\u2212 free water was previously shown to allow local formation of stable Zn and Fe hydroxides, which actively contribute to their elimination, the presence of hydrocarbonate nearly suppresses this positive phenomenon, resulting in far less efficient EC treatment. Whereas removal of zinc cations from carbonated water can be considered as their simple adsorption on the Al flocs, Fe2+ ions are oxidized to Fe(OH)3 by air oxidation after their adsorption. Use of an overall adsorption model allowed quantitative comparison of the EC treatments, with very different adsorption parameters for the two metal studied.",

With this aim, experimental tests were applied to a real wastewater treatment plant serving an equivalent population of 730,000.

The removal of metallic ions using liquid membranes is a technology already used in industrial processes, and it can be adapted for the treatment of effluents and for bioremediation. In this context, the production of biosurfactant membranes to substitute the use of synthetic surfactants is a possibility due to the adequacy of liquid membrane use for treating effluents containing toxic metal. This research approaches the economics of Mn(II) removal from contaminated water using liquid membranes of a biosurfactant produced in loco containing D2EHPA, EDTA, H2SO4, and NaCl. Different compositions of emulsion liquid membrane of biosurfactant (ELMB) were tested (n\u2009=\u200935). The optimisation of the ELMB system was obtained using an artificial neural network (ANN) and heuristic optimisation using artificial bee colony optimisation (ABCoptim) that reported good results (R2\u2009=\u20090.76) in the manganese removal simulation.

Other materials are substituted for use as packing materials, e.g. crushed aggregate resulting from the quarrying of massive rocks is considered a potentially suitable material. However, the real impact of this substitution on water treatment efficiency are not mastered because all available works was carried on small scale pilot and only during the first step of colonization. The present work compares the purification efficiencies of two river sands (RS1, RS2) and two crushed aggregates (CA1, CA2) using backed bed bioreactors over a 360-day operating cycle. The total suspended solids (TSS), organic removals and ammonium removals display similar removal rates except for the coarse river sand. The total nitrogen removal is limited for all materials. Statistical analysis indicates that pollutant removals mainly depend on both grain size (effective size: D10) and the size uniformity coefficient (UC). Furthermore, a low D10 and UC also favor the presence of an anoxic environment and may improve denitrification. The crushed aggregate, as a potential substitution for river sands whose deposits are becoming depleted, may provide similar treatment functionality, namely suitable pollutant removals and biomass support.",

Stable nitrogen isotope ratios in pond waters and gas emission measurements showed that the deficit was a result of loss of mainly dinitrogen gas while emissions of nitrous oxide and ammonia were minor. We explored spatial and temporal patterns of nitrogen cycling across the pond system by analysing diversity and function of denitrification (nosZ) and Anammox (hzsA) genes known to be responsible for nitrogen gas emission. The relative gene abundance and activity supported the physicochemical evidence that the budgetary nitrogen deficit was largely due to dinitrogen gas emission. Contrary to expectation, most of the dinitrogen gas emissions appeared to occur after the first facultative pond despite nosZ genes being abundant and active. This suggests that other barriers to effective denitrification existed in the facultative pond. The dominant abundance and activity of hzsA genes in the final maturation pond indicated that dinitrogen gas emissions from this pond were likely associated with the Anammox process.",

Despite the well known advantages of increased capacity, reduced reactor footprint and enhanced nutrient removal, many performance characteristics of granular and floccular sludges have not been directly compared, in particular for sludges generated from treating the same sewage source. In this study we investigated the microstructure, microbial composition, settling and dewatering properties of granular and floccular sludge generated from the same sewage sources. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy analysis indicated that the granular and floccular sludges had a significantly different internal network structure, with flocs being much more open and porous than granules. Sulphur deposits were clearly visible on the surfaces of granules, which was complemented by the enrichment of some sulphur oxidising bacterial species compared to floccular sludge, as assessed by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Dewatering measurements showed, as expected, that the settling velocity of granules was much faster than flocs at solids concentrations below the gel point. At at higher solids concentrations above the gel point, however, both flocs and granules form a similar gelled network structure with no significant difference in dewaterability. We used the dewatering properties in process models to predict the impact of granulation on thickener and filter throughput. Overall, this work highlights the biological, structural and physical differences and similarities between granular and floccular sludges with the outcome being improved settling for granules but no significant difference in downstream dewatering properties that pertain to filtration processes.",

The emerging contaminants were analysed by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS). The applied treatments allowed a contaminant-free permeate to be obtained with the required quality for its reuse. This technique achieved 100% removal of the contaminants without signs of membrane deterioration after running the 72\u2009h test.",

     "abstract": "In this study, working of hybrid anaerobic-aerobic biological treatment technology for real textile wastewater was investigated on the basis of system evaluation and optimization in two phases. In Phase I, system was optimized at laboratory scale on synthetic textile wastewater and later real textile wastewater was treated in Phase II. The study was conducted for 242 days in which industrial discharge coming from textile mill was collected and subjected to laboratory scale hybrid treatment. Activated sludge used in the process was obtained from full scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) plant and adapted to the synthetic and real textile wastewater using anaerobic process. Individual application of anaerobic treatment was found to be insufficient for the removal of COD, TKN and dyes. The proposed combine hybrid anaerobic-aerobic system was found to be effective in reporting removal efficiencies of 99.5% COD, 99.3% TKN, and 78.4% dyes. The anaerobic SBR added value to the hybrid system as it played a key role in improving treatment efficiency in addition to the production of sustainable energy source of biogas. Study shows that aerobic treatment is required to increase the treatment level by providing the final polishing to anaerobically treated effluent in order to reclaim water. The optimum HRT for hybrid anaerobic-aerobic system in treating real textile wastewater was found to be 54\u2009h for maximum COD removal. The implication of this work is the industrial application of hybrid anaerobic-aerobic system for reuse of water in agricultural and industrial sectors.",

Deionized (DI) water was also used as a feed for control. The results indicated that the NF membrane showed good promise in the FOMBR process when used with high molecular weight draw solutions. In comparison to the FO membrane, it showed a significantly higher water flux with only a slightly higher RST. The NF membrane is recommended for further investigation in the FOMBR, provided fouling control is in place.

     "abstract": "Data scarcity can be considered as the main limitation for a more widespread utilization of mathematical models in the design, optimization and control of biological nutrient removal activated sludge systems (BNRAS). High cost and demanding workload related to experimental data and sufficient sampling campaigns make the data collection process an unpleasant necessity for managing stakeholders in modelling projects. Complicated use of online-sensors leading to frequent erroneous readings and dynamic nature of wastewater treatment processes can intensify the data scarcity problems. This paper investigates the influence of data scarcity on the development and calibration of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) models. A straightforward methodology is proposed to address the challenges associated with data quality and quantity problems in modelling of a BNRAS in the largest Italian WWTP located in Castiglione, Italy. The plant operational modes, weather condition and sensor performance during the sampling campaigns were the main sources of the data scarcity. Influent, biokinetic, aeration, hydraulic and transport, clarifier, energy consumption and effluent sub-models were calibrated by use of the proposed extensive step-wise calibration process. The Monte Carlo analysis was performed to quantify the uncertainty of the modelling results. The proposed methodology could be implemented in engineering practice to develop and calibrate the WWTP models while it increases the awareness about modelling robustness and its characterized uncertainty to avoid bad modelling practice.",

     "abstract": "This paper proposes an alternative approach for estimating the Global Velocity Gradient parameter ( G ) through hydrodynamic characteristics using Computational Fluid Dynamics Modeling (CFD). In the design of water and wastewater treatment plants, several hydraulic and geometric parameters are needed to guarantee the efficiency of the treatment processes. Among these parameters, G is estimated using empirical equations or prototypes. The use of empirical equations is a simple and fast way to estimate G but they are often incompatible with the geometry of the unit, leading to a high number of errors. On the other hand, the use of prototypes leads to higher accuracy, but their construction is time consuming and can be very costly. Thus, an in-depth analysis of the basic equations for obtaining G and of CFD modeling aspects can assist in obtaining this parameter without using empirical equations or prototypes. The proposed approach was tested in six flocculation units based on helical geometry (called Helically Coiled Tube Flocculators \u2212HCTFs). As a result, a high correlation between G obtained from prototypes (used as reference) and G obtained from the corresponding CFD modeling results was verified (with a determination coefficient higher than 0.9995), indicating that this approach can be a promising tool for designing new water and wastewater treatment units and the improvement of existing ones.",

Analytical methods were optimized to determine the concentrations of eight selected antibiotics (ABs): penicillin, amoxicillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and clavulanic acid. Samples were prepared through automated solid phase extraction (SPE) before analysis using liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) with positive ion electrospray. Among the eight target compounds tested, recoveries were obtained in the range of 47.5\u201398%. The highest concentration of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin were detected in the HWW at levels of 5.46 \u03bcg/L and 1.99 \u03bcg/L, respectively. In effluents samples collected from both WWTPs, clavulanic acid was the most prominent compound at concentration of 84.74 \u03bcg/L. The highest concentration of erythromycin (7.20 \u03bcg/L) was detected in the influent sample collected from OWWTP. Amoxicillin, penicillin, and erythromycin were below the detection limit (0.1 \u03bcg/L). There was a significant statistical correlation between the concentrations of most of the studied antibiotics. Ciprofloxacin was highly correlated with erythromycin, clavulanic acid, and metronidazole in all influent samples, whereas the concentration of erythromycin was highly correlated with those of amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and penicillin in all effluent samples. No significant difference (P \u2265 0.05) was found between concentrations of the targeted antibiotics in the NWWTP and OWWTP. Generally, both treatment plants showed effective removal rates (99.44%) of penicillin and metronidazole. However, clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin were not removed from the effluent of either plant, even though the effluent passed through the ultrafiltration stage in the new WWTP. The findings reveal that HWW is not the only source of ABs in wastewater but direct disposal onto the sewer system could be the major source.

The structural order and textural properties were examined using XRD, Raman spectroscopy and SEM-EDX. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted, where the influence of operating parameters such as solution pH, contact time, adsorbent dosage, initial MB concentration, and temperature on the sorption capacity were investigated. Compared with pristine PGC, the surfactant modified PGC (S-PGC) exhibited a much higher sorption capacity for MB due to the enhanced electrostatic interaction between the cationic dye and negatively charged S-PGC adsorbent. The adsorption isotherm and kinetics of adsorption were well fitted by the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second order model, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity calculated from Langmuir isotherm was 714 and 769\u2009mg/g for two adsorbents SDBS-PGC-3000 and SDS-PGC-3000, respectively at 25 \u00b0C, suggesting SDS-PGC has a comparatively higher sorption capacity. Further investigation confirmed that the adsorption of MB over S-PGC was spontaneous and endothermic in nature. Successful regeneration of the spent adsorbents with methanol along with its high dye adsorption performance strongly confirms the ability of utilizing S-PGC as a promising and reliable adsorbent for cationic dye removal.",

Furthermore, kinetics, equilibrium isotherms, and column studies were conducted. Modification of the raw chicory waste by CaCl2 increased the cation exchange capacity as well as the Pb2+ and Cd2+ removal efficiency. The maximum adsorption capacities were increased from 103.1 and 53.8\u2009mg\u2009g\u22121 by raw chicory waste to 123.5 and 64.5\u2009mg\u2009g\u22121 by modified chicory waste for Pb2+ and Cd2+, respectively. Exchange of Pb2+ and Cd2+ ions with alkali metals (Na+ and K+) and alkaline earth metals (Ca2+ and Mg2+) onto the waste surface during the removal experiments indicated that the ion exchange could be the dominant mechanism for the removal of Pb2+ and Cd2. In addition, the regeneration of raw and modified chicory waste loaded by Pb2+ and Cd2+ with distilled water was not possible, while eluting the waste using CaCl2, NaCl and HNO3 could effectively recover both metals. It was concluded that the prepared bio ion exchanger from chicory waste could be a promising and low-cost alternative to synthetic resins for the removal of heavy metals from the water and wastewater.",

Anaerobic contact increased anaerobic COD utilization from 17\u201324% to 45\u201353% and improved phosphorus removal from 63 to 93%. The anaerobic contact also decreased effluent solids from 87 to 46\u2009mg/L VSS with preventing the growth of biomass in suspension associated with rapidly-growing organisms. With the application of anaerobic contact, slowly growing organisms dominated the system and solid retention time (SRT) increased from 15 to 32 days. Alerting anaerobic continuous feeding with anaerobic contact worsened settling properties of the granular biomass. However, good-settling granules were obtained after acclimation of the biomass to the new condition. The application of anaerobic contact also affected granules\u2019 size and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content. More compact granules with less net EPS content and lower protein-to-carbohydrate ratio were obtained under increased anaerobic contact condition compared with operating with anaerobic continuous feeding.

The present work demonstrates the usability of coke breeze, a carbon rich by-product of steel industry for successful adsorption of free cyanide from the wastewater. The coke breeze was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Elemental analysis by energy dispersive X-ray clearly showed the presence of elemental nitrogen after adsorption of cyanide. XRD and FTIR analyses confirmed the cyanide adsorption on coke breeze matrix. pHzpc of the adsorbent was found to be 7.4. Maximum Langmuir adsorption capacity of coke breeze for cyanide was 12.3\u2009mg/g at pH 7 and 298\u2009K. Adsorption kinetics revealed that cyanide concentration was reduced rapidly in initial two hours and slowly thereafter. Continuous column experiments were conducted to observe the scalability of the process using real life steel plant wastewater. First principle based pore diffusion model was used to quantify the performance of continuous column experiments and relevant model parameters were estimated. Using these parameters a complete scale up study was undertaken for treatment of actual steel plant wastewater.",

Currently, little information exists on the impact of nitrification treatment on concentrations of TCC, TCC degradation products, and TCS degradation products. Reactors were run using samples collected from a large municipal wastewater treatment plant at two pH ranges (6.5\u20137.5 and 8.5\u20139.5) for 171\u2009h to simulate an extended hydraulic retention time (HRT). TCS was degraded under both pH conditions, with a 28.5% overall reduction in solids samples when the pH range was 6.5\u20137.5 and an overall reduction of 83.2% in solids samples when the pH ranged 8.5\u20139.5. Methyltriclosan (MeTCS) was formed in solids samples during both treatment conditions. MeTCS formed the most rapidly during the first 25\u2009h of treatment at pH 8.5\u20139.5. Levels of 2,4-dichlorophenol, a TCS photolysis product, and TCC did not change over the 171\u2009h treatment period, indicating that nitrification is not an effective treatment for reduction of these compounds. Three TCC dechlorination products and triclosan-O-sulfate were not observed at or above the limit of quantitation in any bioreactor samples.",

When operated as an UASB (10\u2009\u00b0C), similarly poor organics removal was observed for both inocula, which was overcome by membrane integration, producing solids-free permeate and consistently low CODt (34\u201339\u2009mg\u2009L\u22121) and BOD5 (10\u201313\u2009mg\u2009L\u22121), sufficient to meet discharge standards. At an average sewage temperature of 22\u2009\u00b0C, membrane permeabilities in granular (G-AnMBR) and flocculent (F-AnMBR) systems were comparable. However, at lower temperature (10\u2009\u00b0C), significant fouling was observed in F-AnMBR at a flux of 7.5\u2009L\u2009m\u22122\u2009h\u22121. The permeability decline was ascribed to a decreased particle settling velocity which induced washout of smaller particles into the membrane tank, subsequently increasing the colloidal concentration due to the floc erosion induced by gas sparging. This was confirmed by halving UASB upflow velocity in the F-AnMBR, which reduced pCOD and colloidal load by 31\u201336% onto the membrane, permitting comparable permeability to G-AnMBR. The UASB configured AnMBR promoted low solids loading onto the membrane, enabling pseudo dead-end gas sparging to be used which reduced specific energy demand. Analysis of the dead-end filtration cycle attributed the primary resistance (85\u201388%) to the development of a concentrated but less compact cake. Importantly, this study evidences comparable permeabilities in G-AnMBR and F-AnMBR through controlling solids retention, and specifying filtration cycle length to minimise solids deposition, such that low energy membrane operation can be achieved (<0.122\u2009kW\u2009h\u2009m\u22123).",

A sequential two step electrocoagulation (EC) and photocatalytic oxidation treatment is proposed to eliminate the API below its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). This study is prominent due to the treatment of high strength crude drug effluent, with total organic carbon (TOC) of 7395\u2009mg/l, in order to reduce the organic load with complete elimination of pre-existing microbial population. Treatment processes were conducted in batch reactors, in which, EC was carried out by two electrodes viz. Aluminum and Iron. On optimization, at 10\u2009V and 24\u2009V for aluminum and iron electrode, TOC was found to reduce by 14% and 22% respectively. By Fenton\u2019s reaction with iron electrode, 41% TOC removal was observed, with reduction of cefixime to 0.01\u2009mg/l. On step two EC with H2O2, a further 2% TOC removal facilitated in reduction of cefixime to 0.001\u2009mg/l, determined by HPLC-MS (High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry). The sequential EC treated-diluted effluent, subjected to TiO2 and H2O2 assisted photocatalytic oxidation by natural sunlight and UV source, separately, resulted in further TOC reduction of 30% and 33% respectively. EC treatment effectively reduced the API below MIC (6\u2009mg/l), determined by antimicrobial activity and EC-Fenton\u2019s reaction allowed elimination of pre-existing bacteria in effluent, below the lower limit of detection (LOD) i.e., 0.5 colony forming units (CFU)/ml.

To choose the right treatment process, the key criteria should be higher degradation efficiency and minimal energy consumption. Textile effluents are physico-chemical characterized and the operating parameters i.e. the initial pH, the current density, and the electrolysis time, were investigated. Wastewater treatment energy consumption was evaluated for each combined process. The results highlighted high efficiency of electrochemical processes in effective degradation of organic pollutants at the optimum operating conditions. Among the electrochemical advanced oxidation processes tested, sequential EC-EF treatment was being preferred and quite effective since it provided electro generated hydroxyl radical OH especially when using the boron-doped diamond. Thus, removals of 97%, 100% and 100% for, respectively, TOC, turbidity and color removal were achieved by using the EC-EF combined process. Energy consumption values were evaluated for textile dye decolorization as 0.45\u20131.5\u202fkW\u202fh\u202fkg\u22121 of the removed TOC, depending on the applied current density.

     "abstract": "In this study, two parallel aerobic MBRs were operated with different aeration diffusers (coarse-bubble aeration vs. fine-bubble aeration). It was found that fine-bubble aeration would cause serious foaming in the MBR system. The specific filtration resistance (SFR) of non-foaming sludge was similar to that of the sludge suspension in the foaming MBR, but almost 2\u20133 times larger than that of the foaming sludge liquor from the top layer of the foaming MBR. The intermediate pore blocking was the dominant fouling mechanism in batch filtration tests. The filtration performance of the sludge mixtures was governed by the combined effect of several major factors. There were more smaller flocs, less soluble microbial products (SMP) and less bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) in the foaming sludge samples. Interfacial interaction calculation showed that the foaming sludge had a weaker adhesion ability. Comparison of foaming sludge and overflow foaming sludge revealed that the degree of foaming could affect the filtration behavior and physicochemical properties of the foaming sludge. The findings regarding the combined effect of aeration bubble size on foaming and fouling gave some implications for foaming and fouling control. Since fine-bubble aeration was detrimental for foaming control but beneficial for fouling mitigation, the selection of the optimal aeration intensity and diffuser would be a potentially effective strategy for the membrane fouling and foaming control in the MBR system.",

The performance of MMBRs was mainly influenced by the MF orientation and its submerged depth in the reactors, whereas, MF pore sizes had no consequential impact on the performances. Higher rates of biofouling in horizontally positioned 100\u2009\u03bcm MF coincided with the gradual reduction in effluent flux from 1.6 m3/m2\u00b7h to nearly 0.2\u2009m3/m2\u00b7h, relatively lower effluent COD of 50\u2009mg/l (90% removal) and turbidity of 29 NTU (56% reduction).

The results revealed that the addition of dopamine successfully increased the porosity by 300%, hydrophilicity by 180%, and water flux performance by 600% compared to the original membrane. Polymerization of dopamine into the polydopamine layer recovered the loss of rejection due to pore enlargement by dopamine blending from 91 to 93%. In addition, the blended and polymerized membrane successfully recovered up to 92% of pure water flux after backwash, which indicates the superior antifouling performance. It can be concluded that this new technique can be a potential approach to produce membranes for the water treatment process with overall excellent performance.",

     "abstract": "The ability of electrocoagulation (EC) at facilitating salt recovery from brine resultant from reverse osmosis (RO) desalination of coal seam gas (CSG) associated water is described. The aim was to reduce the presence of high concentrations of dissolved silicate which inhibit salt recrystallization by forming precipitates on equipment. The hypothesis was that EC could operate effectively in brine solutions and provide high silicate removal; thus facilitating a zero liquid discharge strategy. A benchtop EC unit equipped with either aluminium, iron or mixed iron-aluminium electrodes was used to treat simulated brine from a high recovery RO process. Up to 98.9% of silica was removed when aluminium or aluminium-iron electrodes were used. Significant reduction in concentrations of alkaline earth ions were also recorded (Ba\u2009>\u2009Sr\u2009>\u2009Ca\u2009>\u2009Mg) especially with iron electrodes. It appeared that silicate removal was via aluminosilicate formation. Hydraulic retention time was a key variable with 20\u2009s recommended on the basis of performance/cost trade-off. Polarity reversal did not substantially change removal performance but impacted power consumption. For iron and iron-aluminium electrodes 1\u2009min polarity reversal was preferred whereas for aluminium electrode 5\u2009min was optimal. However, a thick coating was formed on the electrode surface and this may inhibit performance if longer tests are conducted. All flocs formed settled relatively rapidly (<20\u2009min) which was in a time frame suitable for industrial application.",

Nanocomposite of TiO2@CNTs was prepared by sol-gel of titanium isopropoxide in presence of CNTs as a support and followed by calcination at 500\u2009\u00b0C for 180\u2009min under flowing of N2 gas. In addition, TiO2@CNTs was wrapped by silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) individually and in presence of synthesized cationic surfactant (C10) to produce TiO2@CNTs/AgNPs and TiO2@CNTs/AgNPs/C10, respectively. The resulting nanocomposites and unadorned CNTs were characterized by transmission-electron microscope (TEM), field emission-scanningelectron microscopy (FE-SEM) combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, N2 gas adsorption-desorption at \u2212196\u2009\u00b0C and UV\u2013Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV\u2013vis DRS). The obtained photocatalysts were used to remediate aqueous solutions of methylene blue (MB) dye under visible light irradiation. The results affirmed that the surfactant improved the dispersion and surface interaction of AgNPs over TiO2@CNTs which formed effective photocatalytic sites. The synthesized CNTs enhanced the surface and electronic properties of TiO2 while AgNPs significantly reduced the recombination of electron\u2013hole pairs over TiO2@CNTs/AgNPs/C10. Accordingly, TiO2@CNTs/AgNPs/C10 exhibited the superior photocatalytic degradation of MB dye and high stability as a result of good dispersion of AgNPs by the surfactant, the lower band-gap energy (2.25\u2009eV) and the larger surface area (146 m2/g) than that of TiO2@CNTs/AgNPs.",

Hence, the remediation of landfill leachate is a challenge for environmental scientists and practitioners. Present work aims to study the application of phycoremediation process as tertiary treatment for pre-treated landfill leachate combined with carbon biosequestration in laboratory-scale photobioreactor (PBR) which can be easily scaled-up for on-site application. Real leachate collected from solid waste dumpsite was initially treated with coagulation and air-stripping process. The pre-treated leachate was innoculated with Chlorella pyrenoidosa and subsequently exposed different CO2 concentration to determine the optimum CO2 concentration for maximum biomass productivity. The results of the optimisation study were applied to a laboratory-scale PBR. The pre-treatment process effectively reduced the biologically inhibitive compounds and colour present in the raw landfill leachate which made it suitable for microalgae cultivation. Maximum biomass productivity of C. pyrenoidosa cultivated in pre-treated landfill leachate was observed when exposed to 10% CO2. The phycoremediation process in PBR effectively consumed 91% of DOC, 86% of TN, 90% of NH4-N and 96% of phosphates from pre-treated landfill leachate and also 0.26\u2009g/L/day of CO2 from the air to produce 2.9\u2009g/L of biomass. Results of the study indicated that using phycoremediation for tertiary treatment of landfill leachate can be a sustainable option as residual nutrients were consumed by microalgae for beneficial biomass production and provided superior quality effluent with minimal environmental hazards.",

     "abstract": "Filtration processes constitute the major solution among water treatments, which appear always necessary nowadays to make water suitable for human consumption or domestic uses, due to the gradual deterioration of its quality as a consequence of environmental pollution and industrial processes. In this paper a new type of filtering cartridge is presented, aimed at overcoming the main inconveniences shown by usual commercial cartridges. These drawbacks have been highlighted in a previous experimental work conducted in the Laboratory of Environmental and Maritime Hydraulics (LIDAM) of University of Salerno and aimed at evaluating the head losses produced by the most common filtration cartridges, especially under progressive clog conditions. Head losses, in fact, are particularly undesirable for low-pressure plants, where they can inhibit the normal operation of the installed apparatus. The analysis of the experimental results permitted to reveal several features of the filtration process in commercial cartridges and draw up different remarks, which led, after further laboratory tests here presented, to the design of a new economic, non-toxic, low-resistance and long life-cycle filtration cartridge, proposed and described in this paper. This cartridge, is basically made of a central element in inert cotton wrapped in a cylindrical polypropylene support, similar to the commercial one but with the core protected by elements, such as white marble pebbles, effective microorganism ceramic cylinders and granular active coal, which, while ensuring a good hydraulic permeability, is capable of stopping much of the particles suspended in the fluid before they reach the cartridge causing its clogging. The new design permits, therefore, to significantly reduce, compared with the commercial cartridges, average head losses even for high clogging degrees, and to increase, as a consequence, the life cycle of the cartridges.",

We have compared direct oil-water emulsion treatment using a ceramic microfiltration (MF) membrane with a hybrid system of coagulation/ sand filtration pre-treatment prior to ceramic membrane MF. Superior permeate flux was obtained using the hybrid coagulation/sand filter \u2013MF process due to a reduction of membrane fouling by reducing the oil concentration in the inlet emulsion to the ceramic membrane. Moreover, the oil removal efficiency for hybrid coagulation/sand filter \u2013MF was higher than when using combined sand filter/MF, direct ceramic membrane MF and sand filtration alone.",

The PAN ultrafiltration (UF) membrane was produced using the phase inversion method and used in a dead-end cell system. The morphology and physiochemical properties of the prepared membrane were characterized using SEM, EDX, XRD, FTIR, and AFM. Parameters, including surfactant concentration, solution pH, and transmembrane pressure (TMP) were examined to determine their effects on the permeate flux and removal efficiency of As(V) and NO3\u2013, besides CPC rejection. Increasing CPC concentration from 0.1 to 5\u2009mM, removal of As(V) and NO3\u2013 increased from 49.3% to 96.9% and from 0.3% to 90.5%, and the permeate flux reduced from 36.6 to 10.2\u2009L/m2/h and from 54.2 to 33.3\u2009L/m2/h, respectively. In addition, simultaneous removal of As(V) and NO3\u2013 via MEUF was studied, which showed that removal of NO3\u2013 was majorly prevented by As(V) because of competitive binding of CPC micelles between NO3\u2013 and As(V); however, As(V) removal was only slightly inhibited by NO3\u2013.

To address this major drawback, membrane modification has been widely studied to increase the membrane resistance to fouling. This paper studies the effect of using chitosan solution to modify ultrafiltration PAN and PVDF membranes and evaluate their filtration of humic acid (HA) solution and their fouling resistance capabilities. Two modification methods were evaluated, namely immersion and flow through methods. The hydrophilicity of both membranes was significantly improved due attachment of hydrophilic chitosan particles on the surface of the membrane. The flow through modification method enables deposition of chitosan particles inside the membrane pores enhancing the hydrophilicity of the membrane compared with the immersion method. The deposition of chitosan on both membranes reduced their water permeability. However, both modified membranes exhibited enhanced fouling resistance property. Furthermore, their rejection of HA was improved, particularly with PVDF membranes.",

The nanoparticulate at five different concentrations were added into the polymeric dope solutions including 15 or 18\u2009wt% of PES, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as solvents, and 1\u2009wt% of pore forming agent. These nanoparticulate may improve porosity, hydrophilicity, and open the channels up for improved water transport. Although many nanoparticulate with various properties and functionalities have been used for the same aims, the efforts have been made to choose the best nanomaterial and its loading among these five famous nanofillers for modifying PES ultrafiltration membrane. The nanocomposite membranes showed better antifouling characteristics and water permeability as compared with the pristine PES membrane because of the porosity and hydrophilicity improvements. However, further increasing nanoparticulate loading led to a possible agglomeration and diminished the water flux and fouling resistance. The effect of polymer concentration and solvent showed that membranes fabricated using 15\u2009wt% of PES concentration possessed greater fouling resistance and water flux compared to those of fabricated using 18\u2009wt% of PES concentration. Also, membranes fabricated using DMAc exhibited a more porous structure with considerably greater water flux as compared with those of fabricated using NMP as the solvent. Based on the results, 1\u2009wt% of TiO2 is recommended as the best nanoparticulate for the PES ultrafiltration membrane modification since it exhibited the superlative performance with a 320% water flux enhancement, nearly 98% BSA rejection, and 130% FRR improvement.",

The hypothesis was that computational modelling could accelerate the selection of appropriate ion exchange desalination strategies. Hence, we applied AqMB water process engineering software to predict which combination of weak acid cation (WAC), strong acid cation (SAC), weak base anion (WBA) and strong base anion (SBA) resins were most appropriate. Simulation results revealed that both SAC/WBA and SAC/SBA resin combinations were unable to meet water beneficial reuse standards for conductivity (< 950 \u03bcS/cm) due to the presence of bicarbonate species (4973 and 1918 \u03bcS/cm, respectively). Thus, a degasser unit was necessary to remove the large concentrations (ca. 1328\u2009mg/L) of dissolved carbon dioxide formed due to decomposition of bicarbonate/carbonate species under acidic conditions in the cation resin stages. pH adjustment of effluent from the preferred SBA resin with acid not only did not meet solution conductivity guidelines but also raised the concentration of chloride or sulphate ions to levels, which may be detrimental for crop growth. Addition of a WAC resin allowed production of high quality water (either SAC/SBA/WAC or WAC/SAC/SBA combinations). To comply with sodium adsorption ratio requirements for irrigating soil it was suggested to apply micronized gypsum to the treated water. Economic evaluation suggested the treated water cost was A$1003 (WAC/SAC/SBA) to A$1276 (SAC/SBA/WAC) per ML treated which was comparable to estimated costs for a reverse osmosis desalination system.",

     "abstract": "The scarcity of water is an increasingly alarming issue all over the world, and each sector of society must take action to reduce water use in its activities. In chemical and petrochemical industries, water is a fundamental resource for the production process. This industrial sector has a demand for great quantities of water with specified qualities for each process. As the water runs through the industrial processes, it incorporates several substances and its characteristics modify. It becomes an effluent that must be treated so as to accommodate the emission standards established in the regulations. In most cases, the standards for disposal are less restrictive than the quality standards for industrial reuse of this effluent. If it is not considered for reuse, all related activities will be compromised. This work presents a case study of a Brazilian petrochemical industry where various aqueous streams were characterized to evaluate the quality requirements necessary for water reuse in the production process. The work examines water use and the quality of each aqueous stream, characterizing them with respect to alkalinity, chlorides, electrical conductivity, chemical oxygen demand, total hardness, iron, pH, silica, total solids, sulfates, and turbidity. The study demonstrates that the cooling water stream has elevated concentrations for these parameters and thus demands less quality for water reuse. In general, demineralized water presents the lowest concentrations for the parameters under evaluation and therefore requires greater quality for water reuse.",

As part of the study, the adsorption isotherms, interference of coexisting ions, stability of adsorbents and recovery of arsenic(V) were examined. The adsorbent containing zirconium oxide reveals a quite fast adsorption; through which 92% of the arsenic(V) was removed within 5\u2009min. The both adsorbents containing zirconium oxide and titanium oxide reveal good stability and removal performance at neutral pH. The both adsorbents were arsenic(V) selective in presence of coexisting anions; however, the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide exhibits higher selectivity for arsenic(V) in presence of cations. The adsorption capacities were found to be 1.2\u202fmmol\u2009g\u22121 (305\u2009mg\u2009g\u22121) for zirconium oxide and 0.5\u2009mmol\u2009g\u22121 (125\u2009mg\u2009g\u22121) for titanium oxide, and finally 0.52\u2009mmol\u2009g\u22121 (129\u2009mg\u2009g\u22121) for zirconium oxide in case of tube-coating. The test results indicate that, although the both adsorbents are suitable for arsenic(V) removal, the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide has superior properties owing to its rapid adsorption, higher capacity and selectivity. Additionally, it is demonstrated that coating alumina tubes with adsorbents could serve as an alternative method for arsenic(V) removal.",

     "abstract": "It is well known that natural organic matter (NOM) is the major precursor of disinfection by-products (DBPs) when inadequately removed NOM reacts with the disinfectant during chlorination and chloramination. Special interest in the DBP precursors is justified as it is essential to understand the reactivity and character of the precursors responsible for the formation of DBPs. This is vital in order to develop processes that will enhance precursor removal during drinking water treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the characteristics of NOM within an oligotrophic water source on the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) during drinking water treatment at Rand Water. Specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) and molecular size distribution (MSD) were the main NOM characterisation techniques utilised during this study. The MSD was investigated by making use of high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). The MSD results showed a significant correlation between the high-molecular-weight (HMW) fraction of NOM and TTHM formation, specifically during the summer months. The positive correlation existing between SUVA and full scale NOM removal indicates that SUVA can be used to indicate NOM treatability during water treatment. A link between chloroform formation and the HMW fraction of NOM was also observed; however, the formation of bromodichloromethane (BDCM) was not due to the HWM fraction, as indicated by a weak regression coefficient. The results displayed are an indication that the aromatic fraction of NOM was the main precursor to TTHM formation, more prominently during summer.",

The time\u2013concentration profiles of the recovery of organic matter, phosphate and nitrate were studied in synthetic feed water that contained single adsorbate of interest. Both the single and binary component equilibrium isotherm parameters were derived to explicate and quantify the impact of the presence of each constituent of the nutrient rich wastewater on the process of resource recovery. The time-concentration profiles of all the recovery processes showed that the process of nitrate recovery is the rate limiting step in the use of CGS as the reactive material. The pseudo second order kinetic equation gave the best description of both the nutrient and organic matter recovery but the processes were described by different equilibrium isotherm equations. The determination of the efficiency of interference on nutrient recovery showed that nitrate and organic matter exhibited minimal influence on phosphate recovery but the presence of phosphate and organic matter significantly impacted nitrate recovery. The recovery of organic matter was not vitiated by the presence of either phosphate or nitrate. The real life implications of the findings from this study showed that the use of CGS as a reactive material in resource recovery from a nutrient-rich wastewater would provide a double-pronged approach for resource recovery and appreciable treatment of wastewater for reuse.",

Results obtained show that CBZ can be degraded by direct photolysis but that the effectiveness is very low, with a quantum yield near zero. CBZ can be effectively degraded by UV/H2O2 and UV/S2O82- systems, with percentages close to 100%. CBZ degradation was 1.26- to 2.0-fold faster with SO4- radicals than with HO radicals. In contrast, CBZ degradation was 1.1- to 1.7-fold more effective with the Fe2+/H2O2versus Fe2+/S2O82- system when the Fenton process was applied. CBZ removal from water was most effective with UV/Fe2+/H2O2 and UV/Fe2+/S2O82\u2212 systems, attributable to the additional generation of HO radicals resulting from the reduction in Fe3+. A slight decrease in percentage degradation was observed with all systems when wastewater was the aqueous matrix, mainly due to the presence of organic and inorganic species that may act as radical scavengers (Cl-, NO2-, NO3- and SO42\u2212). Finally, the highest percentage mineralization was obtained with the UV/Fe2+/H2O2 system in deionized water.",

One of the major contributors to biofouling is the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by bacteria, especially the polysaccharides that form a large part of EPS. This study investigated experimentally the inhibition of polysaccharide fouling by sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in RO and FO using two model polysaccharides, alginate and xanthan. It was hypothesized that NO released from SNP would act as a free radical to decompose polysaccharides and in turn alleviate fouling in membrane separation. Potassium ferricyanide (KFCN), having a similar structure as SNP, was used as a comparison. The results showed that SNP could alleviate polysaccharide fouling and its efficiency was greater than KFCN in reducing polysaccharide fouling of RO, likely due to the NO radical released. The presence of Ca2+ ions in feedwater increased the extent of fouling by both alginate and xanthan, but SNP was able to alleviate the fouling. Alleviation of polysaccharide fouling in FO was better than in RO under comparable operating conditions. SNP could be considered as a polysaccharide fouling alleviating agent.",

Various parameters such as the concentration of the doping agent, and calcination temperature were studied. The TiO2 nanocrystal doped with Al was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The photocatalytic performance of Al-doped nanoparticle was quantified by the degradation of methylene blue (MB) solution under a visible light irradiation condition. Its performance was compared against undoped-nano-TiO2. The results showed that Al(NO3)3 solution with a concentration of 0.25% and volume of 100\u2009cm/ml, and calcined at 300 \u0e50C for 4\u2009h, was the optimum condition of Al-doped nano-TiO2.

With respect to nutrient parameters, nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates were significantly deteriorated with increasing aeration off times. A statistical comparison of different operational phases, using analysis of variance and Turkey Post Hoc test, was also done to check the similarity/dissimilarity of applied strategies.

The aim of this work is to evaluate and compare the performance of ferrous and aluminium sulfate coagulations and to compare between sand filter, coagulation and a hybrid coagulation/sand filter process when used as pre-treatment options. When the concentration of oil was low in the oil-water emulsion, the treatment by sand filter alone was adequate (oil \u226450\u2009mg/L).

The optimal technology for pre-treatment to remove oil from oil-water emulsion was found to be a coagulant dosage of aluminium sulfate combined with sand filter at pH 8 during various concentrations as hybrid. Optimal conditions were found to occur at mixing duration and speed of 120\u2009s and 250\u2009rpm respectively.",

The hypothesis was that Bayer precipitates could not only economically treat a wide range of AMD compositions but also do this in an environmentally acceptable manner. Therefore, the aim was to synthesise a range of Bayer precipitates and test their remediation effectiveness with a variety of real AMD samples. Thermal activation of Bayer precipitate at 380 \u00b0C produced a material which required the least mass to neutralize AMD and removed greater amounts of problematic species such as manganese (e.g. 74 to 82.8% reduction for Bayer precipitate and 83.7 to 91.6% reduction for thermally activated Bayer precipitate). The presence of an amorphous mixed magnesium/aluminium oxide and lack of carbonate species in the thermally activated Bayer precipitate was proposed to explain the improved performance. The resultant sludge was composed of hydrotalcite and possibly calcium sulphate and calcium carbonate, with precise quantities dependent upon the AMD tested. Exposure of sludge to water promoted the dissolution of a fraction of the hydrotalcite which enhanced concentrations of Mg and Ca in solution; albeit, contact of the sludge with AMD resulted in further removal of dissolved metals and raised the pH of the AMD. In summary, this study has developed a new process using two industrial waste products to solve a critical environmental problem. Future research should investigate the commercial feasibility.",

Granules were cultivated within 9 days of operation of the sequencing batch reactor (SBR), with SVI30 of 51.6\u2009mL/g, achieving steady-state within the first three weeks of operation. On average, COD removal efficiency was 90%. Granules cultivated from the SBR were transferred into a batch system with real pulp mill effluent. Tannin/lignin removal efficiency was 97% at an initial concentration of 50\u2009mg/L, and slowly decreased to about 60% when the influent concentration increased to 100\u2009mg/L. The most prominent species responsible for the degradation of these toxic substances were Pseudomonas, Corynebacteriaceae and Flavobacterium. These key findings demonstrate the capability of AGS to provide adequate treatment for PPW.",

Bacteria inactivation was conducted in batch reactors at varied disinfectant concentrations, pH, temperature and initial bacteria densities in buffered disinfectant demand free water. The bactericidal mechanism in terms of the effect on the permeability of the outer and cytoplasmic cell membranes and the morphology of the cells were explored. At the highest studied concentration (5.0\u2009mg/L), at least 5-log reductions in bacterial population were observed for each strain of bacteria. Chlorine dioxide inactivation showed a stronger sensitivity to changes in water pH conditions with the inactivation rate at 8.5 being at least 4-fold of what pertained at 6.5 but efficiency was less impacted by changes in the initial bacteria density. A rise in temperature from 4\u2009\u00b0C to 15\u2009\u00b0C resulted in approximately 56% increase in the inactivation rate of S. aureus. Chlorine dioxide was found to increase the permeability of outer and cytoplasmic cell membranes and consequently resulting in the release of vital nuclear materials which strongly correlated with loss of cell activity or death. However, from TEM micrographs significant morphological damages or cells lysis was not observed. These results provide vital data on operational strategies to enhance efficient disinfection of water with chlorine dioxide whilst monitoring regulatory requirements on disinfection by-products.",

     "abstract": "Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are now widely implemented in wastewater treatment plants due to their compact design and high effluent water quality. However, membrane biofouling has significant impact on MBR performance and energy cost. Quorum sensing inhibiting (QSI) compounds have the ability to disrupt bacterial communication pathways that lead to biofilm formation and biofouling. In this study, an anti-biofouling membrane was developed by incorporating vanillin, a known QSI molecule onto the surface of a commercial chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) microfiltration membrane by Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The CPE membrane was reacted with the vanillin in a solvent mixture containing potassium carbonate and N, N-dimethylformamide for vanillin incorporation. The solvent mixture without vanillin was also used to create a control membrane to understand the QSI anti-biofouling capabilities. Raman and FTIR spectroscopy indicated that vanillin was retained on the modified membrane surface under cross-flow condition and sodium hypochlorite cleaning. The modified membrane had significantly less biofouling compared to the unmodified and control membranes tested using activated sludge collected from wastewater treatment plants. The control membrane experienced up to a 52% reduction in live cells, dead cells, and polysaccharides in the fouling layer compared to unmodified membrane. The incorporation of vanillin further decreased the amount of live cells, dead cells, and polysaccharides covering the surface by 82%, 77%, and 51%, respectively, compared to the unmodified membrane. This research showed that vanillin-modified membranes have potential to improve the membrane anti-biofouling capabilities and MBR performance.",

     "abstract": "Hydrogels are widely used as a coagulant in water treatment in addition to using in tissue engineering due to their high water absorption capacity and biocompatibility. Our research objective is to synthesize a reinforced membrane made using hydrogels targeted for the separation of water from oil-water mixtures. The reinforced hydrogel is synthesized by graft polymerization of water-soluble polymer such as polyacrylamide (PAM) homo-polymer and poly (Na-Ac/AM) copolymer reinforcing on a thin-fine metallic mesh. Different factors such as the mesh size, the percentage of coated-hydrogel, swelling index are varied to study their effect on the separation efficiency. The morphology of the reinforced hydrogel was analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy. In the case of hydrogels made from copolymers, the effect of the corresponding concentration of the copolymer on the separation efficiency is studied. Oil-water mixtures of 5/95 and 10/90 oil/water % were chosen based on typical compostion found in industrial wastewater. The wettability of water and oil on the PAM- hydrogel coated mesh was evaluated using the contact angle measurements obtained at ambient temperature. It was found that PAM polymer and Na-Ac/AM copolymer hydrogel coated meshes are super-hydrophilic in an air-solid-liquid three phases with both contact angles in oil and water less than 15\u00b0. Underwater contact angles for the four different sizes of meshes based on PAM coated mesh are observed to be greater than 90\u00b0. This indicates the oleophobic properties of the coated mesh under the water and oil cannot penetrate through the coated mesh while the water alone is absorbed through it. The difference in the water flow or separation time becomes smaller with increasing the mesh\u2019s pore size up to 80\u2009\u03bcm, while separation time was higher for 200\u2009\u03bcm mesh as more hydrogel was blocking the pores. In contrast, the separation time is faster with the copolymer due to the higher swelling capacity of the copolymer. Therefore, under-water oleo-phobic properties of the PAM coated meshes make it a promising candidate for separation of oil/water emulsions with more than 95% separation efficiency.",

Cationic cellulose derivatives were synthesized using both conventional and novel methods from several commercially available cellulose pulps. The cationic derivatives were used as biobased flocculants to treat real-life wastewater samples in a head-to-head comparison with cationic polyacrylamides. A novel high-consistency, high shear mixing heterogeneous mixing method enables the preparation of cellulose derivatives without the use of solvent or high cost solubilization methods. When higher cationic charge is required, deep eutectic solvents can be used to modify cellulose. Both the molecular weight and charge of the cationic cellulose derivatives have a drastic influence on performance in water treatment applications. Flocculation experiments with real-life waste water samples revealed that cationic cellulose derivatives are able to effectively function as flocculants and fixatives, and even outperform commercial polyacrylamides.

In this experimental study, a FGD wastewater was evaporated using the exhausted heat from the flue gas in a 330\u2009MW coal-fired power plant. The numerical simulation and engineering practice results were compared, and the key operating parameters were obtained, such as boiler load conditions, the ratio number of droplets captured by the flue wall to the total number of droplets, optimization of atomizing nozzle layout, the atomization droplet diameter, flue gas enthalpy value, accurate calculation on the change of flue gas, and fly ash characteristics after the injection of FGD wastewater. We found that under different boiler load conditions, the higher temperature and the faster the speed of the flue gas, the less time it takes for the complete evaporation of the wastewater droplets. Different amounts of FGD wastewater can be completely dried, the properties of fly ash do not change much, and no negative impacts were found on the downstream process. Moreover, it was found that when the optimum atomization cone angle of a single flue structure was 65\u00b0, the size of vortex inversely proportional related to the distance between sprayer and the wall of flue duct, that was conducive to the continuous diffusion of the local droplets in the nozzle region to other regions. This wastewater evaporation treatment method is a feasible technology for ZLD of FGD wastewater with characteristics of short process, lower investment, low operating cost, and less maintenance than conventional membrane method for wastewater reduction and evaporative crystallization system.",

Water use (water balance) was measured at six fish processing steps, and effluent physicochemical and bacteriological analyses were carried out. Direct reuse was not indicated for any of the analyzed effluents, mainly due to high levels of total coliform bacteria (104 to 107 MPN/100\u2009ml). However, indirect water recycling and reuse can potentially be applied after a simple effluent primary treatment and disinfection from the freezing tunnel and cooling chamber defrosting, in order to supply cooling tower demands. This practice may reduce the total average water consumption of the processing unit by 11% and, if the effluents from the cooling tower purges were to also be reused for other administrative ends, this reduction may reach 21.9%, enhancing the competitiveness of this industry and preserving fresh drinking water.",

Groundwater was obtained from Bailin\u2019s landfill (Sabi\u00f1anigo, Spain), where liquid and solid wastes of an old lindane factory were uncontrollably dumped during decades. 28 COCs were identified and quantified by gas chromatographic analysis: five isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b5, \u03b3, \u03b4-HCH), benzene, 10 chlorobenzenes and 12 cyclic non-aromatic organochlorine compounds (\u03a3COCs\u2009=\u200993\u2009mg\u2009L\u22121). Batch-wise and column experiments were carried out using soil and groundwater from the polluted landfill. It was found that the dechlorination rate increases with the chlorine content of the organic molecule. Non-aromatic COCs with high chlorine content (from 5 to 7 atoms), as well as HCHs, were very rapidly eliminated in the presence of ZVIm via dechloroelimination, while conversions from 60% to 80% were obtained for chlorobenzenes at the end of the treatment, the last ones, dechlorinated via hydrogenolysis. It has been proved that ZVIm appears as an efficient, stable and cost-effective treatment for COCs reduction and the results obtained in the laboratory can be used at full scale. Therefore it was concluded that ZVIm can be used for the on site treatment of the pumped groundwater and also, for the in situ treatment (as permeable reactive barriers (PRBs)) of the groundwater, leading to the complete degradation of the most toxic COCs, those with higher chlorine content, less aromaticity and lower vapor pressure.",

Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are mainly applied for water treatment. Their rejection mechanisms and the interactions between PhACs and NOM or inorganic salts are well understood. It is consensual that tighter NF membranes are more efficient than looser membranes, reaching >99% of removal. Membrane distillation is a relatively new technology especially because of its robustness in dealing with a broad spectrum of pollutants, however only a few studied are focused on the application of MD in removing PhACs from water and wastewater and few are known about the rejection mechanisms and the interaction between PhACs, NOM, inorganic salts and membrane.

The hypothesis was that coagulation can be effective at removing turbidity causing species, alkaline earth ions and dissolved silicates from CSG associated water compositions. Both simulated and real CSG associated water samples were treated using a jar tester and addition of either aluminium chlorohydrate (ACH), aluminium sulphate (alum) or ferric chloride. All coagulants reduced turbidity (>95%) and also removed alkaline earth ions and dissolved silicates (ca. 29% for calcium; 0% for magnesium; 60% for barium; 21% for strontium; 33% for silica). Formation of a muscovite-like material was predicted using AqMB process simulation software to be responsible for silicate removal and barium sulphate precipitated when alum was used. Increasing turbidity and salinity did not appear to exhibit a significant impact upon coagulant performance. Notably, the co-presence of solution turbidity and organic matter in real CSG associated water samples promoted coagulant performance (ca. 75% for calcium; 30% for magnesium; 75% for barium; 50% for strontium; 48% for silica). This observation was ascribed to the promotion of polymeric Alb and colloidal Alc species which were more effective materials for water clarification (compared to monomeric Ala species).

Electrochemical coagulation (ECC) is capable of treating such tough and toxic waste streams offering a shortest treatment time \u226575\u202fmin with good settling and filterability characteristics. Batch ECC was applied successfully for treatment of real HCFWWs. Two dimensional (2D) aluminum (Al) and stainless steel (SS) electrodes were arranged in bipolar mode applying cell voltages 6, 12, 18 and 24\u202fV for \u226575\u202fmin electrolysis time (ET) with an inter electrode spacing of 10\u202fmm having an specific electrode area to volume (SA/V) of 20\u202fm2/m3. The optimum applied cell voltage using Al electrodes was 12\u202fV showing 88% removal of COD, 47% nitrate, 92% phosphate, 42% sulfate, 74% color and 70% odor free clear water worth a reclamation. SS electrodes removed 82% of COD, 46% nitrates, 88% phosphate, 52% sulfates, 71% color and 70% odorless supernatant. Batch ECC for optimum 12\u202fV were conducted for discrete ET using Al and SS for 5\u202fmin time interval up to 60\u202fmin to obtain intricate technical information.

The Arrhenius plot of the rate constants yielded an apparent activation energy of 72.0\u2009kJ mol\u22121 for B adsorption onto MgO, confirming that the uptake of B went through under chemical reaction control.

Combining the cultivation of microalgae for the production of these compounds with wastewater treatment renders the overall process very attractive and economically feasible.

In the present work, the effectiveness of Chlorella sp. for the degradation of p-cresol have been evaluated at a concentration ranging from 35 to 330\u2009mg/L. The effect of initial concentration on the contaminants removal, biomass productivity and the chemical composition of microalgae has been determined. Results shows that, Chlorella sp. can degrade p-cresol at concentration up to 330\u2009mg/L, and use it for biomass growth. Biochemical assay showed an improvement in the lipid productivity at higher concentrations, combined with the reduction in the protein content. The highest pigment composition was obtained at the optimum biomass growth, at 150\u2009mg/L.

For alkali and alkali-earth metal ions, the order of electrosorptive rates followed K+ > Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+, which revealed an inversely proportional relationship with their ionic hydrated radii. The relationship between electrosorptive rates and ionic hydrated radii, however, did not hold for heavy metal ions, and the order was Cu2+ > Pb2+ > Cd2+. The abnormal electrosorptive behaviors of Cu2+ and Pb2+ could be attributed to electrodeposition and formation of OH\u2212 complexes during electrosorption.

The accuracy of the numerical model was assessed by employing three criteria: mean residual error (MRE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). The numerical model tracked the observed values very closely (R2\u202f=\u202f0.9698).

     "abstract": "Acclimation of biological filters and ammonia oxidation at transient temperature regimes was the focus of the research. A batch system of automated temperature controlled tanks was used to determine effects of temperature on biofilter response to total ammonia nitrogen utilization. Each tank contained internal biofilters loaded with synthetic chemical feedstock. The biofilters were exposed to temperature regimes of 13\u202f\u00b0C, 20\u202f\u00b0C and 30\u202f\u00b0C steady state temperatures in the first experiment, and cyclical (diurnal) temperatures of 20\u202f\u00b1\u202f3\u202f\u00b0C and 30\u202f\u00b1\u202f3\u202f\u00b0C in the second experiment. A direct linear regression line method was used, with tau (\u03c4) value from the slope of the linear regression line used to determine the biofilter substrate utilization response to varying temperature regimes.Biofilter response was determined as the capability to utilize total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) by ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Tau (\u03c4) values for ammonia oxidation were 40.73\u202fday\u22121, 58.81\u202fday\u22121 and 159.70\u202fday\u22121 at 13\u202f\u00b0C, 20\u202f\u00b0C and 30\u202f\u00b0C respectively. Total ammonia nitrogen substrate utilization rates as indicated in a decay plot differed significantly (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) between temperature regimes 20 and 30\u202f\u00b0C. However substrate utilization between 13 and 20\u202f\u00b0C were not different (P\u202f>\u202f0.05).

     "abstract": "The addition of water treatment chemicals has always been considered as a standard operation in water and wastewater treatment. The concentration of chemicals was usually kept to the minimum necessary to achieve a good quality of potable or otherwise treated water. A significant interruption to the status-quo occurred more than 20 years ago after a severe and highly publicized outbreak of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. The strategic planning after the outbreak was to shift from physical-chemical to physical treatment methods, such as membrane filtration and UV disinfection. As such, the new procedures were supposed to eliminate the threat of water contamination through a minor addition of chemicals. Such was the mistrust and disappointment with water treatment chemicals themselves.Indeed, water treatment technologies are now using novel physical treatment methods. Membranes largely replaced granular filtration, and UV is paving the way towards minimization or elimination of the use of classic disinfection chemicals, such as chlorine and its derivatives. Yet, far from the \u201chigh-tech\u201d revolution in water treatment technologies actually reducing the use of chemicals, the latter has in fact been significantly increased. The \u201cconventional\u201d chemicals used for pre-treatment, disinfection, corrosion prevention, softening and algae bloom depression are all still in place. Furthermore, new groups of chemicals such as biocides, chelating agents and fouling cleaners are currently used to supplement them. These latter are the chemicals needed to protect the high-tech equipment, to optimize the treatment, and to clean the equipment between uses.The health effects of the new chemicals introduced into water are yet to be fully established. Typically, a higher treatment efficiency requires effective chemicals, yet these are not always environmentally friendly. It seems obvious that the \u201chigh-tech\u201d revolution currently affects the sustainability of water resources, and certainly not in a completely positive way. In short, the adverse effects of the introduction of such a significant amount of treatment chemicals into our sources of water are yet to be evaluated.",

However, there have been few studies identifying its environmental applications. This work, based on the batch experiments with quantification of surface charge and determination of colloidal properties, is an attempt to evaluate the ability of phytolith-based material (PBM) for removing Fe from aqueous solution. Oxidation and aggregation of a synthetic Fe-rich solution were examined under the presence of a PBM sample (obtained from fern Dicranopteris linearis) as functions of pH and ionic strength. Obtained results showed that through electrostatic interaction, the PBM can affect oxidation and aggregation of newly-formed Fe oxides at different extents depending on pH change. The fastest aggregation of the newly-formed Fe oxides was found at the pH range from 4 to 6 and in the presence of phytolith. As the PBM can make the newly-formed Fe oxides less dispersive and less transportable in aqueous solution, it suggests that practices for treatment of Fe-rich drainage or remediation of Fe-contaminated groundwater by supporting aggregation need to consider this effect.",

The addition of MeOH mimics the presence of industrial solvents and/or feedstuff in real industrial wastewater. The alcohol had a more retarding effect on the degradation of an aromatic pollutant relatively resistant to oxidation such as SA due to the presence of an electron-withdrawing group compared to a pollutant such as 1NA that has an electron-donating group. The azo bond in OG constituted a structural weakness leading to a comparatively more effective degradation of the aromatic moieties. Fe2+ was not only less effective than the commercial ZVI in activating PS; it was also more significantly retarded in its activity by MeOH. In addition, the surfaces of the ZVI were not oxidised, an advantage over ZVI nanoparticles, and they required no prior pretreatment indicating the probable suitability of waste iron filings for PS activation. As an activator of PS, ZVI is optimised at a size range of 0.1\u202f\u03bcm\u202f<\u202fd < 100\u202f\u03bcm. It was also demonstrated that the poor optimisation of PS concentration not only increases oxidant consumption or treatment time but also results in the persistence of undesirable aromatic degradation by-products. These results are important for the development of low-cost and effective industrial wastewater treatment schemes.",

Both set of fluxes data were later used as inputs in non-linear least-square fitting optimization to obtain the A, B and S parameters. The method were evaluated using two commercial FO membranes. We employed the mass-transport models that counting for internal and external concentration polarizations in the feed and the draw sides. We also demonstrated the use of the single-stage protocol to characterize fouled FO membranes. Overall results showed that all protocols are equally effective for characterizing FO membranes, demonstrating generality of the least-square fitting method. Furthermore, the single-stage protocol can be used for characterizing fouled FO membrane in situly. As expected, fouling was more severe for the active layer facing draw solution (ALDS) than the active layer facing feed solution (ALFS) mode, as was also reflected by larger changes of their properties relative to their pristine conditions. The ability to characterize fouled membrane using the single-stage protocol could help to unravel mechanisms of fouling in FO.

These functional groups in ozone treated MWNTs filters were found to play a pivotal role to remove benzene from aqueous solutions. It was found that compared to the pristine (P-MWNTs), the ozone functionalized MWNTs (O3-MWNTs) have a lower degree of entanglement and reduced nanotube diameters. Raman spectroscopy was used as a quantitative technique to make concentration measurements of benzene in aqueous solutions. The removal efficiency of benzene by O3-MWNTs could reach 99%. The adsorption capacity of benzene by O3-MWNTs could reach 193\u202fmg/g which is high compared with other adsorbents.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and NaOH solutions were used for pretreatment of the slags to adjust their dissolution properties. The modified slags exhibited better P removal performance at the beginning of the experiment, but had shorter lifespan than the unmodified slags. AOD and EAF modified with PEG and NaOH achieved 100% P removal during the first 84 and 60 pore volumes, respectively, which were \u226520 pore volumes longer than virgin AOD and EAF. However, virgin EAF and AOD both had a P removal efficiency above 90% during the first 280 pore volumes. Possibly, soluble minerals such as free lime are lost during the modification step, causing a decreased long-term P removal capacity. The XRD results showed that the high P removal ability of AOD and EAF was attributed to the dissolution of beta dicalcium silicate (\u03b2-C2) and gamma dicalcium silicate (\u03b3-C2S), which were dominant mineral phases in the slags. Results from SEM-EDS analysis revealed significant P accumulation on the slag surface. Cracks on the EAF slag surface contributed to its longer lifespan. Analysis with P K-edge XANES spectroscopy showed that the P retained on the slag surface was dominated by amorphous calcium phosphate, with a substantial amount of carbonate apatite (around 30%).

The hypothesis was that this innovative sorbent could outperform commercial granular ferric hydroxide (GFH). Sorbent performance was tested by a combination of sorption kinetics and equilibrium studies. Key factors evaluated included influence of phosphorous concentration, solution pH, and presence of competing anions. The kinetics of phosphorous sorption on both RMA and GFH were best described by the pseudo first order model, albeit the RMA material showed a higher rate of sorption. The equilibrium capacity as modelled by the Langmuir equation was 12.9\u2009mg\u2009P/g for RMA, which was over 140% greater than that of GFH. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggested that surface hydroxyl species were part of the mechanism for phosphorus uptake. The efficiency of phosphorous uptake by RMA was relatively unaffected by solution pH. In contrast with GFH, a significant loss in performance above pH 8 was found. It was postulated that point of zero charge on the sorbent and ability to release protons and chloride into the water may explain the pH data. Nitrate, sulfate, and chloride had minimal effect on phosphorus uptake by RMA or GFH, but both materials were impacted by the presence of carbonate species. Infrared spectroscopy indicated the presence of carbonate on the sorbent surface. Treatment of stormwater revealed that RMA was potentially suitable as a sorbent for phosphorus from real water samples.",

The change in Fe floc volume and of dissolved Fe and As were followed in aerated jar experiments. Fe floc growth was improved by addition of Ca2+ or Mg2+, and hindered by their removal. This hindered floc growth was more severe for groundwaters with higher P:Fe ratios, where Fe flocs carry a larger net negative surface charge, and rely stronger on Ca2+ or Mg2+ for charge neutralisation. When expressing the charge balance of the different groundwaters as the molar ratio (Ca2+ + Mg2+)/P, a linear relationship was found with the cumulative Fe floc volume, with a plateau at molar ratios >500. At environmentally relevant concentrations, H4SiO4 was found more likely to compete with As(III) for adsorption capacity than HPO42\u2212.

Average reductions of 93% and 98% were achieved for chemical oxygen demand (COD) and BOD, respectively, obtaining final values of 128\u2009mg/L COD and 12\u2009mg/L BOD. The total suspended solids (TSS) average reduction reached 99% in the same system, reducing the final value down to 3\u2009mg/L. Furthermore, 98% reduction in phosphorus (P) and a complete inactivation of total coliforms (TC) was obtained after 17\u2009min of ozonation. For total viable counts (TVC), a drastic reduction was observed after 30\u2009min of ozonation (6 log inactivation) at an injected ozone dose of 71\u2009mg/L. The reduction percentages reported in this study are higher than those previously reported in the literature. Overall, the combined process was sufficient to meet discharge requirements without further treatment for the measured parameters (COD, BOD, TSS, P, TC and TVC).",

Here, we have used glycerol- water mixed solvent to synthesize zero valent iron nanoparticles under aerobic condition and tested its reductive ability. The microstructural analysis reveals the presence of single flower-like pattern formed from petal-like structures, clustered at the center, while the XRD analysis points out to the presence of single phase particles, having negligible oxide impurities. This refers to the excellent sheathing ability of the viscous solvent during the growth of the nanoparticles. Different experimental conditions and parameters were involved to check the efficiency of the nanoparticles towards alachlor degradation. Within 2\u2009h, almost 90% of alachlor was degraded when the reaction was carried out by ultrasonic agitation under anaerobic condition. The pH variational studies suggested an optimum value of pH 5, at which the highest removal was achieved. Results also emphasized that anaerobic conditions during the reaction lead to higher removal efficacy. Hence, the results predict that nanoscale zero valent synthesized in glycerol medium is a prospective applicant to pesticide remediation.",

The conditions of coagulation/flocculation with regards to the dosage, pH, velocity gradient and slow-mixing time were optimized and some parameters such as floc aggregation (KA) and breakage (KB) coefficients were computed. Additionally, it was carried out a thermogravimetric analysis of the obtained sludge for both coagulants. The results showed no statistical differences between the performance of the two coagulants based on chemical oxygen demand, colour, turbidity and total solids removal. Particularly, the PAC showed higher alkalinity consumption and increased the electrical conductivity of the clarified wastewater, while tannin showed good performance within a wider pH, ranging from 5.0 to 10.0. Moreover, although the greatest KA values were observed for PAC usage, the tannin use presented higher resistance to floc breakage during the slow-mixing time. The obtained sludge from the experiments using tannin accounted for higher volatile solids and fixed carbon, and lower ash content when compared to PAC. In conclusion, tannin is a promising alternative for dairy wastewater treatment regarding its process performance and wastewater treatment residuals management.",

In this study, the effect of the rotation speed and the intensity of the electromagnetic field have been investigated. The main reason is to compare the effect of the hydrodynamic and the magneto hydrodynamic on breaking the oil/water emulsion. Results indicated that the hydrodynamic effect enhanced the removal rate of oil to some extent, and considerably reduced the energy consumption per each kg of oil removed (from 2.36\u2009kW\u2009h/kgoil at 0\u2009rpm to 1.46\u2009kW\u2009h/kgoil at 300\u2009rpm). Moreover, experiments also indicated that the application of electromagnetic field enhanced the oil separation in a relatively same manner. The best position of electromagnetic field is under the electrodes, where the corresponding arbitrary direction of the magnetic flux intensity is parallel to the surface of the electrodes. During the same time interval, the EMF enhances the oil removal percentage to be 94.8% compared to 72.4% without it. Accordingly, the application of the electromagnetic field in a continuous process would enhance the oil separation at relatively same power consumption.",

     "abstract": "Ammonia-containing wastewater often also contains sulfide, which severely inhibits biological nitrification. In this study, the applicability of a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) with a long fill period to achieve stable nitrification of sulfide-containing anaerobic digestion effluent was evaluated. During the start-up period, in which no sulfide was supplied to the reactor (Phase I, experimental days 0\u201318), ammonium was oxidized to nitrate stably after day 6. During the period in which sulfide was supplied at 32\u202fmg-S\u202fL\u22121 d\u22121 (Phase II, experimental days 18\u201330), the nitrification efficiency temporarily decreased to 79%, but recovered rapidly to 100% within two days. The sulfide tolerance of the sludge in the SBR was evaluated by batch bioassays at the end of the start-up period. The results showed that the half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) for the sludge was 0.73\u202fmg-S\u202fL\u22121, which was a typical value. Therefore, pre-existing sulfide tolerance of the sludge was not the main factor enabling stable nitrification during the sulfide supply period. Throughout the experimental period, the reactor was operated using a long sludge retention time of 139\u202fdays. The effective sludge retention in the SBR with a long fill period probably promoted the acclimatization of the microbes to sulfide, allowing the nitrification performance to remain stable even under sulfide supply.",

Pharmaceutically Active Compounds (PhCAs) may be present in natural waters and usually cannot be removed or degraded by conventional water treatment processes. For this reason, treatment techniques, such as Nanofiltration (NF) and Reverse Osmosis (RO) are recommended to improve their removal. In this context, the present study aims to evaluate the removal of five Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics and anti-pyretic: acetaminophen, ibuprofen, dipyrone, diclofenac, and caffeine by NF and RO process. NF90 and BW30 membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopic (SEM), contact angle and zeta potential. Retention of PhACs was evaluated considering pH feed solution and operating pressure. Results indicated that NF90 membrane was efficient to reach over 88% rejection for some selected PhACs. Best results were obtained at 20\u2009bar and pH 5 with more than 90% of rejection. For nonionic compounds acetaminophen and caffeine, exclusion by size is the main mechanism for rejection by NF90 membrane, whereas for anionic compounds ibuprofen, dipyrone, and diclofenac, electrical exclusion predominated at pH 5 and 7. Rejection results with NF90 membrane show that hydrophobicity has an important role due to the adsorption on the membrane surface. Conversely, lower rejections for hydrophilic compounds were observed due to the adsorption/diffusion mechanisms, both in NF90 and RO at pH 5.",

     "abstract": "Antioxidants (melanoidins and polyphenols) present in sugarcane molasses distillery wastewater are not readily biodegradable. However, these compounds exhibit potential physiological properties which may be tapped for food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical applications. Recovery of these compounds from distillery wastewater could thus lead to products of commercial interest while improving the conventional biological (anaerobic) treatment step. Three processes viz. ultrafiltration (UF), adsorption-desorption and solvent extraction were investigated for antioxidants recovery from distillery wastewater and selected fractions were subjected to biomethanation (anaerobic digestion). The effect of different adsorbents and solvents as well as operational parameters on antioxidants recovery was studied and the separated fractions were analyzed for melanoidins content, polyphenols content and antioxidant activity. UF through 100\u2009kDa membrane resulted in an antioxidant rich retentate (245\u2009mM TEAC) but the permeability was low. Solvent extraction with methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) led to 113\u2009mM TEAC recovery in organic phase. Adsorption on XAD16 resin followed by desorption with acidified ethanol enabled antioxidants recovery of 192\u2009mM TEAC. Antioxidant removal from the wastewater improves biomethanation. Overall, adsorption on XAD16 resin followed by biomethanation (74% COD reduction and 71% methane in biogas within 25 days) appears to be promising for improving the existing biomethanation facility while recovering antioxidants with potential commercial value. Further analysis of the antioxidants fraction is required to ascertain the content of specific commercially viable polyphenols.",

Therefore, the possibility for controlling the competition is important for practical application of anaerobic treatment processes of sulfate-containing sludge. In this study, the activated sludge was enriched with sulfate concentration and was treated with various concentrations of nanoscale zero valent iron (nZVI) in order to evaluate the potential of nZVI for alleviating the methanogenesis inhibitation of sulfate-containing activated anaerobic sludge. Generally, due to sulfate anions, the outcomes of this study showed that a rapid accumulation of partially stabilized organic materials was observed which indicates that the whole anaerobic digestion process was ceased. The results also reveal that nZVI contributed to significant increases in methane yield. Meanwhile, SRB in the presence of nZVI can react with sulfate to produce sulfide and subsequently can be precipitated as iron insoluble sulfides due to the sulfate reduction by nZVI. The results demonstrate that nZVI was readily utilized as an electron donor for methanogenic bacteria and sulfate reduction and hence has an assuring potential in waste sludge treatment applications.",

They were synthesised using simple, quick, and reproducible methods. Both adsorbents were characterised chemically, physically, and magnetically via different analytical techniques. The particle size of the adsorbents varied between 60 and 200\u2009nm, which led to a tendency to agglomerate, and the surface area varied between 30 and 70\u2009m2/g.

First, coprecipitation of both ferric and ferrous ions in alkaline medium followed by oxidation of magnetite into maghemite leads to a stable colloidal dispersion called ferrofluid. A sodium alginate solution was then added to the ferrofluid in order to obtain the magnetic nanocomposite. This approach combines the advantages of a biopolymer with magnetic properties of the maghemite nanoparticles. The morphology, structure, size and composition of the magnetic nanoparticles were characterized by means of atomic absorption spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform-infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Adsorption is one of the most efficient treatments for the removal of pollutants from wastewater. But the development of efficient and environmental friendly adsorbent still remains challenging. Using AlgMNP as a magnetic adsorbent could be a suitable response to this challenge. Its adsorption efficiency was investigated by using methylene blue as pollutant. The effects of pH, contact time, and initial concentration of the dye on adsorption were investigated. The high adsorption capacity with respect to the dye in a wide pH range (273\u2009mg/g) was explained by the way magnetic nanoparticles bind to the alginate chains. We assumed an organization with alginate strands decorated by the magnetic nanoparticles leaving the adsorption sites of the particles more accessible rather than a configuration with a complete coating of magnetic nanoparticles by alginate. The reusability was successfully demonstrated through 10 adsorption/desorption cycles.",

     "abstract": "Recovery followed by re-use of process-water obtained from dairy effluents by means of reverse osmosis technology is one route that can provide the dairy industry with the possibility to reach sustainable water regimes. However, membrane fouling is a phenomenon that limits both the efficiency and increases the running costs of such reverse osmosis units and can potentially alter the quality characteristics of permeate water. In this paper, several industrial-scale RO membranes used for recovery of process-water from whey UF permeate have been examined for their fouling tendency. At the end of a complete clean-in-place (CIP) protocol based on alkaline-acid formulations, biofouling appears to be the main issue in the investigated RO-elements. Between 4.19 and 5.69 log10 (CFU\u202fcm\u22122) of viable microorganisms still remained on the membrane retentate surface and, more surprisingly, evidence of significant contamination was found on permeate side of these particular membranes. Microbiological analysis indicate that minor loads of microorganisms do pass into the permeate streams but final UV treatments ensured final process-water with non-detectable levels. There is a need for optimization of cleaning procedures and finding the best compromise for achieving surface disinfection while still preserving membrane integrity and not compromising the water quality.",

     "abstract": "The foreseeable increase of bioethanol production by distilleries will inevitably lead to an important increase in production of the associated effluent, namely vinasse. Due to its high pollution load, characterized by high chemical oxygen demand, high salt content and heavy dark color, the depollution of this effluent is mandatory before release into nature. In this work, we reviewed the literature on the main physicochemical and biological treatments of sugarcane vinasse and emphasised on the technological valuation of vinasse that allows to shift the status of the effluent from waste to valuable resource. The membrane systems seem to offer the best depollution option but they are subjected to strong technical limitations. Several alternative processes have been proposed, but they generally fail to treat the entire organic load of waste when used in stand-alone technology, while generating higher investment costs in the treatment process. The biological processes turn out to be particularly promising as they are able to produce interesting metabolites from living cells. Among them, production of biogas through anaerobic digestion is by far the most developed and economically viable process for treatment of vinasse. However a few works, also using vinasse as a growth medium, have been published on development of innovative technics to produce single cell products such as lipids, proteins, organic acids, alcohols or enzymes. In the medium term, technologies to produce third generation biodiesel are developing to complement and compete with fuels derived from petroleum. Finally, the development of hydrogen production processes from vinasse is emerging, thus preparing us for a long-term decarbonised economy.",

Degradation reactions of THMs were carried out under identical conditions with addition of silica nanospheres. Concurrently, simulations of cavitation bubble dynamics were carried out. Mesoporous silica nanospheres with the largest surface area and the highest mean pore diameter yielded the highest enhancement in degradation of the THMs. These results were also corroborated by H2O2 dosimetry. The concentration profiles of the THMs were fitted to pseudo 1st order kinetic model. Although mean pore sizes of mesoporous silica nanospheres were smaller than minimum threshold radius for transient cavitation, these nanospheres provided surface-induced and pore-induced nucleation to augment cavitation bubble population in medium. The highest nanosphere\u2013induced enhancement in degradation was obtained for CHBr3, while the highest total degradation was obtained for CHCl3. With concurrent analysis of experimental and simulations results, an attempt is made to deduce the predominant physical mechanism of degradation of the THMs.",

     "abstract": "The objectives of this pilot-scale study were to evaluate biological acclimation of virgin granular activated carbon (GAC), quantify the impact of nutrient (phosphorus and nitrogen) enhancement and to compare the performance of parallel biologically active carbon (BAC) filters operated continuously or cyclically (12\u202fh/day), with respect to removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and disinfection by-product (DBP) precursors. Virgin GAC media outperformed biologically active carbon for an initial 4-month period in terms of DOC reduction (30%), as expected based on the superior performance associated with adsorption compared to biodegradation. Once the adsorptive capacity was exhausted and the media was biologically acclimated, the performance of the new GAC was statistically similar in terms of organic carbon and disinfection by-product precursor removal to a filter containing media harvested from a filter operating biologically for 12 years. Phosphorus addition to the filter influent (0.3\u202fmg PO4-P/L; C:N:P\u202f=\u202f400:1:30) had a small impact on DOC (3\u202f\u00b1\u202f2%) and THM formation potential (5\u202f\u00b1\u202f3%) reduction when compared to biofiltration without nutrient enhancement. Ammonia nitrogen added to the filter influent (0.8\u202fmg NH4-N/L; C:N:P\u202f=\u202f200:40:1) was completely consumed through the biofilter; however, no impact on measured performance parameters was observed. Cyclical operation of full-scale biofilters resulted in a modest, but significant improvement in DOC removal (3\u202f\u00b1\u202f2%) when compared to continuously operated pilot filters. Genotyping of both cyclically and continuously operated biofilters (with varying GAC ages) showed similar community composition; however, differences in the phylogenetic diversity of the samples were evident.",

     "abstract": "Access to clean water is one of the challenges of the 21st century. Thus water purification is inevitable. One method of water treatment is purification by magnetic particles in the presence of magnetic field. The contaminants are attached to the magnetic particles and then by applying a magnetic field, magnetic particles and, thus, the pollutants can be collected. For the optimal design of a water treatment system, the effect of important parameters in the design, such as magnetic fields, particle size, and Reynolds number are determined numerically by modeling and simulating the water treatment process. Two methods are used to create the magnetic field: permanent magnet and coils. It is shown that there is very little difference in the collection efficiency. Particle size is varied from micrometers to nanometers. In general, the collection efficiency increases by increasing the particle diameter and decreasing the Reynolds number. For example, it is shown that with a magnetic field of strength 0.05\u202fT and Reynolds number of 100, particles with a diameter of 30 micrometers and above are collected completely. However, with decreasing particle diameter to the nanometer, collection efficiency finds a sharp drop. Using baffles to shift the particles toward regions with stronger fields, it is possible to increase the collection efficiency for nanoparticles.",

The porous PDMS structures are prepared using sugar as a sacrificial template. The typical size of the pores in the sponge varies from 10\u202f\u03bcm to 100\u202f\u03bcm. The surface and the pore wall of the PDMS sponge are decorated with TiO2 nanoparticles which are mostly present as an aggregate. These PDMS composite sponges were shown to remove organic pollutants such as the toxic dye Rhodamine B from water efficiently and selectively, via synergistic effects of adsorption and photocatalytic degradation. These sponges first remove a significant amount of the dye from solution by adsorption (\u223c50% removal) even in the absence of light. Upon exposure to solar light, the dye adsorbed on the surface of the TiO2-PDMS sponge was photocatalytically degraded, resulting in the further removal of the dye from solution (total 80% removal). The overall dye removal efficiency TiO2-PDMS composite sponge is comparable with that of a similar amount of the TiO2 in solution. However, the application of composites eliminates the need for complicated separation of the powder catalyst from the solution. Most importantly these composite sponges could be easily regenerated by exposing them to solar light. The excellent performance and the recyclability of these cost-effective TiO2-PDMS sponges suggest their promising applications in textile wastewater treatment.",

     "abstract": "As graphene-like materials are demonstrated as non-metal catalysts to activate persulfate (PSF)/peroxymonosulfate (PMS), co-doping sulfur and nitrogen with graphene is a promising approach to improve catalytic activities. In this study, a convenient one-step approach is adopted to prepare sulfur-doped graphitic carbon nitride (SCN), which shows crumpled morphology and porosity on its surface, making SCN exhibit a much higher surface area than the common CN. Chemical analyses also confirm that a part of N atoms in CN skeleton are substituted by S. To evaluate PSF/PMS activation by SCN, decolorization of Rhodamine B (RhB) is selected as a model test. SCN showed a much higher catalytic activity than carbon nitride (CN) to activate PSF/PMS for RhB decolorization. Behaviors of PSF/PMS activation by SCN are explored by evaluating various effects on RhB decolorization, including temperature, pH, and salt. SCN-activated PSF/PMS for RhB decolorization is much favorable at elevated temperatures and neutral conditions. The presence of NaCl does not significantly inhibit the PSF/PMS activation by SCN. Several radical inhibitors on SCN-activated PMS are also evaluated and the RhB mechanism is shown to involve both sulfate and hydroxyl radicals. Potential mechanisms of PSF/PMS activation by SCN are proposed and ascribed to the more active carbon sites of SCN induced by the co-dopants of sulfur and nitrogen. SCN can be also re-used to activate PSF/PMS without catalytic activity loss. These features demonstrate that SCN is a conveniently-prepared but effective and sustainable non-metal heterogeneous catalyst for activating PSF/PMS.",

The thermodynamic results indicated that the adsorption was exothermic and was mainly controlled by enthalpic factors. The efficiency of this sorbent was more than 87% at low concentrations (e.g. 128\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL\u22121).

Under optimized conditions established as inlet pressure of 5\u202fbar and pH of 4, subsequent studies for the degradation of DDVP using combined approaches of HC with Ozone (HC\u202f+\u202fO3) as intensified pretreatment were performed. It was established that the combined approach significantly enhanced the degradation to 84.8% with TOC reduction of 39.4%. Further, biodegradation analysis of HC and HC\u202f+\u202fO3 pretreated DDVP aqueous solution was performed. A maximum kinetic rate constant as 64.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22123\u202fday\u22121 was obtained for pretreated DDVP solution using the HC\u202f+\u202fO3 combination, which was about 10 times higher as compared to the case where untreated solution of DDVP (kinetic rate constant as 5.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22123\u202fday\u22121) was directly used for biological oxidation.

In this study, polymeric microfiltration membranes were modified by adsorption BisBAL, which is a synthesized chelate using bismuth and have a high anti-bacterial effect on various microorganisms, on the membrane surface using dip coating (DC), spin coating (SC), and low pressure-treated coating (LPtC). The purpose was to increase the surface hydrophilicity, change the surface charge, and gain the surface an anti-bacterial characteristic. It was found that the higher adsorption time, lower feed flow rate and higher spinning velocity, and pressure application increased the efficiency of the process during DC, SC, and LPtC, respectively.

     "abstract": "Wastewater streams generated during the leaching process of precious metals recovery (e.g. gold, silver) contain high concentrations of toxic compounds, being free cyanide (CN\u2212) one of the most important among them. Free cyanide is a toxic compound that affects cellular respiration and causes irreversible environment problems. Thus, effective wastewater treatment processes should be applied to reduce CN\u2212 without producing other contaminants. This study evaluated the effect of rotational speed and carbon source on the biological removal of CN\u2212 present on gold mine wastewater, using a rotating biological contactor (RBC).A factorial design (23) was developed by triplicate (N\u202f=\u202f24) to evaluate: carbon source concentration (commercial sugar cane, 99% sucrose), free cyanide concentration (CN\u2212), and rotational speed (\u03c9) on the biological removal of free cyanide (%B.R.). The bioreactor worked on continuous system under the following conditions: VRBC\u202f=\u202f4.2L, FI\u202f=\u202f0.42L/h (gold mine wastewater at 10 or 300\u202fmg\u202fCN\u2212/L, liquid culture media with or without carbon source, final pH\u202f=\u202f10.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5), HRT\u202f=\u202f10\u202fh, and \u03c9\u202f=\u202f5 or 10\u202frpm.According to the factorial analysis: free cyanide concentration ([CN\u2212]i), carbon source concentration ([FC]i), and rotational speed (\u03c9) affected significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) during the biological removal of CN\u2212. Furthermore, the highest biological removal percentage (96.89%) was achieved when the RBC worked under the following conditions: [CN\u2212]i\u202f=\u202f300\u202fmg/L, [FC]i\u202f=\u202f3.8\u202fg/L, and \u03c9\u202f=\u202f5\u202frpm; even though dissolved oxygen reached levels below 2\u202fmg/L. Thus, biological removal increased when free cyanide and carbon source concentrations were at their highest level 300\u202fmg/L and 3.8\u202fg/L, respectively; however rotational speed (10\u202frpm) diminished the bioprocess.",

Treating the river water is the prime project in India due to disposal of effluent discharge.

Seven experimental set-up each comprising of an Erlynmeyer flask containing Zarrouk\u2019s medium supplied with sterile air and kept under different wavelengths, were used. Effects of different energy fluxes were investigated on the production of A. platensis. Optimum illumination wavelength selection was based on the comparison of maximum specific growth rate (\u03bcmax). Sunlight exhibited \u03bcmax of 0.45\u202fday\u22121 and maximum biomass productivity of 16.77\u202fmg/L/h, i.e. highest among others. Energy flux per unit power for the corresponding source of illumination was 6.05\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u221221\u202fs/m2. Optimum wavelength was further used for microalgae cultivation in Yamuna water. Culture was acclimatized to Yamuna water using sequential increased levels to maintain the \u03bcmax. Biomass productivity of 10\u202fmg/L/h and removal efficiencies of 99.76% for nitrate, 99.22% for lead, 100% for nickel, 90.80% for cadmium and 68.57% for copper, were achieved.

The knowledge of an approximate hydrodynamic behavior can contribute to the rational design of such operation. Thus, the aim of this work is to investigate, in a pilot scale pond bioreactor, the non-ideality through residence time distribution (RTD) technique and validation of a model for the homogeneous phase material balance. Experimental runs were carried out using the pulse injection technique of methylene blue tracer at constant water flow rate. The pilot-scale reactor constructed with a typical geometry design of those employed in animal waste treatment in southern Brazil. Residence time of 3, 6, and 9\u202fdays and a height/width ratio geometry parameter (H/D) of 0.25 and 0.18 were adopted. For each run normalized RTD functions and their moments (average residence time, variance and asymmetry) were evaluated. Variance analysis shows equivalent hydrodynamic behavior in the parameter range employed. To describe the non-idealities, we theorized several dimensionless RTD function models using a series of CSTRs (classified as conventional, bypass and recycle).The models were adjusted to the experimental data by non-linear regression and evaluated by the successive calculation method using the moments of RTD. The best model found is the representation of the pond reactor as two CSTRs in series with different volumes (first reactor with 91.5% of useful volume) and presence of dead zones (useful volume 84.9% of real volume).",

These model foulants were chosen to represent carbohydrates, proteins, humic substances and fatty acids. Inter foulant interactions and their influence on membrane flux loss was established by running series of fouling tests with feed solutions containing mixtures of model foulants. The obtained results demonstrated that under our experimental conditions humic acid (HA) and octanoic acid (OA) had no significant role on permeate flux loss during wastewater treatment over short periods. However, alginate and bovine serum albumin (BSA) and their mixtures caused significant total flux loss, through alginate-calcium complexation that led to the formation of a resistant gel layer on the membrane surface. Protein fouling was mainly attributed to multiple layer adsorption onto the polyamide membrane surface. Mixing alginate with BSA saw a further decline in permeate flux, worse than that caused individually by either of the foulants, and gives an indication of the synergistic effect between the two foulants. There were favourable inter-foulant interactions between the carbohydrates and the proteins that promoted the formation of hybrid aggregates that were deposited on the membrane surface and enhanced flux loss. The additional presence of humic acid to the mixture of BSA and alginate further aggravated membrane fouling. Polysaccharides and proteins were found to be the most dominant foulants during wastewater reclamation. The extent of interactions between the organic foulants had an effect on the fouling layer structure and its role in permeate flux loss.",

The combined treatment of leachate with sewage has been used in various sewage treatment plants in the world. However, there are still many questions and uncertainties about the process, especially the effects of adding leachate to the treatment system. In this context, the objective of this work is to evaluate the efficiency of combined leachate/sewage treatment in activated sludge under different conditions. Treatability experiments were carried out using a bench scale (SBR) process using the volumetric proportions of 0 (control), 2 and 5% leachate under different experimental conditions. Experiment 2 (leachate pre-treated by alkalinization and air stripping) was technically more feasible, achieving removal efficiencies of BOD, COD and DOC above 97%, 82%, 60%, respectively, and the highest diversity indices of the bacterial and eukaryotic communities and flake structure stability were observed up to a volumetric ratio of 2% of pre-treated leachate. The DGGE technique used showed that populations of eukaryotes were apparently the most affected with increasing proportions of 2%\u20135% of the mixture, mainly for experiments 3 (B3R2) and 4 (B4R4), where the lowest diversity indices of these populations were found.",

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) assessed the decoration of microspheres of carbon particles in CX matrix with bundles of MWCNTs. Nitrogen adsorption at \u2212196\u202f\u00b0C revealed that the N2 uptake was enhanced when CX was decorated with MWCNTs and the specific surface area (SBET) increased from 192 to 643\u202fm2/g. The resulting hybrids are mainly microporous materials. Rising the amount of MWCNTs from 1 to 4\u202fg/L led to a decrease in the SBET from 643 to 515\u202fm2/g (i.e. decreased approximately 20%). Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) and Boehm's titration showed that both acidic and basic oxygen functional groups were equally distributed while carboxylic groups were increased considerably by increasing the amount of MWCNTs. The efficiency of adsorption and catalytic oxidation properties of CX/MWCNTs nanohybrids towards removal of rhodamine B (RB) was examined. Adsorption equilibrium data were analyzed using five different adsorption isotherms, i.e. Langmuir, Freundlich, Flory-Huggins, Halsey and Elovich models. The equilibrium adsorption results proved that adsorption of RB dye onto these nanohybrids can be well-fitted using Langmuir and Halsey isotherms. These nanohybrids exhibited considerable adsorption capacities that varied from 154 to 256\u202fmg/g. The catalytic performance indicated that the investigated nanohybrids could eventually be used for the removal of RB dye in presence of H2O2 and visible light within 60\u202fmin, affirming that the CX/MWCNTs obtained are effective materials in liquid-phase applications for treating dye-contaminated industrial wastewater.",

Chemical amendment of CSG associated water was best conducted using sulphuric acid addition instead of hydrochloric acid due to cost considerations. However, the sulphate or chloride added to the CSG associated water restricted amendment processes to water samples comprising of <1000\u202fmg/L bicarbonate ions. Use of weak acid cation (WAC) and strong acid cation (SAC) resin effectively remediated low salinity water samples (conductivity <650\u202f\u03bcS/cm). For CSG associated water of higher salinity, SAC resin produced better water quality; albeit, less volume of WAC resin was required and this material is inherently easier to regenerate. Ion exchange was preferred to chemical amendment as acid addition detrimentally increased the amount of anions present in solution (sulphate or chloride) and thus limited the irrigation potential for the treated water. Regardless of the remediation strategy, dosing with a source of calcium was required to manipulate sodium adsorption ratio to meet regulatory guidelines.

A total of three IA cycles (IA1, 150\u202fmin aeration on and 30\u202fmin off; IA2, 120\u202fmin aeration on and 60\u202fmin off; IA3, 90\u202fmin aeration on and 60\u202fmin off) were evaluated in the present IFAS reactor. Specific EPS production (mg/g of suspended solids) was found to be following the increasing trend with respect to the non-aeration to aeration time ratio, whereas, the sludge production followed the reverse trend. The amount of bound EPS was observed to be much higher (6\u201310 times) than soluble microbial product (SMP) in each intermittent aeration phase. During all the investigated IA cycles, the pilot was observed to be significantly affected in terms of biomass characteristics, which was also confirmed by increasing trends of sludge volume index (SVI) and filamentous index (FI) values. In-situ monitoring and measurement of reactor operation parameters such as pH, oxidation reduction potential (ORP), and dissolved oxygen (DO) was also done in all IA cycles. A maximum of 27.05% reduction in electrical energy was observed in highest non-aeration period cycle.",

     "abstract": "Produced water is a wastewater from oil and gas industries which contains harmful pollutants. It is crucial to treat the produced water properly before reuse or to be disposed of. Membrane separation technology have been applied for produced water treatment. However, this method encountered the problems such as fouling. In this research, the membrane technology was designed as double stages to overcome the fouling problem. In the double stages mode, the first stage was responsible for rejecting organic foulants and the second stage contributed to reduce dissolved solids. Specifically, modified nano hybrid membrane was implemented and this research is aimed to evaluate the membrane performance during filtration processes using single stage and double stage system. The nanohybrid PES/nano-ZnO membranes were prepared via NIPS methods followed by surface modifications via UV irradiation and thermal annealing treatment. Result of SEM images showed that UV irradiation on the membrane surface confirmed more finger-like porous structure and thinner dense layer. Water contact angle measurement showed that the nano-ZnO incorporation and UV irradiation increased hydrophilicity by lowering the water contact angle from 63\u00b0 to 53.63\u00b0. Filtration tests exhibited that the flux increased up to 18% and rejection of TDS improved up to 15% in double stages process. The double stages process also presented less foulant deposition on the membrane surface. It was demonstrated that the concept of double stages process in filtering produced water provided a better performance than the conventional filtration.",

However, the related empirical models are yet to be fully comprehensive to study the adsorption mechanisms of natural adsorbents. This paper discusses developed empirical model used to estimate the mass transfer of organic pollutants into two natural fibres \u2013 coconut fibres and oil palm fibres to filter pollutant molecules in water. An empirical model was developed to estimate the mass transfer of organic pollutants in water onto the fibres in a fabricated physical model. The mass transfer relations were derived based on the substrates loading rates and the predicted accumulation rates of substrates in fibres along with the percentage of outflows. Matching empirical results with experimental results showed that the modified model was able to accurately predict the mass transfer rate. The higher adsorption rate of CF (91.02% COD) depicted greater global mass transfer rate (1.3696\u202fd\u22121) than OPF (82.35% COD) which only had 1.2768\u202fd\u22121 of global mass transfer rate in 3% of COD outflow. The contribution of internal diffusion mechanism was significant due to the physical (porosity) and chemical (lignin and cellulosic content) characteristics of both CF and OPF. The study concluded that the performance of biological adsorption using CF and OPF is promising.",

Precipitation is conducted with synthetic wastewater in semicontinuous mode. For low excess sulfate, an induction time of a few hours is observed. As the excess sulfate is increased and/or as barium sulfate seeds are added, precipitation proceeds within a few minutes. Besides, the excess sulfate improves barium ion removal due to the common-ion effect. Residual supersaturation ratios were found to lie within the range of 1.1\u20133. These values were associated with a fourth order dependency of the molecular growth rate with the supersaturation ratio. Calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate dihydrate were found to be ineffective heterogeneous seeds to barium sulfate precipitation.

The Shannon diversity index as a measure of bacterial diversity showed decreases from 3.181 to 2.614 during warm and cold seasons. The dominant phyla in all samples was Proteobacteria comprised 63% of the total isolates. Overall, the results showed that the diversity of bacterial communities was higher in warm months rather than cold months. Although, volatilization has usually a significant role on the removal of volatile organics such as phenol, benzene, toluene, and styrene from the liquid phase, the presence of isolated bacterial species indicates their contribution in removal process.

BPED is performed with a two-cell electrodialysis unit composed of an anion exchange membrane (AEM) sandwiched between two bipolar membranes (BPM). A semi-batch type operation was performed by circulating solutions through the cells, namely, the removal and concentration cells. The volume ratio of the reserve tanks for the feed stream to the cells was set to 4:1 (removal: concentratation). Tetrahydroxyborate ions were transported from the removal cell to the concentration cell through the AEM. In the ideal case, the boron concentration in the concentrate should be concentrated to 5 times the initial concentration, when the solutions of the same initial concentration were supplied to both cells of concentration and removal. The concentrated solution was then used for second step to further concentrate the solution. This concentrated solution was then used for third step, and so forth. The operation was continued step-by-step until the boron concentration was sufficiently high to easily recover boric acid. The experimental results with a stack of five cells for the sodium borate solutions (initial concentration: 100\u202fmg/L) showed that the boron concentration in the concentrate was about 4, while that in the diluate was less than 10\u202fmg/L, which is below the regulatory value for waste water in Japan. After four steps, the boron concentration in the concentrate reached close to the solubility of boric acid (ca 10,000\u202fmg/L), at which boron can be recovered for recycling.",

This study evaluated the effectiveness in removing arsenic at 5 different pH values (5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) as well as the mechanism of resolubilization for solids. Moderate pH values of 6, 7, and 8 were found to be the most effective for arsenic removal. Resolubilization occurred at all pH values because dithionite was consumed under UV irradiation. A simple kinetic model was applied to describe the changes in concentrations of arsenic and dithionite with time. Arsenic removal kinetics was fast at the first 10\u201320\u202fmin for all pH values.

     "abstract": "A post-denitrification process, known as enhanced biological phosphorus removal and recovery (EBPR-r), was recently developed to facilitate phosphorus (P) recovery from municipal wastewater. This process utilises a biofilm containing phosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs) to capture P from wastewater and then release the captured P into a separate smaller stream for recovery. The addition of external carbon in the EBPR-r process is expected to be a main operating cost. Hence, it is important to ensure that the added carbon, which is stored internally as poly-\u03b2-hydroxy-alkanoates (PHA) within PAOs, is predominately used for P uptake. This study explored the ability of PAOs to conserve their storage-driven P uptake activities following exposure of the biofilm to oxidising and P-deficient conditions for extended periods (up to 7\u202fdays). Even after 2\u202fdays of exposure the biofilm retained a similar ability to up take P (1.20\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.09\u202fmg-P/g total solids). Beyond 2\u202fdays of exposure, a decline in P uptake activity was noted, with only 15% activity remaining by day 7. This study provides the first evidence of the ability of PAOs to conserve their storage-driven P uptake activities. This unique behaviour of PAOs may enable flexible operational strategies, such as infrequent carbon replenishment, to be implemented (i.e. facilitate multiple P uptake phases before an anaerobic carbon replenishment). Such flexibility may reduce the capital and operational costs of the EBPR-r process, increasing the economic incentive for P recovery from wastewater.",

The galvanic system uses iron-copper electrodes to produce Fe2+ in situ. For the GF system, hydrogen peroxide was applied to produce hydroxyl radicals. The GF system does not require energy, unlike the analogous electro-Fenton system, and, in fact, it is possible to generate an electric current (\u223c220\u202fmV) from the chemical reactions. A synergistic effect was observed with GF treatment at pH 2.8 and a H2O2/Fe2+ ratio of 19:1 (i.e. 7840\u202fmg H2O2/L and 408\u202fmg Fe2+/L), leading to high removal percentages for color (76%), soluble chemical oxygen demand (71%), and total organic carbon (79%), while degradations of 43% and 48% were achieved for biochemical oxygen demand and nitrates, respectively.Fluorescence and IR spectroscopy analyses of raw and treated wastewater samples were performed with the aim of establishing the anthropic origin of the dissolved organic matter. Fluorescence spectroscopy showed that GF treatment eliminated the anthropogenic organic matter associated with aromatic groups and proteins, enhanced effluent biodegradability, did not increase toxicity, and reduced the sub-lethal effects observed for lettuce radicles. Most importantly, the removal efficiencies of GF treatment were comparable with those of analogous electrochemical advanced oxidation processes based on Fenton reactions.",

However, the influence of sodium salts upon electrocoagulation operating parameters is not well understood. Therefore, a multi-electrode electrocoagulation cell with aluminium electrodes was used to investigate the impact of polarity reversal period, electrode history, sodium chloride/sodium bicarbonate concentration, floc characteristics and starting solution pH. Effluent pH exhibited oscillating behaviour which related to electrode passivation, with cleaner electrodes raising pH and electrodes with oxide coatings decreasing pH due to variations in anode dissolution and oxidation of water. Polarity reversal could lower cell resistance by de-passivating the electrode surface with a 3\u202fmin reversal time recommended. However, electricity (2.56\u202fkWh/kL) and electrode consumption (0.448\u202fg/min) were enhanced. Imaging revealed that the presence of sodium chloride induced extensive pitting corrosion of the aluminium electrodes, whereas pitting was only observed with high concentrations of sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate suppressed pH oscillation due to electrode passivation. The amount of electrode consumed was greater than predicted from Faraday\u2019s Law and as such non-electrochemical processes occurred. The wear of electrodes was uneven with those with highest load at the EC cell extremities wearing the fastest. Floc settling rates were relatively slow and not significantly impacted by salt concentration. The settled volume after 1\u202fh was still greater than 60% of the initial volume, which may cause issues with floc separation.

In this paper, an electronic antifouling device is presented which, not only prevents limescale formation, but also removes existing scale in plumbing tubes, at insignificant energy consumption. Induction of a Radio-Frequency Alternating Electric Field (RFAEF) in water at a specific range of frequency and antenna voltage, along with its distinct sinewave waveform, changes the way minerals precipitate, minimizing hard-lime scale by producing instead a non-adherent mineral powder in the bulk water. Moreover, the unsaturated solution that is created, along with enhanced carbon dioxide production, dissolves gradually the existing scale in plumbing tubes. Furthermore, the RFAEF inductance device demonstrates a major improvement over other pulsed-power systems, proving this electronic antifouling technique suitable for both hard and soft waters, as well as for large-scale applications.",

However, water reuse needs to be regulated based on applicable and legally binding guidelines, therefore the lack of a regulatory framework hampers this practice and its benefits. The Czech Republic, as many other countries, has an absent water reuse legislation. In this study, a pilot-scale tertiary treatment was installed at Milevsko Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) in South Bohemia (20,000\u202fP.E.) to demonstrate the effluent quality that can be achieved and evaluate the reuse potential, especially on non-potable applications, such as industry and irrigation. WWTP secondary effluent was treated by three separated technologies: Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF), sand filter and Filtra-lite\u00ae filter; followed by ultraviolet (UV) disinfection. Results on water quality were compared to Czech standards for drinking and non-drinking water, and to some international benchmark regulations for water reuse. Our results have led us to initiate the introduction of legislation regulating wastewater reuse in the Czech water management framework.",

The hypothesis was that utilization of waste to treat waste can potentially result in environmental and economic benefits. The performance of Bayer liquor and Bayer precipitate was compared with conventional alkalis used for AMD neutralisation such as lime (Ca(OH)2), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). Target ions to remove from the AMD solution included Al (1233\u202fmg/L), Cu (77.26\u202fmg/L), Fe (16.7\u202fmg/L), Ni (1.54\u202fmg/L), Mn (161.5\u202fmg/L) and Zn (48.89\u202fmg/L)). Both alumina industry wastes were shown to produce treated water with acceptable discharge limits for all metals except Mn. Nevertheless, Bayer precipitate was shown to have an enhanced ability to remove manganese at lower pH (6.5\u20137.5) relative to lime, with residual Mn concentrations of 32.30 and 85.40\u202fmg/L, respectively. Manganese discharge limits were challenging to meet due to pH values >9 being required wherein not only aluminium species redissolved but also the pH was not compatible with discharge regulations. Mechanistically, larger precipitates were found to positively influence the removal of heavy metals, with lime and Bayer precipitates forming the largest precipitates. Overall, Bayer precipitate was found to be a potential alternative for the treatment of AMD water.",

Nitrification would solve the problem of insufficient ammonia retention faced by the high pressure membrane systems at the Ihlenberg landfill, which aims to achieve clean water recoveries up to 95%. This study investigated the feasibility for ammonia removal using four lab-scale reactors packed with three different packing materials (coke, expanded clay beads and polyethylene carrier) over a period of about 400\u202fdays. The research work studied the nitrification of two process streams: reverse osmosis concentrate (RO) of raw leachate (having high dissolved organics content) and nanofiltration permeate of RO retentate (with a low concentration of organics), to identify advantages/disadvantages arising from the differences in their composition. The organics contained in the leachate were observed to cause inhibition. Due to this reason, the maximum nitrification rate obtained in the presence of organics was about 570\u202fg N-NH4+/(m3\u202fd), whereas in their absence up to 1.2\u202fkg N-NH4+/(m3\u202fd) could be achieved. Although coke packing because of its higher specific surface area and rugged surface favoured faster biofilm development; due to its ability to adsorb organics and thus also promoting the growth of heterotrophs, it was found to be more vulnerable to clogging.",

For CC, the jar test was used to determine both the most favorable dosage of coagulant and pH of the process (i.e., 600\u202fmg/L of Al2(SO4)3 at pH of 9.3). CC let to remove ca. 93% of turbidity, 53% of COD and 24% of TOC. It also increased BOD5/COD ratio of raw textile wastewater from 0.16 to 0.27. Next, CC effluent was treated by EO.

The negative impact of suspended particles on UV disinfection efficiency has been established. The aim of this study was to provide plant operators with a simple way to predict water quality degradation. To this end, simple correlations between indicators of suspended particles contamination and UV disinfection efficiency of activated-sludge effluents were explored using effluents from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in the South of France. Three groups of microorganisms were considered: coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci. To test activated-sludge effluents of varying quality, secondary effluent was blended with different volumes of mixed liquor from the aeration tank of the WWTP. The number of particle greater than 25\u202f\u03bcm was found to be well-correlated with total suspended solids (TSS) (R2\u202f=\u202f0.88), turbidity (R2\u202f=\u202f0.94) and UV transmittance at 254\u202fnm (UVT254) (R2\u202f=\u202f0.81). Large particles were shown to impact UV disinfection at two main levels: they scattered UV light and they shielded bacteria inside their compact cores. Linear correlations were determined in this study between indicators of suspended particles presence and 1) inactivation constant of the UV-susceptible fraction of the microorganisms studied, 2) residual bacterial counts after exposition to high UV fluence (tailing potential).

Bulk DOM is known to be a major membrane foulant in MBR. Active biomass activity, which depends on operating parameter variations, is a major source of DOM, due to soluble microbial product (SMP) secretion. To establish the link between DOM, active biomass concentration, operating conditions, and later membrane fouling, heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria were first quantified using respirometric measurements. Comparing their evolution with operating conditions and parameters using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), SRT and temperature were identified as the parameters with the most impact on active biomass concentrations. Proteins from Biopolymers and humic substance (HS\u202f+\u202fBB) concentrations were quantified using a 3DEEM pseudo-quantitative method. Active biomass and DOM concentration fluctuations were similar, confirming that DOM was mainly constituted by SMP produced by the active biomass, and consequently dependent on SRT and temperature modifications. HS\u202f+\u202fBB were produced eight times faster than Proteins from BP and therefore accumulated faster on the membrane despite their low membrane rejection. Consequently, large amounts of HS\u202f+\u202fBB can accumulate, modifying the initial membrane properties. The membrane resistance evolution was dependent on Proteins from Biopolymers accumulation and these molecules showed no fouling propensity modifications despite seasonal variations. As a consequence, this study strongly emphasized the interest of using a 3DEEM pseudo-quantitative method for on-line application in order to follow the full-scale MBR process and membrane fouling.",

     "abstract": "Reverse osmosis (RO) has become a common method for treating wastewater and removing several harmful organic compounds because of its relative ease of use and reduced costs. Chlorophenol is a toxic compound for humans and can readily be found in the wastewater of a wide range of industries. Previous research in this area of work has already provided promising results in respect of the performance of an individual spiral wound RO process for removing chlorophenol from wastewater, but the associated removal rates have stayed stubbornly low. The literature has so far confirmed that the efficiency of eliminating chlorophenol from wastewater using a pilot-scale of an individual spiral wound RO process is around 83%, compared to 97% for dimethylphenol. This paper explores the potential of an alternative configuration of two-stage/two-pass RO process for improving such low chlorophenol rejection rates via simulation and optimisation. The operational optimisation carried out is enhanced by constraining the total recovery rate to a realistic value by varying the system operating parameters according to the allowable limits of the process. The results indicate that the proposed configuration has the potential to increase the rejection of chlorophenol by 12.4% while achieving 40% total water recovery at an energy consumption of 1.949\u202fkWh/m3.",

Lab-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were operated with glucose or ethanol as only carbon sources, with HRT in the range 0.25\u20134\u202fday and SRT in the range 1\u201371\u202fday. The highest OLR values which gave satisfactory performance were 4.28 and 4.14 gCOD/l.day for glucose and ethanol, respectively, which are among the highest reported for conventional aerobic suspended-growth processes. The highest OLR values were obtained with HRT\u202f=\u202f0.25\u202fday, SRT\u202f=\u202f3.1\u202fday for glucose and HRT\u202f=\u202f0.5\u202fday, SRT\u202f=\u202f4.9\u202fday for ethanol. The minimum oxygen consumption was 0.36 and 0.69\u202fkg O2/kg COD removed for glucose and ethanol, respectively. In disagreement with conventional theories, it was found that biomass production also depended on the OLR as well as on the SRT, higher OLRs giving lower biomass production for the same SRT.

     "abstract": "This study describes the application of TiO2 in different forms (anatase, P25, TiO2 commercial), ZnO and Nb2O5 for barium ions (Ba(II)) reduction by photocatalysis process. Specific surface area (B.E.T method), X-ray diffraction and photo-acoustic spectroscopy techniques were applied for the catalysts characterization. The parameters studied in the reaction were: presence of additives, pH, amount of catalyst, effect of inorganic compounds, adsorption, photolysis, type of catalyst, additives and the time of contact of the additive/catalyst. No significant reduction in the Ba(II) concentration was observed in absence of additive, however a reduction higher than 50% was observed in the presence of addictive after 120\u202fmin of reaction time. Moreover, the effect of Cl\u2212 ions, generally present in natural waters, indicated an increase in the Ba(II) reduction time. The adsorption and photolysis tests were not efficient in the Ba(II) removal. However, the contact time between the additive (formic acid) and the catalyst, before the photocatalytic process, showed an improvement in the catalytic activity for all catalysts studied. Therefore, the photocatalysis tests indicated that the catalysts that showed the highest efficiency in the Ba(II) removal were anatase, P25 and ZnO, respectively. The maximum percentage of Ba(II) removal was obtained using anatase as catalyst and at optimized conditions Ba(II) removal was higher than 99% were obtained a reaction time of 90\u202fmin.",

     "abstract": "This study investigates settling and drainage properties of Biological Trickling Filter (BTF) sludge for dewatering and mineralisation potentially using natural Sludge Treatment Wetlands (STWs). Sludge settling experiments were conducted to determine solid removal efficiency using 1-L Imhoff cones (after 1 hour) and its effect on the removal of particulate components such as BOD5, TN, and TP was investigated. Drainage experiments were also conducted in the laboratory to measure the Specific Resistance to Drainage (SRD, describing sludge dewaterability) and sludge settling velocity to determine gravitational drainage of the BTF sludge. Excellent solid removals (68\u201395%) were achieved after 1 hour settling of BTF samples, reducing BOD5, TN and TP concentrations by 72%, 48% and 55% respectively. Dewatering experiments showed that while the settling velocity of the sludge (6.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fm/s) was \u223c15\u201350 times faster than that of typical activated sludge (in the order of 10\u22125\u202fm/s), the SRD of the sludge (\u223c6\u202f\u00d7\u202f1010\u202fm/kg) was \u223c2\u201315 times higher than that of activated sludge. Anaerobic conditions in the sludge and vigorous mixing greatly increased the SRD (up to 3.4\u202f\u00d7\u202f1011\u202fm/kg), increasing the time for dewatering. This result suggests that while the sludge can be easily removed from BTF effluent by simple gravity sedimentation, dewatering of the sludge may be much slower than for typical activated sludge. Sludge Treatment Wetlands (STWs) combining sludge drying beds with vertical flow constructed wetlands could be applicable for dewatering and mineralisation of the BTF sludge. However, the STWs may require a larger land area than one treating activated sludge due to the lower dewaterability.",

Docking by Biosolve IT software was used to calculate docking score, identify active site residues and molecular interactions between laccase and azoreductase of both bacteria with dye. Docking score and decolorization percentage were assessed comparatively. UV\u2013vis spectroscopy, HPLC, FTIR and GC\u2013MS were performed for biodegradation analysis.

Docking studies analyzing interactions between dye and dye-degrading enzymes were in agreement with decolorization percentage. Biodegradation analysis supported biotransformation of dye into simpler products. Enzyme studies revealed high expression of dye degrading enzymes in both non-acclimatized bacteria on exposure to azo dyes compared to controls. It was suggested that A. hydrophila MTCC 1739 and L. sphaericus MTCC 9523 can be used for efficient decolorization and biodegradation of azo dye containing textile wastewater.

The inhibitor obviously affected the procedure of crystal growth. The morphology of the CaCO3 crystals, in the absence of inhibitor, showed a predominant content of rhombohedral crystals (calcite), whereas in the presence of inhibitor we could observe a mixture of calcite with acicular crystals (aragonite) and a small content of spherical crystals (vaterite). Concerning CaSO4 crystals, thin needles with a smooth surface were observed in the absence of the inhibitor, which became thicker with many crystal defects in the presence of the inhibitor.Consequently, the new aminophosphonic acid described here can be used as a potential scale inhibitor.",

     "abstract": "Discharges of phosphorus (P) from on-site wastewater treatment systems generally contribute to eutrophication problems in Swedish freshwaters and, ultimately, in the Baltic Sea. Such concerns have led to a growing interest in improving P removal in treatment facilities. This study investigated the reduction of P in 12 full-scale on-site treatment systems featuring sand filters and alkaline P-filters by sampling and analysing filter influents and effluents. The flow-proportional samples collected were analysed for total and dissolved P, BOD7, total and dissolved organic carbon (TOC and DOC), and pH. Seven of the eight investigated sand filters did not provide satisfactory total P reduction; the likely explanations are filter clogging and wastewater dilution by extraneous water. In addition, effluents from four of the eight sand filters had total P concentrations higher than 3\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121, which is the Swedish effluent limit recommended for common receiving waters, indicating that a subsequent polishing step would be needed. Six of the nine investigated P-filters reduced P adequately, with total P concentrations in the effluent ranging between 0.1 and 1.9\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121. The three underperforming P-filters had effluent pH values below 9; filter age, clogging, and hydraulic overload were identified as probable reasons for their poor performance. A statistically significant correlation was found between total-P reduction and filtrate pH, but no significant correlation was detected between organic load in the influent and P reduction by the P-filters. The P-filter media replacement frequency could not be established, but filtrate pH appeared to be a good estimator.",

In this work, nine different commercially available ultrafiltration membranes, having different nominal molecular weight cut-offs (10\u2013300\u202fkDa) and made of different polymeric materials (polyethersulfone and regenerated cellulose), were screened for treating PPW streams obtained from bird washer and chiller operations. Wastewater samples were treated for recycling and reuse purposes. Bird washer wastewater was found to cause more fouling as it contained higher biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), fat, oil and grease (FOG) and total suspended solid (TSS) compared to the chiller wastewater.The presence of suspended particles can lead to plugging of the membrane pores. Thus, it is important to select the most appropriate membrane (pore size, polymeric material, flux, etc.) that minimizes fouling and maximizes contaminate rejection. For the feed streams considered here, membranes with 30\u202fkDa nominal molecular weight cut-off provided the most stable performance in laboratory scale tangential flow filtration. Larger pore size membranes displayed rapid flux decline most likely due to entrapment of smaller particulate matter within the membrane structure. These particles were excluded from the smaller pore size membrane by size exclusion. The particle size distribution of the feed stream affected the level of contaminate rejection. Significant removal of BOD (up to 93%), COD (up to 94%), TSS (up to 100%) and FOG (up to 100%) was obtained for both wastewater streams.",

For both resins, batch adsorption experiments involved optimality of pH, contact time, adsorbent dosage followed with concentration effect and kinetic studies. Equilibrium, kinetic, and thermodynamic models were considered for their fitness with the obtained Pd(II) batch adsorption characteristics. Among both resins, Lewatit TP-214 resin provided better performance in terms of adsorption and desorption characteristics along with optimal combinations of pH (8), equilibrium time (300\u202fmin), and adsorbent dosage (2\u202fg\u202fL\u22121). Overall, both resins provided significantly lower Pd(II) absorption capacity and removal% for ELP systems in comparison with aqueous solutions. This is due to the inhibitory role of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and ammonia during Pd(II) binding with active sites on the resins. The obtained desorption characteristics and associated Pd (II) adsorption and desorption mechanisms are promising to further commercial application of the said resins.",

     "abstract": "Water eutrophication is a serious global issue that needs urgent attention. Ammoniacal nitrogen (AN) is present in both domestic and industrial wastewater which acts as one of the main contributors of eutrophication. There is a need to reduce AN to permissible levels as enforced by local authorities before final discharge. Phytoremediation has been recommended as an alternative solution to other conventional physiochemical and biological methods to treat wastewater with high AN content due to its cost-effective, environmental friendly and sustainable characteristics. Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is a free-floating macrophyte, which is known as the most noxious weed in the world that shows characteristics of fast growth rate, adaptability to a wide range of environmental conditions and high nutrient uptake capacity. These capabilities contribute to the wide applications of water hyacinth for phytoremediation purpose. This paper provides extensive review on the technical advantages and limitations of phytoremediation as compared to other nitrogen removal technologies, as well as the insight for the development of phytoremediation technology using water hyacinth to treat wastewater with high AN content. This paper also provides fundamental knowledge on the AN removal mechanisms and necessary considerations in selecting the operating conditions of water hyacinth-based phytoremediation system, which may facilitate the design of industrial scale phytoremediation system for effluent treatment. Overall, phytoremediation technology assisted by water hyacinth has been shown to be promising for AN removal, which can be a potential solution in the future for various industries to reduce the AN level in their effluent discharge.",

Many technologies, including the Fenton reaction and electrooxidation processes, have been evaluated to remove drugs from water, in the last years. However, the association of different approaches can be a suitable solution when only one technology is not enough. In this frame, this study compares the use of the Fenton reaction, the electrochemical process and coupled process to treat a synthetic effluent containing a potential pollutant, rifampicin. Regarding the electrode materials studied herein, efficiency of rifampicin degradation decreased in the following order: Boron-doped diamond (BDD)\u202f>>\u202fTi/Pt\u202f>\u202fTi/Ru0.3Ti0.7O2 (DSA, Dimensionally stable anode). The better performance of BDD was associated to the species BDD(OH), which degrades organic compounds more efficiently than the species RuO(x+1) and PtO(x+1). The electrochemical reaction employing BDD was as efficient as the Fenton reaction where 80% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was removed. However, the Fenton reaction was faster. Results also clearly showed that, when both technologies were associated, no significant improvements were achieved. Nevertheless, when hydrogen peroxide was added to the electrochemical process, a remarkable enhancement of the reaction efficiency was attained, especially in the case of BDD, requiring less energy for treatment this kind of effluent.",

     "abstract": "This study concerned aluminium exchanged strong acid cation resin for the removal of alkaline earth ions from simulated coal seam gas (coal bed methane) associated water samples which comprised of significant bicarbonate concentrations. The hypothesis was that use of aluminium exchanged resins for water softening would require only one regenerant stage, thus avoiding health and safety issues associated with strong acids and alkali on a coal seam gas water treatment site. Equilibrium exchange tests revealed that the selectivity of the aluminium exchanged resin was in the order Ba\u00a0>\u00a0Sr\u00a0>\u00a0Ca\u00a0>\u00a0Mg, albeit the exchange was unfavourable unless a stoichiometric excess of bicarbonate ions was present in solution. Equilibrium studies of multi-component solutions of alkaline earth ions indicated that at low loadings the alkaline earth ions co-sorbed on the resin surface, but the more preferred ion displaced ions of lesser affinity as monolayer exchange was approached. The presence of sodium ions not only reduced alkaline earth ion loading when in concentrations relevant to coal seam gas associated water application but also appeared to be incorporated into flocs in the form of salts. Column studies revealed significant loading of alkaline earth ions (0.787\u00a0eq/kg resin) but regeneration with AlCl3 (aq) did not recover all these species (0.67\u00a0eq/kg resin). Partial restriction of the flow was noted during column tests due to floc formation. A subsequent loading/regeneration cycle resulted in further diminishment in alkaline earth ion uptake and an inability to achieve low effluent concentrations of alkaline earth ions.",

A cross-flow membrane system was integrated to succeed continuous treatment. The effect of electrode combination (Fe and Al), current density (50\u2013100\u00a0A/m2), pH (5.0\u20139.0), and operating time (0\u201360\u00a0min) on the treatment of wastewater were investigated to obtain maximum treatment efficiency. The maximum removal efficiencies of color and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were obtained as 99.2 and 60.5%, respectively, at the electrode combination of Al/Al, current density of 100\u00a0A/m2, pH 7.0, and reaction time of 60\u00a0min. In order to improve treatment quality, a cross-flow membrane process was integrated to the sono-electrocoagulation process. Nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes were tested. The combined sono-assisted electrocoagulation and membrane system supplied 100% color and 90.8% COD removal efficiency when supported with RO membrane. The results indicated that the proposed integrated process supplied higher pollutant removal compared to the alone electrocoagulation and sonication process. Operating cost of the combined process was calculated as 1.83 $/m3. Moreover, the genotoxic effect of brewery wastewater was also assessed by comet assay before and after treatment.

Several conventional techniques such as adsorption, ion exchange process, reverse osmosis, electrochemical, chemical, and biological methods have been developed for removal of nitrate, however they have several limitations such as requirement of post-treatment, less efficiency, and high installation costs. The field of Nanotechnology has observed tremendous growth in the past and has many environmental applications such as the use of nanomaterials for soil and water remediation, filtration of pollutants, water purification, biosensors, and in desalination. Recently, Nanotechnology has emerged as an excellent alternative for nitrate removal over conventional techniques. Nanomaterials due to their small size have large surface area and thus have high reactivity which, enables them to be used as reducing agents and adsorbents. This review focuses on the use of different nanomaterials especially nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanofibers, nanoshells, nanoclusters, and nanocomposites for removal of nitrate from an aqueous system. The limitations of using such nanomaterials for removal of nitrate and possible techniques to overcome these limitations have been discussed as well.",

The approach has been to examine and model the decline in permeate flux resulting from membrane fouling. Effluent from a WWTP at a papermaking factory, previously filtered, was used as feed. UF experiments were carried out in a laboratory-scale plant using a 10\u00a0kDa polyethersulfone (PES) UF membrane in a flat sheet module with an active area of 154.8\u00a0cm2. The transmembrane pressure (TMP) (1\u20133\u00a0bar) and crossflow rate (1.5\u20134.5\u00a0L/min) were varied during the experiments, at constant temperature (22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00b0C). Experimental results from UF tests were expressed in terms of permeate flux (Jp) as a function of time to check modified Hermia\u2019s models adapted to crossflow filtration. The parameters of these models were theoretically estimated. The predicted results were compared with experimental data with a high goodness of fit. The results showed that the phenomenon controlling fouling, under most of the conditions tested, was intermediate blocking (R2\u00a0>\u00a00.96). Measurements of particle size distribution and zeta potential near the isoelectric point, showed a substantial reduction in colloidal compounds. Additionally, given that COD was removed down to 110\u00a0mg/L, it could be said that UF is suitable for producing water that can be reused in different papermaking processes.",

With a typical lag and log phase, decreasing As(III) and increasing As(V) concentrations in the effluent of the sand columns were observed in a timeframe of weeks. The growth of biomass in the sand columns was confirmed with ATP analysis. ATP concentrations on the sand grains increased from 0.7\u202fng/g to 16, 8 and 2\u202fng/g filter sand stratified from the top of the sand filter to the bottom, respectively.

AGMBR has also achieved, to varying degrees, the removal of organics and nitrogen-based compounds from wastewater. However, scanty information is available in the literature on phosphorus removal in AGMBR. Thus, the present study focused on simultaneous removal of organics and both nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in AGMBR at semi-pilot-scale. Aerobic granules were cultivated in a cylindrical reactor with a working volume of 19\u202fL, diameter of 15\u202fcm, and height-to-diameter (H/D) ratio of 8. The effluent from the granular reactor was discharged into a side-stream membrane module.

The outstanding removal of both organics and nutrients in the AGMBR is attributed to the coexistence of aerobic and anaerobic layers within the granule as well as the anaerobic feeding adopted. These findings demonstrate the potential of AGMBR to simultaneously remove organics and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphate)",

The experiments were performed using UF membranes with molecular weight cut-off 10, 50, and 100\u202fkDa. Humic acid, shrimp feed, Spirulina sp., Vibrio harveyi and IHHNV were used as contaminant models. Scanning electron microscope was used to visualize the presence of foulant on the membrane surface. The results showed that fouling behavior was affected by both membrane cut-off (pore size) and foulant type. Two fouling behaviors were observed: (i) rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by relatively constant permeate flux until experiments finished, and (ii) rapid flux decline at the early stage of filtration followed by a gradual decrease in permeate flux. Due to its reliable flux value and high rejection, 100\u202fkDa UF membrane should be considered as the most suitable UF membrane for RAS application.",

A solution of activated sludge from the biological treatment unit of a wastewater treatment plant was used as a feed solution (FS), with an initial total suspended solids (TSS) concentration of 6198\u202fmg/L. Residual brine from a stuffed olive factory was used as a draw solution (DS) because of its osmotic potential (equivalent to 1.2\u202fM NaCl). This resulted in an increase in the initial FS concentration to around 16,850\u202fmg/L.

When electrolysis and ozonation were applied together, the rate constant of atrazine degradation could not be explained simply from considering the processes when applied separately. In particular, at pH 7, the measured first-order rate constant was 0.3441\u202fmin\u22121, a rate 4.78 times as large as the estimated additive rate (0.072\u202fmin\u22121) from electrolysis and ozonation separately in the same conditions.

Use of tert-butanol as a radical scavenger elucidated that HO contributed to a majority of the reaction at pH 7 and 12. The increasing impact of HO was due to ozone decomposition into HO through reaction with hydroxide (OH\u2212) in both the bulk solution and at the cathode.

Closed water loop recycling solution after trying a number of treatment option is proposed for achieving sustainability in industrial water consumption. UV/H2O2/O3 was evaluated as the most effective combination with reuse potential of 663,000\u00a0m3/year (with 85% water recovery, 100% color, and 60.1% COD removal) whereas the performance of ozone (O3), ozone/ultraviolet (O3/UV) and ozone/hydrogen peroxide (O3/H2O2) was almost the same. However, highest color and COD removals were achieved using Fenton oxidation but reusability potential was zero. Treated wastewater (by O3, O3/UV, UV/H2O2/O3, O3/H2O2) was safely recycled for dyeing purposes with 35% and 20% less NaCl and Na2CO3 addition to dye bath, respectively. The estimated saving was calculated as 122,400 US$/year for this reduction.",

Batch adsorption experiments systematically investigated the influence of contact time, metal ion concentration, adsorbent dosage, solution pH and regeneration of the adsorbent. The kinetic data fitted well with pseudo-first-order model and the equilibrium was reached within 4.0\u00a0h with 73.7% removal of lead (II) ions from aqueous solutions. The Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models were applied to describe equilibrium data. The adsorption isotherm followed Langmuir model with maximum adsorption capacity of 47.169\u00a0mg/g at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. The adsorption of lead (II) ions from aqueous solution was found to be pH dependent. The thermodynamic study confirmed that the adsorption was spontaneous and exothermic in nature. The regeneration of GBC with 0.1 (N) nitric acid was found excellent with ten adsorption-desorption cycles of reusability. Thus, GBC was found to be a superior adsorbent compared to other adsorbents due to its remarkable reusability after syneresis for lead (II) ions removal from aqueous solutions.",

     "abstract": "This paper presents options for the recovery and recirculation of ammonium sulphate (AS) and/or ammonium bisulphate (ABS) additive in a process for mineral carbonation referred to as the \u00c5A route. The process uses magnesium silicate rock (serpentinite) reacting with AS and/or ABS in order to extract magnesium which subsequently will be carbonated. A challenge still is to find ways to recover the chemicals in an efficient way and this paper addresses options for this. The concepts and possible implementation for reverse osmosis separation, precipitation by the addition of alcohol, multiple-step extraction and ion selective membranes/ion exchange resins are presented. It was shown that reverse osmosis membranes will need high pressures in order to achieve sufficient separation. Addition of alcohol (ethanol) will make it possible to precipitate AS, magnesium and iron sulphates. This enables some separation of AS from ABS since ABS remains dissolved in the solution, but subsequent separation and recovery of ethanol from water is in turn required. Multiple-step extraction was tested with a procedure containing both thermal and wet extraction. It was shown, however, that precipitation of some species resulted rather than extraction, which has to be further investigated. The multiple-step extraction procedure included different ratios of rock: AS and/or ABS; it was shown that AS plays an important role in the thermal extraction even if ABS is a more aggressive chemical. The option to apply ion selective membranes for the recovery of ABS is part of ongoing work: first results are promising, as presented here.",

The photodegradation activity was tested varying the initial concentration of RhB and the amount of carbon-doped titanium dioxide, taking into account the ratio between the amount of catalyst and the amount of RhB (TiO2/RhB), thus obtaining a parameter that allows the method to be scaled up without losing its effectiveness. Values of k2 and t0.5 were obtained by fitting kinetics data to a second-order kinetic adsorption model. The important role played by doped TiO2 particles is demonstrated by the highly efficient color removal obtained during the visible light-induced photocatalysis.

The residual total iron concentration was 1.14\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 at 1\u00a0min of process time and then remained stable.

Fluoride in water resources remains a significant problem worldwide often preventing or restricting beneficial use. This study undertook kinetics, equilibrium, and column tests to determine the effectiveness of Lanxess TP208 resin for fluoride removal over a range of solution fluoride concentrations and pH. Fluoride uptake was significantly influenced by both solution fluoride ion concentration and pH. Equilibrium studies suggested the maximum loading of fluoride ions was 1.3, 12.4, and 60.7\u00a0g F/kg resin for fluoride concentrations of ca. 10, 100 and 1000\u00a0mg/L, respectively at a solution pH of 6\u20137.5. Decreasing the solution pH to ca. 5.5 by addition of sulphuric acid resulted in a 27% increase in maximum fluoride loading to 15.7\u00a0g F/kg TP208 resin at a solution fluoride concentration of 100\u00a0mg/L. Significantly, the sorption process did not release chloride ions or any other detectable anions into solution. Sodium ions were removed from solution stoichiometrically with fluoride. Column studies confirmed the impact of fluoride concentration upon resin performance and suggested that multiple pathways may facilitate fluoride uptake. Future studies should focus on understanding whether imino-diacetate chelating resins exchanged with alternate metal (III) species (e.g. La, Ce, Fe) can effectively remove fluoride ions, the impact of competing ions on resin performance and how to regenerate sodium fluoride loaded resins.",

While the adsorption efficiency of PAC has been thoroughly investigated in the past, no studies on its flocculation behavior and recommendations for operating large-scale PAC flocculation processes are available up to now.In this study, flocculation experiments were performed using secondary treated wastewater samples, a commercially available PAC product and an iron-based coagulant. Single- and two-stage flocculation processes were simulated in laboratory scale under variation of coagulant dosage, stirring rates and retention times in each process stage. In order to obtain real-time quantitative results, the flocculation process was continuously monitored by Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement and evaluated with regard to the reduction of a fine particle fraction sized <10\u00a0\u03bcm. The flocculation kinetics were modelled by exponential curves, taking into account mass transport limitations in the first phase of the process as well as equilibria between floc growth and break-up at longer retention times. On this basis, optimum operating parameters for PAC flocculation were determined and strategies to meet fluctuating process conditions were deduced. By operating a fast mixing stage at velocity gradients of 50\u201390/s for 10\u00a0min and, subsequently, a slow mixing stage at 20/s for 10\u00a0min, the concentration of particles sized <10\u00a0\u03bcm could be reduced by around 99%.",

We have combined the advantage of high selectivity hydrotalcite (HTC, (Mg6Al2(OH)16(CO3)\u00b74H2O)), with large surface area of active alumina (AA, (Al2O3)) for effective removing of the dissolved silica from cooling tower water. The batch test results indicated the combined HTC/AA is a more effective method for removing silica from CTW than using each of HTC or AA separately. The silica uptake was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Results indicate HTC/AA effectively removes silica from cooling tower water (CTW), even in the presence of large concentrations of competing anions, such as Cl\u2212, NO3\u2212 HCO3\u2212, CO32\u2212 and SO42\u2212. The Single Path Flow Through (SPFT) tests confirmed to rapid uptake of silica by combined HTC/AA during column filtration. The experimental data of silica adsorption fit best to Freundlich isotherm model.",

     "abstract": "Nowadays, photocatalytic oxidation has been pledged as a valuable process for air and water purification due to its capability in degrading organic pollutants. In this study, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanocomposite membrane consisted of electrospun titanium dioxide nanofibers (PVDF/TNF) was prepared by hot pressing TNF onto PVDF flat sheet membrane. Titanium dioxide nanofibers (TNF) were successfully fabricated through electrospinning technique, in which electrospun from a precursor solution consisted of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP), ethanol and acetic acid. They were then heat-treated under different calcination temperatures ranging from 400 to 600\u00a0\u00b0C. The morphological properties of TNF were characterized via scanning of electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). From the results collected, it is shown that the heat-treated TNF were consisted of anatase and rutile phases, whereas the un-treated TNF only possessed amorphous phase as analysed by XRD analysis. As a matter of fact, TNF-500 displayed satisfactory morphological structure, along with fiber diameter and crystalline structure compared to other TNF, thus TNF-500 was chosen for further testing. In addition, selected TNF have successfully deposited onto PVDF membrane as there is no visible lift-off. By introducing TNF into PVDF membrane matrix, said course of action resulted in a tremendously enhanced BPA photodegradation up to 85.88%. Even though the calcination process implemented on TNF has been reduced to about 4% in photocatalytic activity, further optimisation study on the loading of TNF-500 in PVDF membrane matrix could highlight favourable features of calcined TNF-500 for BPA degradation reaction.",

Dyes removal by adsorption is an attractive method due to the effectiveness and economic viability. Thus, in the present work, a low-cost adsorbent, obtained by using polyurethane foam coated with chitosan film (0.51\u00a0wt%), was developed for textile reactive dyes removal in aqueous solutions. Polyurethane foam chitosan-coated (PU chitosan-coated) was characterized by zeta potential, Fourier transformed infrared and scanning electronic microscopy. For the isotherms adjustment, as well as, the determination of the influence of the temperature, adsorption kinetics, and adsorbent reuse capacity, batch experiments were carried out using reactive blue dye RB198. The experimental data were evaluated by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm, and the data showed a better correlation with Langmuir isotherm with a maximum adsorption capacity of 86.43\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121. In addition, in this work, it was verified that even after seven reuse cycles of adsorption, the PU chitosan-coated was efficiently in the RB198 dye remove, confirming the advantage of the proposed PU chitosan-coated as a low-cost adsorbent.",

The focus of the work is on understanding the effect of various parameters such as catalyst loading, UV power and using sunlight as alternative to UV as well as using H2O2, ozone, potassium persulfate (KPS) and ultrasound as process intensifying combinations for maximizing the extent of degradation. It has been established that 0.2\u00a0g/L as the catalyst loading, use of catalyst obtained using the ultrasound assisted approach and UV power of 16\u00a0W are the optimum conditions for individual operation of photocatalytic oxidation. For the combination of UV with H2O2, studies with different loading of H2O2 revealed that an optimum H2O2 loading of 10\u00a0ppm resulted in maximum of 82.53% of degradation. Studies with different ozone flow rates established that an optimum ozone flow rate of 1L/min resulted in degradation of 55.07% and 56.09% for the approaches of only ozone and combination of ozone with UV light respectively. Studies for combination with KPS revealed that an optimum KPS loading of 0.4\u00a0g/L resulted in a maximum degradation (99.59%) among all the approaches also yielding a COD reduction of 95%. Integral method of analysis was performed and it was observed that pseudo-first order kinetics explained the degradation very well. Overall it can be established that ultrasound plays an important role in giving the better catalyst and also combination approach of UV with KPS is the best treatment approach.",

Laboratory scale sorption columns of EG could reduce the oil concentration in produced water from 278 and 66\u00a0mg/L to 1.2\u00a0mg/L, and undetectable, respectively. A separate experiment with TOC (total organic carbon) demonstrated that TOC decreased from 566\u00a0mg/L in the feed solution to 1.5\u00a0mg/L in the effluent. Both results (oil densitometer and TOC) showed excellent ability of EG for oil removal from produced water. SEM and FT-IR observations confirmed the deposition of oily material on the surface of EG during the water treatment process. TG-DTA of oil-sorbed EG showed a gradual weight decrease in the temperature range between 100\u2013600\u00a0\u00b0C, being considered to be the decomposition of sorbed oil. Raman spectroscopy and XRD measurements of EG samples, before and after the treatment, indicated no structural change of EG.

Aquatic toxicity was tested using freshwater fish Labeo rohita and the variations in fish histopathological, biochemical, enzymology, hematological and immunological parameters were analyzed. The intermediatory dye metabolites and secondary amines produced during chemical (96hLC50\u00a0=\u00a05%) and bacterial remediation (96hLC50\u00a0=\u00a015%) had enhanced the stress factor and organ damage in the exposed fish. In phycoremediation, though the newly explored Odontella aurita could effectively absorb metal ions than other algal species and moderately reduce effluent physical parameters, but was less efficient in the removal of azo dyes from the effluent (96hLC50\u00a0=\u00a050%). Subsequent physical remediation had removed these dyes and other effluent solid sludge, and had enabled the fish to survive acute toxicity (96h+). However, it was less efficient in removing the secondary metabolites produced during bacterial (96hLC50\u00a0=\u00a020%) and chemical (96hLC50\u00a0=\u00a025%) remediation. Secondary phycoremediation had effectively reduced effluent physical parameters, metal ions and the hydroxyl radicals left over after primary chemical remediation. Therefore, this combined chemical and phycoremediation processes had enabled the fish population survive short term chronic toxicity (168h+), with less organ damage and slightly enhanced immunological response. This treatment is certainly better than the methodology adopted by CETP, where the fish could survive only acute toxicity with higher organ damage.",

     "publication date": "12-2017",
     "abstract": "A novel process was developed to remove metallic anions from dilute aqueous solutions using polymer-surfactant aggregates (PSAs). This process uses a cationic surfactant to form micelle-like aggregates on oppositely charged polymer chains, thus forming PSAs. The PSAs can bind with dilute anions and self-flocculate. Subsequently, the anion-loaded PSA flocculates can be separated from the solution by gravity settling. The concentration of chemical residue, however, is relatively high in the treated water. To improve the quality of treated water and reduce the chemical usage, two different surfactants containing a 16-carbon chain have been investigated individually. The results show that an extended chain surfactant can decrease the concentration of chromate after treatment from 7\u00a0ppm (0.06\u00a0mM) to 0.5\u00a0ppm (0.004\u00a0mM) and the concentration of residual surfactant from 1\u00a0mM to 0.02\u00a0mM, using the same polymer. The PSAs formed with an extended chain surfactant work effectively at a salinity below 300\u00a0mM KCl and a temperature below 50\u00a0\u00b0C. These results suggest that the PSAs formed with a longer chain surfactant enhance the effectiveness of treating dilute metallic anions, and at the same time lead to much less surfactant residue in the treated water. Such a PSA process has potential application in the efficient removal of dilute metallic anions during process aqueous effluent treatment.",

     "abstract": "Phosphonate antiscalants are commonly used in membrane desalination to prevent fouling by mineral scale. In many circumstances, it is desirable to remove these compounds before concentrate disposal or further treatment. The goal of this research was to determine if the kinetics of phosphonate adsorption and desorption from granular ferric hydroxide (GFH) are sufficiently fast for GFH to be used in packed bed adsorption systems for antiscalant removal from membrane concentrate solutions. Well-stirred batch experiments were performed to investigate the adsorption kinetics of Permatreat 191\u00ae (PT191) and nitrilotri(methylphosphonic) acid (NTMP) onto GFH. Uptake of both compounds was slow and continued over the course of 6\u00a0days. Adsorption isotherms measured after 24\u00a0h elapsed showed initial concentration effects, whereby the isotherms were dependent on the initial adsorbate concentration in solution. This can be attributed to chemical adsorption reactions with faster rates of bond formation than bond breaking. Strong phosphonate adsorption in high pH solutions and high activation barriers for desorption resulted in slow kinetics for adsorbent regeneration by NaOH solutions. Desorption rates were bimodal, with 40\u201350% of the adsorbed phosphonate being released on a time scale of 10\u201324\u00a0h, while the remaining fraction was released approximately one order of magnitude more slowly. Complete regeneration could not be achieved, even after eluting the adsorbent columns with more than 300 bed volumes of 1.0\u00a0mol/L NaOH. The inability to regenerate the adsorbent in an efficient manner likely precludes its use for cost-effective antiscalant removal from membrane concentrate solutions.",

     "abstract": "This study compared the performance of a pilot-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) and a conventional anaerobic digester (AD) when treating raw mixed sludges from two water resource recovery facilities (WRRF). The study was carried out over a 2-year period and examined ambient (25\u00a0\u00b0C), mesophilic (35\u00a0\u00b0C) and thermophilic (55\u00a0\u00b0C) operations. Four operating conditions that spanned these temperature regimes and a range of loading conditions (0.5\u20132.5\u00a0kg\u00a0VS/m3\u00a0d) were assessed. The AnMBR consistently had greater volatile solids reduction (VSr) and increased methane yields (0.19\u20130.34\u00a0Nm3/kg VS fed) when compared to the AD. The VSr in the AnMBR was maintained at high values (49\u201364%) at an HRT of 7\u00a0days. An energy balance showed improved net energy production was realized using AnMBR over AD due to the higher methane yield (38% increase on average) and higher VSLR employed. The quality of the produced biosolids was assessed and it was found that the TS in the waste stream from the AnMBR were 2\u20133.4 times more concentrated than those of the AD because of the extended SRTs. The nutrient contents (N and P) of the digested sludges fell within the ranges typically reported. The results of this study extend previous work and are considered applicable to full-scale applications. Further the results suggest the potential benefit of a positive energy balance towards a sustainable practice when treating mixed municipal sludge using AnMBR at ambient and mesophilic operating conditions.",

Four types of chemical cleaning agents were selected for chemical in place cleaning of the fouled mullite membrane: Acid (sulfuric acid (H2SO4)), surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)), chelating agent (ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA)) and alkaline (sodium hydroxide (NaOH)). The fouled membranes were cleaned with single, binary and ternary solution of these chemical agents with the concentrations of 5\u00a0mM and 10\u00a0mM under the best operating conditions.

The combination of biological treatment with pretreatment processes like ozonation, electrocoagulation and adsorption proved to be a successful strategy for the removal of refractory organics as well as ammonium-nitrogen (N-NH4+). Ozonation led to a total organic carbon (TOC) removal of up to 12.5% whereas with electrocoagulation, up to 40% removal of TOC was observed. In combination with biological treatment, up to 90% TOC and 65% ammonium-nitrogen removals were observed during the experiments, all of which were performed in batch mode.",

The electrical energy-per-order (EEO) analysis of the system demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of the process for 1,4-dioxane removal with EEO values close to 0.8 kWh/m3/order. Further, 1,4-dioxane degradation rate decreased by 3%-13%, depending on the flow rate, when the raw water was spiked by a second micropollutant, atrazine, which competes for hydroxyl radicals. To provide an in-depth understanding of 1,4-dioxane removal, a mechanistic computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model was developed and validated experimentally. Sensitivity analysis of the operational variables underlined the significance of flow characteristics within the photoreactors as well as the natural organic matter (NOM) concentration of the water as the key factors controlling the degradation of 1,4-dioxane. The proposed model predicted the impact of the flow rates, OH scavenging of atrazine and water matrix (NOM and alkalinity) on 1,4-dioxane degradation with less than 2% average absolute deviation, demonstrating its potential as a viable tool for the design, optimization, and scale-up of 185 nm AOP systems.",

Volatile solid content and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of digested sludge and centrate showed inverse relationship with biosolid capture rate. Rheological parameters of digested sludge and centrate, such as yield stress and viscosity, were observed to change proportionally with total solid concentration, volatile solid content and COD. Therefore, the flow behaviour of digested sludge and its dewaterability can be substantially improved by increasing the reduction of total solid, volatile solid and COD by means of anaerobic digesters performance improvement. Key rheological parameters were derived based on rheological model which best represented the rheological flow behaviour of digested sludge, centrate and biosolid which were obtained from shear stress-rate and viscosity-shear rate rheograms of different models. Moreover, dilution of digested sludge or polymer by reclaimed effluent from the wastewater treatment plant was observed to reduce polymer consumption.

     "abstract": "Adsorption effectivity of a new composite with copper nanoparticles on polyamide support, PA-NCu in fixed bed columns was assessed to treat a continuous flow of water with arsenic, having previously determined the equilibrium parameters at a batch level. The experimental results allowed to calibrate and validate a transport model, which includes a retardation factor based on a Langmuir equilibrium and an additional As decay reaction. The retardation factor is dependent of the adsorption capacity of the PA-NCu and the As concentration, with greater incidence at the process beginning where the adsorption predominated and until breakthrough time, tending to decrease towards adsorbent saturation. The retardation increased significantly with the real adsorption capacity and less so with the decrease of the initial As concentration, which improved the composite\u2019s adsorption capacity when compared to a retardation based on a linear equilibrium. The decay reaction\u2019s effect is minimum during the initial stage but influences the saturation levels achieved. The model allowed to predict the effect of the adsorption capacity in columns as a function of the composite\u2019s characteristics and the initial As concentration, which allows us to infer that improving the support type and increasing the nanoparticles availability will advance towards its use in field applications.",

     "abstract": "A novel hybrid membrane-adsorption process has been developed for the production of clean water supplies. A 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm ceramic membrane has been functionalised to produce a super-hydrophilic surface on the microfiltration membrane capable of maintaining flux with little or no fouling under normal operating conditions. The adsorbent used is a supported epoxidised carbon nanotube material capable of removing heavy metals from solution. Both the membrane and the adsorbent can be easily cleaned when necessary using only a solution of readily available vinegar. The intended aim for this new water production system is for the production of clean water in remote locations, in disaster relief zones and for humanitarian purposes. Laboratory studies have shown that the membrane is capable of maintaining flux over a significant period of time and even when tested with an extreme foulant (used motor oil) performed admirably. The rejection properties of the membrane are as expected for small pore microfiltration, i.e. microbial contamination is easily removed. The adsorbent was shown to remove heavy metals (Cd, Hg, Ni, Co and Pb) to a very high degree (>99.3% in all cases) and was easily regenerated to almost complete adsorptive capacity. The hybrid-process was briefly deployed to the Rio Las Vacas (Guatemala) as part of a basic feasibility study and the unit performed as expected. No microbial contamination was detected in the permeate and the flux was maintained consistently at one third of the clean water flux. This demonstrates the system is capable of microbial removal and has good antifouling properties.",

At this OLR, the volumetric methane production would be 148,190\u00a0m3 per year when the digester will be operated at full scale level. The total amount of GHG emission reduction from factory is estimated in the range between 1500 and 3032\u00a0tons CO2-eq per year. Generally, the results of this study showed that ASBR is efficient on generating biogas and reducing green house gas emission while treating high strength wastewater such as tannery. Hence, a full scale ASBR should be developed and used to treat the wastewater generated in the tanning industries.",

     "abstract": "Planned potable water reuse can improve the reliability of water supplies by providing drinking water from wastewater. While the US government predicts near-term conflict over water in numerous small-to-medium-sized arid inland communities, knowledge gaps exist regarding the cost of potable reuse for this context, making it difficult for water managers to understand the feasibility of options. This research aims to inform decision-making about potable reuse in small-to-medium-sized arid inland communities by estimating the total present worth of several indirect and direct potable reuse treatment scenarios. We find that the present worth for indirect potable reuse that uses an aquifer as an environmental buffer is only slightly higher than for direct potable reuse that includes drinking water treatment; the present worth of both of these scenarios is higher than for direct potable reuse that does not include drinking water treatment due to the additional pumping and piping requirements. Further, scenarios including reverse osmosis for advanced treatment have significantly higher present worth values than those including ozone/biological activated carbon. All reuse scenarios considered cost far less than purchased water. Costs aside, any scenario must also be acceptable to regulators and the public and approvable from a water rights perspective.",

Fluoride removal characteristics were evaluated in a batch system with reference to changes in freezing temperature, initial concentration, freezing rate and total dissolved solids (TDS). Fluoride removal was found to be freeze temperature-dependent and the optimal temperature range was \u221215\u00a0\u00b0C to approximately \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C. Fluoride removal rate ranged from 50 to 75% for added dissolved substances to water and from 75 to 85% for deionized water spiked with fluoride, which gives a more satisfactory result. The decline of salinity was consistent with the decline of fluoride concentrations. However, from the perspective of fluoride removal rate, TDS played an inverse role in the fluoride removal efficiency. The removal efficiency by freeze concentration was finally validated using the high fluoride groundwater samples collected from 5 monitoring wells in the field, which showed a good correlation.

The sludge was chemically activated using different acids (HCl, HNO3, H2SO4, H3PO4), and its uranium uptake capacity from aqueous solution was checked after each activation process. The highest uptake capacity was obtained for sludge treated by phosphoric acid followed by washing with Na3PO4 (0.2\u00a0M). The effect of pH, point of zero charge pH pzc, uranyl ion concentration and adsorbent dose on adsorption processes were studied. The adsorption is high in the pH range of 3.5\u20137.2 with optimum value at pH 5.3. The point of zero charge was found to be at pH 3.95. The adsorption capacity increases with increasing uranyl ion concentration but decreases with increasing sludge dose.

Phosphorus rock is limited, predictions of experts vary between 60 and 300 years availability of mineral deposits. A high phosphorus level in water bodies leads to eutrophication which is not only harmful to aquatic ecosystems but can also be a hazard for humans. Sewage sludge in wastewater treatment plants acts as a phosphorus sink and hence represents a promising source for phosphorus recovery.This paper is a study on the influence of high salinity waters on the dissolved phosphorus content in the liquid phase of waste activated sludge. Next to the dissolution effectiveness as a function of the sodium chloride concentration, the influence of the salt dose on the dewaterability is investigated. It is demonstrated that it is possible to increase the phosphorus content in the liquid phase by high salinity. Furthermore the sludge structure is changed which is beneficial for dewatering processes. In fact, dosing of salt can enhance phosphorus recovery efficiently in cases in which brines or residual salt is available close by wastewater treatment facilities.",

It is a vital mineral nutrient, which acts as a co-factor for many enzymes and plays role in the maintenance of energy metabolism. According to WHO standards, the permissible limit of iron in drinking water is 0.3\u00a0mg/L. However, the dumping of domestic and industrial wastes in the water bodies is responsible for elevated levels of iron in the water. The continuous consumption of such water with high iron content may lead to various health problems. Bad odor, unpleasant taste, red color of water and stains on laundry and plumbing fixtures are also some of the issues related with high iron content in water. A variety of techniques have been adapted for the remediation of iron from different water sources. This review summarizes the different approaches used worldwide till date for the removal of high iron content from water. These methods have been classified into 4 different categories: conventional strategies, biological strategies, membrane technology-based strategies and nanotechnology-based strategies. The conventional strategies involve 11 different remediation techniques for removing iron from water, which have different iron removal efficiencies. The review also classifies the diverse types of iron available in water based on its mineral form, solubility and chemical nature.",

     "abstract": "Development of processes for the removal of sulfate ions from mine waters and industrial effluents is ongoing. A number of processes involve the removal of sulfate as ettringite, a calcium aluminum sulfate (Ca6Al2(SO4)3(OH)12\u00b726H2O) at elevated pH (11.5\u201313). Various process configurations have been proposed using lime in combination with an aluminiferous reagent to react with the sulfate in the effluent. This paper presents a study of the effect of the source of aluminum (when mixed with lime and synthetic sodium sulfate-rich effluent) on the physicochemical properties of the resultant ettringite sludge and on the propensity of the precipitate, when recycled, to form high density sludge (HDS). It is demonstrated that aluminum chloride, aluminum nitrate and polyaluminum chloride all remove sulfate as ettringite, with aluminum chloride removing sulfate to the lowest residual concentration. Sodium aluminate proved least effective at removal of sulfate for >1 cycle, and early process cycles produced a precipitate that may have been a mixture of minerals including ettringite and calcium aluminate monosulfate. Laboratory synthesised aluminum hydroxide and crystalline gibbsite were unreactive to sulfate. The different aluminiferous reagents influenced the resultant sludge volume and sludge settling velocity, with sodium aluminate forming a relatively voluminous sludge with low settling velocity and aluminum chloride-derived ettringite forming the densest \u2018single-pass\u2019 sludge and consistently the fastest settling sludge. Recycling of sludge in the process seemingly improves the precipitation kinetics, with lower residual sulfate concentrations found for the same reaction time upon sludge recycling. All sludges showed a slight propensity to form HDS upon recirculation. Microscope images show differences in the precipitate morphology between different aluminiferous reagents and upon recycling of sludge, typically there was an evolution from small spherical precipitates to increasing amounts of needle-shaped crystals upon recycling. These results highlight the importance of understanding how the choice of aluminiferous reagent influences the micro- and macroscopic properties of the resultant sludge, with the commensurate implications this has for process design when applying the ettringite precipitation process for the removal of sulfate from effluents.",

Photosynthetic bacteria have a high ability to remove heavy metals, dyes and macro-pollutants from wastewater. Production of photosynthetic bacterial biomass depends on temperature, light intensity and amount of nutrients in the environment. The yellow light is able to enhance the removal of chemical oxygen demand by photosynthetic bacteria.

The effect of two important operating parameters, including operating pressure (6\u201314\u00a0bar) and feed flow-rate (100\u2013250\u00a0L/h) on the permeate flux, flux decline, and also separation performances for biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total solids (TS) and total dissolved solids (TDS) were investigated for the TW30 membrane. The obtained results showed that the permeate stream obtained from a feed at a pressure of 12\u00a0bar and a flow rate of 250\u00a0L/h, through a single stage nanofiltration process have BOD, COD, TDS and TS of 85.6%, 85.8%, 97.3% and 98.8% lower than the initial wash water effluent, respectively.

The susceptibility of the eMBR to membrane fouling was assessed via the estimation of the temporal variations of K s i and specific cake resistance (\u03b1). These membrane fouling parameters and unit cost of treated water produced from the eMBR are being reported for the first time. The increasing order of K s i for individual measured contaminants was PO43\u2212-P\u00a0<\u00a0COD\u00a0<\u00a0NH4+-N\u00a0<\u00a0heavy metals.

The peak value of \u03b1 obtained was 33.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109\u00a0m/kg. This means that heavy metals were more permeable through the membrane than COD and nutrients and the specific cake filtration was much lower than the typical range. These results were also confirmed by a reduction in the rate of membrane fouling, as established by the peaks and troughs of the transmembrane pressure. With an operational life time of 15 years, the unit cost of treated water obtained was $0.86/m3.

The three sulfated and the three unsulfated polymers were used for congo red dye adsorption from water medium. Adsorption dynamics, adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherms of all the sulfated products were evaluated. Competitive dye removal characteristics of all the sulfated products were carried out in a mixture of congo red/methylene blue and congo red/malachite green solutions. The adsorption mechanism was studied theoretically by Density Function Theory (DFT), using Gaussian 09 programme. Sulfated products showed better dye adsorption properties than the unsulfated products where as among the sulfated products, sulfated amylopectin-g-polyacrylamide performed best.

     "abstract": "The removal of the ubiquitous phenol and phenolic compounds in industrial wastes is a critical environmental issue due to their harmful threats to wildlife and potential adverse human health effects. The removal of such compounds is therefore of significant importance in water treatment and reuse. In recent years, reverse osmosis (RO) has been successfully utilised in several industrial processes and wastewater treatment including phenol removal. In this paper, a new model based on a spiral-wound RO process is developed for the removal of phenol from wastewater. A simplified mathematical algorithm using an irreversible thermodynamic approach is developed. This results in a set of non-linear Differential and Algebraic Equations (DAEs), which are solved based on a number of optimised model parameters using a combined methodology of parameter estimation and experimental phenol-water data derived from the literature. The effects of several operational parameters on the performance (in terms of removal of phenol) of the process are explored using the model.",

     "abstract": "Reclamation of fracturing flowback and produced water associated with unconventional oil and gas resource development is becoming a more widely applied management practice because it protects freshwater resources through elimination of surface discharge and by reducing demand for high quality water sources. Reduction of organic matter has been a notable wastewater treatment challenge and has limited practical opportunities for reuse of these waste streams. This research focuses on harnessing the ability of microorganisms to biodegrade organic carbon present at high concentrations in flowback and produced water. Bench-scale and lab-scale biofiltration systems were investigated to determine adaptability of biofilms and measure biodegradation of organic carbon under different operating conditions. Microorganisms associated with biologically active carbon filters were initially acclimated to a produced water stream from the Piceance Basin. Following successful acclimation, the bench-scale system consistently achieved more than 90% dissolved organic carbon removal (Co\u00a0\u223c\u00a0240\u00a0mg/L). Similar performance was observed for the lab-scale system, demonstrating system scalability. After treating distinct wastewater feeds (produced water [Co\u00a0\u223c\u00a0350\u00a0mg/L] and flowback water [Co\u00a0\u223c\u00a02150\u00a0mg/L] from the Denver-Julesburg Basin), the system further demonstrated robustness and flexibility. Results from the performance evaluation validated the ability of the system to maintain treatment efficiency under variable operating conditions, including different pretreatment, aeration rates, temperatures, and empty-bed contact times.",

The addition of 0.5\u00a0ppm of lecithin together with the olive oil were found to be sufficient to remove halogenated and aromatic VOCs completely; however, the method was less efficient against ketones and esters due to their better water solubility and smaller molecular mass in comparison to other VOCs tested. The second method involved combining lecithin with vitamin E to produce an aqueous suspension of micelles that facilitated the removal of VOCs from water into the micelles, with the optimal ratio of lecithin to vitamin E found to be 82:18 w/w. The overall removal of VOCs from water using lecithin/vitamin E micelles was not as effective as lecithin/olive oil layers due to the problems faced when removing lecithin from the samples.",

Results indicated that the Bi3O4Cl/g-C3N4 showed higher activity than pure g-C3N4 or Bi3O4Cl. The optimal sample presents a degradation rate of 0.019\u00a0min\u22121, which is 1.9 and 3.8 times of Bi3O4Cl and g-C3N4, respectively.

It is found that the coupling of Bi3O4Cl on g-C3N4 slightly increased the BET surface area of the photocatalyst. However, the main reason for the enhanced photoactivity could be ascribed to the synergetic effect between Bi3O4Cl and g-C3N4 in separating electron and hole pairs.",

Conversely, IRC50 exhibited poor metals uptake for either metal. Higher concentration of EDTA than Pb(II) and Cu(II) significantly reduced the metal uptake capacity owing to the formation of metal-EDTA complexes (>97% at pH 5). However, higher concentrations (\u22652.5\u00a0mM) of water-borne cations such as Ca2+ and Na+ exhibited minor reduction (max 13%). FFA exhibited Langmuir capacities of 1.1 and 1.41 times than that of IR120 for Pb(II) and Cu(II), respectively.

It was proved that the presence of co-existing ions (Cu2+, Ni2+ and SO42\u2212) except PO43\u2212 in the solution had positive influence on the removal of Cr(VI). Due to the large accessible surface area and the protonated amino groups (-NH3+) on the particle surface, MgAC-nZVI could remove Cr(VI) through fast adsorption and efficient reduction. The removal of Cr(VI) by using MgAC-nZVI was proved to be in accordance with the pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetics. Based on the identification of the reduction products, Cr(VI) was reduced by Fe0 to form Cr(III). Eventually, the Cr(VI) was removed in a way of Cr(III)-Fe(III) co-precipitates adsorbed on the surface of MgAC-nZVI particles.

The regeneration of exhausted column bed was studied for three cycles of adsorption-desorption. The calculation of life factor suggested that the column bed can avoid the breakthrough time at t\u00a0=\u00a00 for 7.5 cycles whereas, the uptake capacity would be zero after 9.12 cycles of adsorption-desorption.",

A comparison among these techniques is undertaken with respect to the decrease of total organic carbon (TOC). Optimum operating conditions for each understudied process revealed the effect of the initial amounts of Fe(II) and hydrogen peroxide. Among the tested processes, the Photo Fenton process was found to be the most efficient with respect to TOC reduction of the wastewater within 50\u00a0min reaction time under low amounts of Fe(II) and hydrogen peroxide of 2.7 and 5\u00a0mmol/L respectively and amounted to 100% TOC removal for all the studied EDCs. Photo Fenton was followed by UV/H2O2, Fenton and UV only respectively in TOC removal.Paracetamol showed the highest removal followed by dibutyl phthalate (DBP) while, Bisphenol A came in the end. Scavenger experiment proved that the degradation takes place mainly through hydroxyl radical mechanism. As well, studying the toxicity of produced water showed that the treated water is non-toxic.",

Such composite flocculants are conveniently used in the flocculation process of small volume suspensions; i.e. the composite dry powdered flocculants are added directly to a suspension. However, very limited work has been reported on the flocculation behavior when composite flocculants are used in powder form. In this study, the effect of both dosages of dry powdered inorganic flocculant and ionic polymer flocculant on turbidity removal of PMMA suspension is investigated. Floc characteristics, such as sludge volume and floc strength, are also discussed. It is found that there exist various combinations of inorganic and polymer flocculant dosages resulting in sufficient turbidity removal; as the dosage of inorganic flocculant is increased, the suitable dosage of ionic polymer flocculant is also increased for better turbidity removal. Among these combinations of inorganic and polymer flocculant dosages, floc strength in higher dosages is larger than that in lower dosages. It is also found that in the higher polymer dosage conditions, flocculated sludge shows both local minimum and local maximum volume depending on dosage of inorganic flocculant. From these results, variations of polymer flocculant morphology under various inorganic flocculant dosages are discussed. A procedure for determining the optimum composition of a composite dry powdered flocculant for turbidity removal is proposed.",

Factors of redox mediators, organic carbon and steps of anaerobic treatment on the removals of amide pharmaceuticals were evaluated. For primidone, carbamazepine and crotamiton, their removals were poor during anaerobic treatment, and the addition of redox mediators enhanced their removals. For sulfamethoxazole, it was effectively removed by anaerobic treatment (above 90%) and the dosage of redox mediator accelerated its removal. The cooperation of carbon source and redox mediators accelerated the removals of amide pharmaceuticals, but the types of organic carbon had little influence on the anaerobic degradation of amide pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the hydrolysis/acidification step contributed significantly to the removal of amide pharmaceuticals during anaerobic treatment.

In this approach, the ion exchange resin Amberlite IRA 743 was first ground to a mean particle size of 40\u201360\u00a0\u03bcm to increase its kinetics. A ceramic microfiltration membrane was used to retain the ion exchange resin in the feed tank and the circulation loop while the model solution of boron was continuously added and the permeate collected for analysis. The effect of resin dosage, boron initial concentration, transmembrane pressure and membrane pore size was studied. A concentration below 0.3\u00a0mg/L was obtained during a long time at sufficient resin dosage. The results were analyzed in terms of volume treated at breakthrough and permeate flux. In particular, it was shown that the transmembrane pressure and membrane pore size increased the permeate flux, but also decreased the volume treated at breakthrough, probably due to insufficient residence time. Moreover, the ion exchange resin and the microfiltration membrane were efficiently regenerated with HCl (0.37%) followed by NaOH (1%) and reused. Overall, it is suggested that the hybrid process of ion exchange resin in batch and microfiltration may be a possible technique for boron removal.",

Of the various quaternary ammonium salts investigated as Cr(VI) carriers, methyl trioctyl ammonium bromide showed the best performance. A mixture of o-xylene and sunflower oil was chosen as the liquid membrane. o-Xylene has a high boiling point, low solubility in water and relatively high polarity which supports the dissociation of methyl trioctyl ammonium bromide. The addition of sunflower oil improves the retention of the carrier in the organic phase. After passing through the liquid membrane, Cr(VI) was reduced to Cr(III) by acidified iron(II) sulfate. The process was demonstrated with a continuously operating flow system with online monitoring via a dip-in photometer. With a Cr(VI) feed concentration of 1.6\u00a0mmol/L, the removal efficiency was sustained at >98% over 4\u00a0h.

In this study polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles were explored as sorbent in a hybrid system. Estrone adsorption capacity of 52\u00a0nm PS nanoparticles was found to be 79.6\u00a0ng/g at equilibrium estrone concentration of 5.9\u00a0ng/L. The performance of the hybrid PS nanoparticle-UF system was studied in terms of adsorption and membrane permeability under varying solution pH, particle size and particle concentration. The results indicated that neutral pH range is optimal for operation of the system and estrone removal with nanoparticles above 465\u00a0nm is negligible. The highest estrone removal (40%) was achieved by the hybrid system using a 100\u00a0kDa UF membrane and 84\u00a0mg/L PS (52\u00a0nm) nanoparticle concentration. The capacity of the system to remove estrone was found to be lower than most nanofiltration/reverse osmosis (NF/RO) systems but with a final permeability of 75\u00a0L/m2\u00a0h\u00a0bar, at least five times higher than most of the NF/RO systems.",

     "abstract": "The state-of-art is a mesophilic treatment of wastewater in paper mills without reuse due to the high water quality requirements. Thermophilic biological treatment could save a large amount of thermal energy, but the major obstacle of a reuse are the poor sludge settling properties under thermophile conditions, leading to insufficient water quality if conventional gravimetric phase separation is applied. MBR technology is a promising alternative which allows a recirculation of treated water for improving the water and energy footprint. So far, there is only limited experience with thermophilic MBR at the time. In this study, a thermophilic MBR with a submerged membrane (TSMBR) was operated to treat wastewater from a paper mill with a COD concentration of 25\u201330\u00a0g\u00a0L\u22121. The TSMBR was integrated into the operational process of the paper mill. Research questions were the influence of suspended solids, food to microorganism ratio (F/M ratio), cross-flow-aeration and filtration flux to the fouling of the membrane. Applying the critical flux concept, optimal operating conditions and costs for a future economic full-scale implementation could be derived.Key results are inter alia a sub-critical flux of below 10\u00a0L\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0h\u22121 is recommended for long-time durability of the membrane for minimizing the irreversible fouling and the permeability decrease. A chemical cleaning does not change the critical flux, but improves the permeability of the membrane significantly. The TSMBR suffered from increasing fouling at a cross-flow-aeration of below 0.6\u00a0m3\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0h\u22121 and a concentration of suspended solids of above 14\u00a0g\u00a0L\u22121. A stable process and cleaning could only be ensured by a F/M ratio of below 0.4\u00a0gCOD\u00a0gMLSS\u22121\u00a0d\u22121. Higher values result in an increased cake layer formation and intensive foaming.",

     "abstract": "Dissolved silica is ubiquitous in impaired waters, a fouling agent in desalination membranes, resistant to existing antiscalants, and difficult to remove from power plant feed waters, thereby inhibiting long term reuse of industrial water. Herein we report a systematic materials study of an inorganic anion exchanger, hydrotalcite (HTC, (Mg6Al2(OH)16(CO3)\u20224H2O)), for the highly selective removal of silica from aqueous solutions. HTCs exist in two different forms: crystalline uncalcined and calcined (550\u00a0\u00b0C) phases. Variables studied in ion-exchange studies include pH, HTC concentration, duration and selectivity with competing anions. Results indicate calcined HTC effectively removes silicate anion from different waters including simulated concentrated cooling tower water (CCTW), and waters with high concentration of competing ions, such as SO42\u2212 and Cl\u2212. The non-optimized HTC can be easily regenerated and recycled. Calcined HTC has a silica adsorption capacity of 45\u00a0mg SiO2/g HTC. The single path flow through (SPFT) studies indicate that using \u223c1.1\u00a0g/L calcined HTC effectively removes >90% of the dissolved silica from the CCTW. A pseudo-second order kinetic model was fit the experimental data of calcined HTC. Data is supported by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Thermogravimetric-Mass analyses (TGA-MS), Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD).",

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) appear to be well-established techniques for degradation of chlorophenols. In this research, TiO2 nanoparticles containing different amounts of cobalt, Co/TiO2, (as AOP photocatalysts) were synthesized by sol-gel method and characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM and DRS analysis. According to the XRD patterns, pure TiO2 and Co/TiO2 samples are in anatase phase. According to DRS results, the presence of cobalt in TiO2 lattice shifted the absorption edge to higher wavelengths (red shift) and Co/TiO2 exhibited the higher photocatalytic activity under visible light. The best degradation performance was achieved when TiO2 nanoparticles containing 1.34\u00a0mol% \u2212Co (Co/TiO2 (1.34)) was used as photocatalyst for 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) degradation under visible light irradiation. Photocatalytic mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) containing Co/TiO2 (1.34) were fabricated by phase inversion technique and the effect of these nanoparticles on separation, thermal and morphological properties of polymeric (here polyethersulfone (PES)) membranes was investigated by using FESEM, DSC and photocatalytic permeation experiments respectively. Permeation test results showed that addition of Co/TiO2 (1.34) to PES matrix can improve both flux and rejection percent of the resulting membrane. It was found that addition of 1\u00a0wt.% Co/TiO2 (1.34) to PES matrix can increase membrane flux and 2,4-DCP rejection percent (under visible light) by 53% and 25.3% respectively in which a nearly 2,4-DCP free solution is achievable in permeate site.

According to the nature of aerobic granular sludge, high settling velocities were expected in the GSBR and it was confirmed with 60\u00a0ml/g\u00a0VSS of 5-min sludge volume index (SVI5). However, the activated sludge required 30\u00a0min for the ASBR to achieve a SVI of 42\u00a0ml/g\u00a0VSS. Compared to the ASBR, the GSBR was also more efficient in nitrogen and carbon removal. During the steady period of the experiment, 99% of total ammonium nitrogen (TAN) was removed through nitritation and nitrification in the GSBR with an average influent TAN concentration of 498\u00a0mg/L. With high influent TAN concentration, the GSBR could achieve a full nitrification efficiency of 56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012% without accumulating nitrite. On the contrary, complete nitrification was not achieved in the ASBR as it was exposed to high concentrations of free ammonia (FA) and free nitrous acid (FNA), 16 and 0.2\u00a0mg/L respectively. Partial nitrification (nitritation) with the efficiency of 77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010% was observed in the ASBR. The GSBR also presented higher efficiency in denitrification compared to the ASBR. 23% denitrification was observed in the GSBR during the anaerobic phase. Moreover, higher chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was observed in GSBR than ASBR. Phosphorus removal efficiency was almost identical in both reactors. Overall, compared with the activated sludge, the aerobic granular sludge showed the best nutrients removal performance and higher tolerance to toxic compounds in young landfill leachate.",

The assessment of efficacy of the bed under varying experimental conditions of bed depth, flow rate and influent phosphate concentration revealed that, an increase in bed depth and initial phosphate concentration or a decrease in flow rate resulted in increased breakthrough and exhaustion time. Thomas, modified dose response (MDR) and Clark models were applied to simulate the experimental breakthrough curves following nonlinear regression analysis. Also bed depth service time (BDST) model was engaged to scale up the adsorption process by means of linear regression approach. All the models with a very high coefficient of correlation (R2\u00a0>\u00a00.93) predicted the breakthrough curves equally well. Good consistency was observed among experimental bed adsorption capacity (8.56\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121) and those predicted by Thomas (9.21\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121) and MDR models (8.81\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121).

Synthetic resins have potential application for the demineralization of coal seam (CS) water prior to beneficial reuse. However, there is limited data regarding the kinetic behaviour of strong acid cation (SAC) resin for the removal of sodium ions, the most prevalent ions in the water collected from coal seams (produced water) during natural gas extraction. In particular, exchange kinetics need to be understood in relation to estimating how full scale columns of resin may perform. Kinetic analysis revealed that the exchange of sodium ions from both sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate solutions with SAC resin reached equilibrium within minutes at ambient temperature. Optimal simulation of the kinetic data for both chloride and bicarbonate containing solutions was achieved by application of the Brouers, Weron and Sotolongo (BWS) fractal equation; and this should be used as the basis for development of an engineering model. The model parameters varied depending upon the ratio of resin to liquid employed in the tests, with rates showing substantial enhancement once an excess of resin exchange sites were present. The exchange process was apparently controlled in part by intraparticle diffusion, with three phases inferred for sodium chloride solutions and two for sodium bicarbonate solutions.

The degradation rate was found to be inversely proportional to the CV concentration and mesh size of the catalyst. The degradation of the CV was found to take place via \u0307OH attack.",

     "abstract": "Ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) with well-controlled pore structures have recently attracted much attention because of their potential applications as adsorbents. The specific surface area and surface chemistry of OMCs have been considered as two of the most important factors that affect their adsorption capacity for organic compounds. The objectives of this study were to compare the adsorption capacities of OMCs for resorcinol removal by using different carbon precursors (acrylic acid, sucrose and glucose) and optimizing the pore structure by using boric acid as the pore expanding reagent via hard template method. Among the three carbon precursors, sucrose demonstrated the highest adsorption performance for resorcinol removal and hence, was selected as the carbon precursor to evaluate the effect of pore expanding reagent. The tailored pore sizes ranging from 4.7\u00a0nm to 11.0\u00a0nm were obtained by varying the ratio of boric acid to sucrose from 0 to 4. It was observed that OMC with boric acid to sucrose ratio of 2 yielded the highest adsorption capacity (64\u00a0mg/g). OMC structure was characterized by small angle X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), surface area and porosimetry analyzer, Fourier Transfer Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), elemental analysis, Boehm titration and adsorption study. The results suggested that the effect of specific surface area of OMC on resorcinol removal was more significant than that of the surface chemical properties.",

In this work, LDHs were prepared by microwave-hydrothermal method, characterized by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and applied for borate removal from a water solution. The results suggested that the LDHs prepared by microwave-hydrothermal method had the smallest particles size compared with other LDHs synthesized by urea and traditional hydrothermal method. Due to size reduction, the LDHs prepared by microwave-hydrothermal method had a higher borate sorption capacity. Based on the results of the XRD pattern and 11B-NMR, the sorption mechanism of M-LDH is discussed in the paper. Ion-exchange was the predominant mechanism of borate removal, but surface sorption likely accompanied this process. In addition, the data obtained for the sorption of the three types of LDHs fitted well with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir sorption isotherm with a high correlation coefficient. The sorption amount of borate by M-LDH was 2.16\u00a0mmol/g, which is higher than that absorbed by U-LDH and H-LDH. Furthermore, the co-existing anion, especially carbonate, plays a role in hindering the sorption.",

Removal of silica from these concentrate streams is desirable before brine concentration and crystallization. This research investigated removal of dissolved silica from simulated HERO concentrate solutions using electrocoagulation (EC) with mild steel anodes and chemical coagulation with FeCl3. At pH values of above 10, the mild steel anodes immediately passivated and were not able to deliver Fe2+ ions into the solution. This necessitated lowering the solution pH value via HCl or FeCl3 addition prior to EC. At pH values \u226410, iron dosing by EC was in agreement with that given by Faraday's law. The optimal initial pH value for operating the EC process was 8, which required addition of 17.8\u00a0mM HCl or 5.8\u00a0mM FeCl3. An EC iron dose of 4.0\u00a0mM resulted in 76\u201389% silica removal for solutions with initial pH values between 4 and 8. Higher dosing up to 9.3\u00a0mM increased silica removal by only 5%. Chemical coagulation was not as effective as EC, and was able to achieve a maximum removal of 64% with a 4.0\u00a0mM FeCl3 dose. Solution ionic strength had no measurable impact on silica removal by EC, but did affect final solution pH values and silica removal by chemical coagulation. For both EC and chemical coagulation, the initial pH value of solution had greater impact on silica removal than the iron dose.",

We present a laboratory study of a 10\u00a0L Gl-AnMBR equipped with an external tubular ultrafiltration membrane treating synthetic domestic wastewater at mesophilic (35\u00a0\u00b0C) conditions with a series of short-term (12\u201348\u00a0h) cold (15\u00a0\u00b0C) shocks applied prior to switching to psychrophilic (15\u00a0\u00b0C) conditions. The average COD removal under mesophilic conditions was as high as 94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02%, even during the temperature shocks. Under psychrophilic conditions, more than 80% of the influent COD accumulated in the reactor (compared to 39% under mesophilic conditions). The results suggest that an abrupt and short-term temperature decrease from 35 to 15\u00a0\u00b0C can largely be absorbed by our system with no negative effect on effluent quality.",

The adsorbent (AIAABC) in which ABC was impregnated in AlCl3/FeCl3 solution and treated at 400\u00a0\u00b0C showed higher fluoride uptake capacity. The samples obtained were characterized and tested in batch mode. Inorganic particles were dispersed on the surface of carbon as indicated by SEM images and EDS. The main elements found in AIAABC were carbon, oxygen, aluminium, iron, sodium, and sulfur. Fluoride was associated with the aluminium hydro(oxide) (AO) particles in the pore spaces of ABC after adsorption. Specific surface area (SSA) was reduced from 80.5 to 3.7\u00a0m2/g, when ABC was impregnated with AO, indicating that the AO particles might cover the surface or pore spaces found in ABC. Maximum adsorption occurred at pH range from 5 to 9. The adsorption data were well fitted to Langmuir isotherm model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 21.1\u00a0mg/g. The adsorption process obeyed a pseudo\u2013second\u2013order rate equation. The adsorbent was effectively regenerated (85.7%) by 0.1% NaOH. Due to its high adsorption capacity compared to commercially available aluminium hydroxide\u2013based adsorbents, AIAABC is a highly promising material for defluoridation of drinking water.",

The electrocoagulation process has been evaluated for the removal of suspended solids, total organic carbon (TOC) and scale (hardness) causing divalent cations, which, if untreated, can clog the gas well. Experiments were performed with actual shale gas wastewater (ASWW), synthetic shale gas wastewater prepared with low concentration of dissolved salts (SSWW \u2013 LDS) and synthetic shale gas wastewater prepared with a high concentration of dissolved salts (SSWW \u2013 HDS).EC is found to be effective for removing TOC and hardness from both the actual and synthetic shale gas wastewaters.

The EEM for removal of hardness for ASWW, SSWW \u2013 LDS and SSWW \u2013 HDS are 303, 104 and 25\u00a0kWh/kg respectively. The high conductivity of SSWW \u2013 HDS helps in achieving higher currents and hence the lower reported EEM values for SSWW \u2013 HDS. Also, under alkaline conditions, the performance of EC increases significantly. Combination of aeration with EC is also found to increase the performance of EC, especially for wastewater containing high concentrations of chloride ions.",

The flat sheet fabricated membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), water contact angle (WCA), membrane surface roughness measurements and mechanical strength. The membrane performance was investigated at subcritical operating conditions. Pure water and critical flux through the fabricated membranes were measured for better understanding of the filtration and antifouling properties in MBR. The results showed that the membrane with polymer composition of 85/15 (PC/TPU) presented better performance in activated sludge throughout critical flux than that of other prepared membranes. Therefore, different dosages of PVP were introduced in this composition to study the effect of the additive in novel blend membranes. Likewise, the results indicated that TPU played the role of pore formation agent during the NIPS process, and the mean pore size of the membranes were increased with the increment in TPU content, which led to higher water flux. Finally, SEM images showed that the sponge-like structure formation was intensified by addition of TPU in casting solution. However, the finger-like structure was found to increase with introduction of 0.5\u00a0wt.% PVP content into the casting solution.

     "abstract": "Hydraulic tracer studies for horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands require addition of a conservative chemical tracer to track the flow path of wastewater inside subsurface media. However since one would wish to use fully conservative tracers disposal problems of the wetland effluent are created. In this study the use of heat as a hydraulic tracer was explored. Heat is considered an environmentally friendly alternative to chemical tracers as the post-study wetland and effluent temperature equilibrates to ambient conditions. Nevertheless the non-conservative behaviour of heat creates a distorted response curve at the outlet from which the hydraulic performance indices cannot be easily computed. In this paper we were able to develop a mapping methodology accepting a heat tracer response curve as an input and is converted to a conservative chemical tracer response curve by establishing a mathematical relationship between heat and conservative solute hydrodynamic dispersion. The methodology was tested by conducting a dual heat-chemical tracer study on a laboratory-scale unplanted subsurface flow constructed wetland and the predicted chemical tracer response was compared with the actual experimental chemical tracer response data. The predicted response curve adequately matched the experimental response curve supported by the fact that there was a 5% and 6% relative difference in Peclet number and mean of the RTD respectively. The outcome of this study is that it is possible to use the proposed mapping methodology in conjunction with a heat tracer to quantify hydraulic behaviour of subsurface flow constructed wetlands without having to use a conservative chemical tracer.",

CMPs have attracted research attention owing to their porosity and \u03c0-conjugation which can easily be engineered for a wide range of applications. The synthesis of CMPs is relatively easily done through established pathways that include the Suzuki coupling, Sonogashira-Hagihara cross-coupling, Friedel-Crafts reactions, oxidative coupling, Ullmann reaction and the Yamamoto coupling. Post-synthetic functionalisation approaches have been used to obtain CMPs which have specific motifs suited for particular applications. Despite their potential, use of CMPs in removing EOPs from water has not received adequate research attention, and is therefore an area that needs research. This short communication highlights the challenges posed by EOPs, presents some of the possible porous materials that can be used for their removal, and proposes CMPs as suitable potential adsorbents.

     "abstract": "The objective of this study is the removal of soluble manganese Mn(II) from drinking water by aeration process in order to oxidize it into insoluble manganese dioxide MnO2 using a Split-Rectangular Airlift Reactor (SRAR). The description of the global hydrodynamics, liquid mixing and gas-liquid mass transfer properties of the SRAR were presented in previous works and were compared to data and correlations in the literature. The effects of operating conditions were investigated, including initial pH, Mn(II) concentrations and amount of MnO2 particles. The major findings are that the oxidation of Mn(II) corresponds to a kinetically-slow reaction that is strongly pH-dependent. The kinetic data show an autocatalytic behaviour due to the oxidation of Mn(II) on the MnO2 surface, which allows the conversion to go to completion. This behaviour is confirmed by the addition of MnO2 fine particles that increase drastically the reaction rate. At high initial Mn(IV) concentrations, the kinetic law was shown to be pseudo-first order in Mn(II), with an apparent kinetic constant depending on the initial amount of Mn(IV) compounds. This constant was fitted by a linear model as a function of Mn(IV) concentration. This model was shown to be in good agreement with experimental data. Comparing with other techniques, aeration is an efficient process because it gives us a removal efficiency of 90% in less than 40\u00a0min at pH 9.5 and initial soluble Mn(II) and insoluble Mn(IV) concentrations between 5 and 20 and 0\u2013500\u00a0mg/L, respectively, while avoiding the drawbacks of strong oxidizers and biological oxidation processes. A model able to predict quantitatively Mn removal as a function of pH, initial Mn(II) and initial Mn(IV) concentrations is also developed.",

Results suggest that the electrospun lignin nanofiber membranes offer approximately 10-times higher adsorption capacity, provide two-times faster adsorption kinetics, and six-times higher permeability than traditional activated carbon sources.

FI and \u03b2:\u03b1 are both correlated to the TOC reduction of the HFNF. Water hardness has a logarithmical correlation to the TOC reduction by the HFNF, plausibly due to moderation of the membrane surface. FI and \u03b2:\u03b1 have potential to predict the efficiency of the HFNF and conventional treatment processes, and could be used online to identify changes in the raw water which affects the process efficiency.",

     "abstract": "The performance of several chemical coagulants including ferric chloride, calcium lactate, magnesium hydroxide, aluminium chlorohydrate, and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (polyDADMAC) were investigated in removing colour of palm oil mill biogas plant wastewater (POMBPW). The results show that ferric chloride as a sole coagulant can achieve high colour removal of more than 80% without needed for pH adjustment, which indicates the effectiveness of the coagulant to treat palm oil mill biogas plant wastewater (POMBPW).However, dual coagulants i.e. ferric chloride-anionic polyacrylamide (APAM) shows better performance than ferric chloride-polyDADMAC in terms of colour removal, pH, with shorter sedimentation time. The addition of polymer to system not only reduces the ferric chloride dosage, but also increases the colour removal of more than 20%. Comparison between APAM and polyDADMAC as flocculant aids shows that APAM can achieve stable removal at wider pH range and lowest sedimentation time at 20\u00a0min while polyDADMAC was at one hour. Both dual coagulants were followed second order kinetic and APAM shows the highest rate over polyDADMAC i.e. 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125/PtCo.min and 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125/PtCo.min respectively.

Batch degradation experiments show that the catalytic degradation of MO could be remarkably improved by coupling with microwave irradiation. The initial pH value of MO solution exerted notable influence on the degradation reaction and the optimal degradation efficiency was obtained under neutral conditions. Radical scavenger measurements indicated that OH radicals could generate during the catalytic process even without adding oxidant.

The coagulation behaviour of the aluminium formate was compared to the behaviour of the commonly used polyaluminium chloride and aluminium sulphate. The effects of the coagulant type and dose and coagulation pH on the treatment efficiency were studied as well as the role of polyacrylamide coagulant aid. Floc separation was done using three different methods sedimentation, filtration and centrifugation. Their functionality was evaluated as part of the coagulation performance studies. Good purification results were obtained with all of the tested coagulants, the lowest residual turbidities achieved being 0.7 NTU with aluminium formate, 1.4 NTU with polyaluminium chloride and 0.7 NTU with aluminium sulphate. It was also observed that aluminium formate is as effective as commercial coagulants and is thus a potential novel coagulant chemical due to its less harmful and biodegradable counter anion. When using only aluminium coagulants, flocs were found to be too fine to be removed by sedimentation but they could be effectively removed by filtration or centrifugation. The use of polyacrylamide was found to be useful in the sense that it enables the separation of flocs by simple sedimentation because the floc size is significantly increased. In this study new knowledge about the coagulation behaviour of highly contaminated effluent from latex manufacturing was gained and aluminium formate was proved to be promising coagulant also in industrial effluent treatment.",

The composite was synthesized at 1:1 weight to weight ratio. The capacity of the composite to neutralize acidity and remove toxic chemical species from synthetic and field AMD was evaluated at optimized conditions. Interaction of the composite with AMD led to an increase in pH (pH\u00a0>\u00a011) and lowering of metal concentrations. The removal of chemical species was optimum at 20\u00a0min of equilibration and 1\u00a0g of dosage. The composite removed \u224899% (Al3+, Fe3+, and Mn2+) and \u224890% (SO42\u2212) from raw mine effluent. Adsorption kinetics fitted better to pseudo-second-order kinetic than pseudo-first-order kinetic hence confirming chemisorption. Adsorption data fitted better to Freundlich adsorption isotherm than Langmuir hence confirming multisite adsorption. Gibbs free energy model predicted that the reaction is spontaneous in nature for Al, Fe and sulphate except for Mn. Geochemical model indicated that Fe was removed as Fe(OH)3, goethite, and jarosite, Al as basaluminite, boehmite and jurbanite, Al(OH)3 and as gibbsite and diaspore. Al and Fe precipitated as iron (oxy)-hydroxides and aluminium (oxy)-hydroxides. Mn precipitated as rhodochrosite and manganite. Ca was removed as gypsum. Sulphate was removed as gypsum, and Fe, Al hydroxyl sulphate minerals. Mg was removed as brucite and dolomite.

The characterization study of CP has been carried out using SEM and XRF.

     "abstract": "Being plentiful and readily available in many parts of the world, brown coal is probably one of the most potential substitutes for activated carbon. Many reports include the brown coal drying stage prior to adsorption despite the fact that it may lead to coal shrinkage and reduction of its pore volume, thus diminishing its adsorption capacity. In this study, various types of raw (wet) brown coal were investigated as adsorbents for anionic and cationic dyes in aqueous solution. The adsorption capacities of these raw brown coals were compared with those of oven dried brown coals and also with activated carbon. It was found that raw brown coals exhibit high adsorption capacities for cationic dye, but very low capacities for anionic dyes, suggesting the involvement of a cation-exchange mechanism. Additionally, the cation exchange capacities correlate positively with its cation adsorption capacity highlighting the major role of strongly acidic groups in the adsorption process. Drying the brown coal significantly reduces its adsorption capacity for cationic dye, supporting the hypothesis of coal shrinkage and the consequent reduced pore volume upon drying. These findings suggest that raw (wet) brown coal may perform as well as activated carbon for the removal of positively charged species in aqueous solution. Regeneration of the used adsorbent may also not be necessary, since the used brown coal can be simply burnt as fuel or composted.",

The chemical structure, surface properties and morphology of modified chitosan beads were analysed using FTIR, SEM and zeta-potential techniques. Results revealed that the adsorption of the RB4 was more favored in acidic conditions (pH 4). After modification adsorption capacity of chitosan beads increased for 1.48 times. The maximum adsorption capacity of chitosan beads increased from 317.1\u00a0mg/g to 468.8\u00a0mg/g after modification. This increase was attributed to the increase in the positive charge of modified chitosan beads.

In such system, the photocatalytic membranes are constantly exposed to UV irradiation and the effects of UV irradiation on the structure and long-term stability of polymer membranes are still questionable, and therefore, it deserves to be investigated. This study focuses on the stability of the TiO2/PVDF dual layer hollow fiber (DLHF) membranes against photocatalytic reactions for photocatalytic-membrane process. 3\u00a0wt% of TiO2 nanoparticles loading in DLHF membranes was evaluated under 8\u00a0W UVA in 30 days. The membrane stability was characterized by observing the changes in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and tensile strength analysis. The results revealed that some differences in FTIR peaks between new membranes and used membranes were found, suggesting that UV irradiation has some effect on the stability of the TiO2/PVDF membrane for 30 days exposure. The tensile strength of used membrane showed a moderate decrease with increasing UV exposure time, resulting in negative impacts on the membrane overall stability. This work is particularly importance to evaluate the sustainability of polymeric membrane, which has considered as heart of photocatalytic membrane reactor for wastewater treatment process.",

Fe3O4/GO was then prepared by mixing both GO and Fe3O4 in the presence of ammonia hydroxide (NH4OH) according to co-precipitation method. A series of test, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were performed to characterize the produced Fe3O4/GO nano-hybrid. Mixed-matrix membrane was fabricated by casting the pre-mix PSf-Fe3O4/GO polymer solution mixture using phase inversion method. The performance of both neat PSf membrane and novel polysulfone-Fe3O4/GO mixed-matrix membrane were evaluated by measuring the membrane permeate flux and humic acid rejection. Experiment demonstrated that the novel polysulfone-Fe3O4/GO mixed-matrix membrane was having 3 times higher permeate flux than the neat PSf membrane despite the drop in humic acid rejection from 89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% to 84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02%.

Although neat membrane has very often been used in a model adapted to cross-flow ultrafiltration (UF), MMM with TiO2 embedment has not been studied before. The identification of fouling mechanisms was determined by four typical modes of Hermia's models and the combined blocking model. The combined blocking model, which involves both cake filtration and pore blocking, taking place at different stages of the membrane filtration process, shows the best correlation with the experimental data. It was shown that the fouling behaviour of the membrane is governed by the nature of the membrane, especially membrane surface roughness. The fine and well dispersed X500 NPs on membrane polymeric matrix were found to have a significant effect on membrane anti-fouling property with a reduced pore blocking parameter, lowest cake layer resistance, and membrane resistance of 0.3261, 2.6201\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106/m, and 10.2182\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106/m respectively.

The results, interpreted in terms of adsorption ratio (A/A0) yield severe HA adsorption at low pH and high initial HA solution concentration.

The improvements in the membrane attributes were studied under two categories viz. morphological and permeation. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to study the morphological properties of the prepared membranes. Presence and stability of the additive (mPEG) in the prepared membranes were confirmed by using the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Permeation studies of the prepared membranes were done in the form of pure water flux (PWF) and hydraulic permeability. Equilibrium water content (EWC) and water contact angle of the prepared membranes were calculated to analyze the increase in hydrophilicity of the prepared membranes. Antifouling studies on the prepared membranes were done by using bovine serum albumin (BSA) and humic acid (HA). The modified PVDF-co-HFP membranes have shown a 50% increase in the PWF with an increase in the molecular weight of mPEG from 550\u00a0Da to 5000\u00a0Da. The increase in hydrophilicity and antifouling nature leads to an increased EWC, from 36.17 to 62.62. The water contact angle also decreases from 71.32\u00b0 to 59.45\u00b0 with an increase in the molecular weight of mPEG. Antifouling study with BSA and HA further confirms the increased antifouling nature of the prepared membranes, due to the presence of mPEG in the membranes. The proof of the same is presented in the form of flux recovery ratio, which increases from 73.07 to 87.47. The prepared membranes have shown good rejection profiles for both BSA and HA at 95% and 99%, respectively.",

     "abstract": "The rapid rise in environmental awareness, tighter regulation, novel strategies to separate oils from industrial wastewater, polluted oceanic waters, and oil-spill mixtures, especially in the presence of surfactants have prompted the developments of novel membranes that are capable of separating oil from oily wastewater. Among numerous polymeric membranes, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane has been widely employed due to its outstanding properties. This review maps out the current trends and development as well as provides a perspective on potential outlook for advances in novel PVDF membrane for oil separation from oily wastewater. Despite the existing trends, there is still a challenge to produce membranes with low oil adhesive and anti-fouling properties, chemical resistance, high mechanical strength, high flux, high oil separation efficiency and long term stability during oily wastewater treatment. Fouling still remains a major dilemma restricting PVDF membranes towards their transition from laboratory to industrial scale application. To properly address this threat, there is need for researches into effective materials that can mitigate fouling phenomenon efficiently. In addition, a much stronger understanding of the basic properties of such materials will be required in order to find the relationship among the material properties, membrane morphology and the transport phenomena in the PVDF membrane. At the same time, the potential of novel non-solvent induced phase separation needs to be assessed as a comprehensive understanding between structure-surface properties and their performance for oily wastewater separation should be the backbone for future development and progress in PVDF membrane fabrication for oily wastewater treatment.",

     "abstract": "Addressing the lack of viable solutions for water treatment in small rural communities, this paper describes the test of a system for the removal of arsenic. The SuMeWa|SYSTEM (AUTARCON GmbH) disinfects water using in-line electrolysis for the production of chlorine. In order to remove arsenic this approach has been extended using chlorine as oxidant for the trivalent arsenic and bivalent iron. Following the adsorption of arsenic on the freshly precipitated iron(hydr)oxide, Greensand plus\u2122 is used for filtration of the co-precipitate. By using a manganese dioxide coated medium, gaps in the chlorine production can be bridged through the reduction of the MnO2, which is later regenerated when sufficient chlorine is available. The first pilot system was tested and evaluated during the period from April to July 2015 at a site in Germany, Niederfrauendorf, where high concentrations of arsenic had been found in groundwater. After adjustments to the initial set-up the system worked stable during the evaluation period at a flow rate of 60\u00a0L/h removing on average 96 % of arsenic and 99 % of iron from the groundwater. The system treated groundwater of mean concentrations of total arsenic of 300\u00a0\u03bcg/L (of which 79\u00a0\u03bcg/L were dissolved arsenic) and up to a maximum concentration of 990\u00a0\u03bcg/L and concentrations of iron of 7.1\u00a0mg/L. Arsenic was removed to concentrations of 11\u00a0\u03bcg/L (dissolved arsenic) and iron to concentrations of 0.04\u00a0mg/L. Increasing concentration of arsenic in the treated water when running the system without the electrolytic cell has proven that chlorine enhances the removal process through the fast oxidation of the trivalent arsenic compared to aeration. The mean concentration of chloride in the groundwater was 8\u00a0mg/L. This was sufficient for a mean chlorine production of 1.3\u00a0mg/L used for oxidation and disinfection.Generally the system proved to be robust and worked reliably once the components had been adjusted to the local groundwater quality.",

Adsorption reached equilibrium within 1\u00a0h and Kinetics study showed that the adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order rate model. Maximum arsenite removal efficiency was obtained when 2\u00a0g/L of PANi/PVA was added to the solution. The equilibrium adsorption data were well fitted to Langmuir isoterm model, and the maximum adsorption capacity of arsenite was 27.25\u00a0mg/g. Furthermore, arsenite oxidation led to 65% adsorption enhancement at the neutral aqueous system and also decreased the sensitivity of adsorption to pH.",

     "abstract": "Mercury exerts significant negative effects on human health and living creatures, and is a well-recognized harmful element. This study investigates the removal of trace amounts of mercury from contaminated effluents by forward osmosis (FO). The operating performances and mercury removal efficiencies of two inorganic salts (NaCl and MgCl2) with different valences are experimentally investigated under varying solution concentration, pH and temperature. The operating factors such as temperature and influent concentration significantly affect the water flux by changing the internal concentration polarization (ICP) and the osmotic pressure. This temperature effect on ICP occurs indirectly through solute diffusibility. High mercury rejection was achieved by 1\u00a0M draw solutions of NaCl (98.2%) and MgCl2 (99.9%). Furthermore, the process maintained over 98% mercury rejection when the operating recovery rate reached 50%. Remaining problems are severe mercury adsorption on the membrane surface and excessive mercury amounts transported to the draw solution.",

GO incorporation in the PVA membrane was observed to have a profound influence, as it helped achieve better thermal stability and higher tensile stress compared to pristine PVA membrane. The composite membranes were prone to swelling in presence of water. GO imparted better hydrophilicity of the composite membranes as displayed by a reasonably high degree of volumetric flux of water and separation factor.

None of the samples contained glauconite as a primary phase, in contrast to previous literature.

This study investigated the EBPR performance of a bacterial consortium in a fully aerobic continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) fed with synthetic wastewater containing molasses as the sole carbon source. Total phosphorus (TP) concentration in the feed was varied between 1.4 and 40\u00a0mg/L. The results showed that TP removal efficiency was over 90% up to 20\u00a0mg/L of influent TP concentration but decreased to 62% and 30% at 30 and 40\u00a0mg/L of influent TP concentrations, respectively. TP removal efficiency was affected more by its own concentration in the influent. COD and NH4+-N removal efficiencies largely remained unaffected by different TP concentrations. Further investigations showed that TP was transformed to intracellular storage of polyphosphate (poly-P) with single stage aerobic process. The primarily reason for TP removal was the synergistic activity among the individual strains of phosphate solubilizing and accumulating microbes. Based on tracer studies, dead space in CSTR was found to range from 1.5\u20132.5%. The flow pattern in the CSTR was classified as completely mixed.",

The average rejection for the NF90 membrane was observed to be 95, 98, 87, and 76% for SO4, As, F, and NO3, respectively, whereas the NF270 membrane rejected the said ions around 90, 94, 57, and 60%, respectively. The NF270 membrane delivered 1.5 times better flux than the NF90 membrane. The experimental results were successfully predicted by the multiple solute models. Membrane resistance, permeability coefficient and mass transfer coefficient were also established for each membrane. The gel layer thickness was determined to better understand the hydrodynamics and it validated the assumption of negligible fouling.",

The low cost tubular membrane ($0.5) with 0.309\u00a0\u03bcm pore size, 53% porosity and 5.93\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0m3/m2s\u00a0kPa water permeability was fabricated from natural clay materials by extrusion technique. The capability of the membrane for treating real dairy industry wastewater was tested in tangential mode of microfiltration operation at different applied pressure (207\u2013414\u00a0kPa) and cross flow rate (5.55\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u20132.22\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126\u00a0m3/s). An increase in applied pressure and cross flow rate on the microfiltration process resulted in a decrease in percentage removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD). The novel membrane achieved a maximum reduction in COD up to 91% (135\u00a0mg/L) in the permeate stream with a flux of 2.59\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126\u00a0m3/m2s, which is well within the permissible limit for wastewater discharge into the environment. These investigations affirmed the potential suitability of the membrane in dairy wastewater treatment to attain acceptable limit (<200\u00a0mg/L) of the permeate stream. Consequently, the membrane fouling mechanism was examined using conventional pore blocking models, viz. complete, standard, intermediate pore blocking and cake filtration model. The experimental results were well described by the cake filtration model. Additionally, the potential of the novel membrane was compared with other membranes reported in the literature for dairy wastewater treatment application.",

The presence of chloride electrolytes, e.g. NaCl and KCl, was crucial for the efficient electrolysis. The optimized pH for C-Ti electrode was pH 7. Beyond methylene blue, C-Ti electrode showed high decoloration performance for other dyes, such as congo red, acidic blue 92 and remazol brilliant blue R.

The obtained catalysts were characterized by high-resolution X-ray diffractometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, Brunauer Emmett-Teller and Barret-Joyner-Halenda methods and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The three prepared catalysts showed excellent photo-catalytic degradation activity under UV-irradiation towards 3-chlorphenol and 2,3-dichlorphenol. The photo-degradation followed the Langmuir-Hinshelwood L-H kinetic model with R2\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.962; however, the rate constant was strongly affected by the type of the catalyst and chlorophenols.

In the 1st stage, the gypsum formed from using CaCO3 showed higher crystal purity than those using traditional neutralizers such as CaO and Ca(OH)2, and the precipitates are recyclable due to the fact that carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted in neutralization could prevent gypsum from shielding the surface of the neutralizer. In the 2nd stage, Ca(OH)2 was used to get a pH of 11.9 for arsenic removal. CO32\u2212 shows little effect on arsenic removal rate and stability of precipitates. In the 3rd stage, Fe2(SO4)3 was utilized to further remove arsenic to make the its concentration below than 0.2\u00a0mg/L by adsorption at pH 9.0. Using this novel 3-stage processing, the gross weight of As-containing hazardous waste was sharply reduced to as high as 50%.

     "abstract": "Anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) process is considered to be a sustainable option for nitrogen removal. Application of this process, however, is limited by the availability of high strength nitrogen. In this study, an anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) biofilter to treat sewage was deployed at ambient temperatures (18\u201321.5\u00a0\u00b0C), and the corresponding microbial community was investigated. The ammonia and nitrite initial loading rates were 0.154\u00a0kgN/(m3\u00a0d) and 0.2\u00a0kgN/(m3\u00a0d), respectively. ANAMMOX bacteria were rapidly enriched within 25\u00a0days and achieved a sustainable increase in the nitrogen removal rate (NRR) for sewage treatment. A final NRR of 0.99\u00a0kg\u00a0N/(m3\u00a0d) was seen at the 80\u00a0day point. Observations that combined fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations confirmed that ANAMMOX bacteria were dominant in the cultivated biofilm, accounting for 39.5 (\u00b11.6)% of total bacteria. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and phylogenetic analysis identified five genera of bacteria: Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Nitrosomonas, Candidatus Brocadia fulgida and Ferruginibacter. Of these, Candidatus Brocadia fulgida was the functional ANAMMOX bacteria in the reactor. Candidatus Brocadia fulgida could survive comfortably in sewage, and co-existed with Nitrosomonas and denitrifying bacteria.",

These Fe@SiO2 microcapsules were then employed to remove Cr (VI) ion from water. On the basis of Langmuir isotherms model, the maximum Cr (VI) adsorption capacities were estimated to be ca. 1400 and 1300\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121 at 305 and 310\u00a0K, respectively. These values, to our knowledge, were much higher than those in previous reports for many other Fe-based adsorbents. Besides, the initial Cr (VI) adsorption rate was calculated to be ca. 19\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121\u00a0min\u22121 that was significantly higher than those reported in previous literatures, and hence improving the adsorptive efficiency of Fe@SiO2 microcapsules in practical water treatment. Thermodynamic analyses of enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy further evidenced that these outstanding kinetics and equilibrium results were mainly due to a physical adsorption process, accompanied by a chemisorption associated with the reduction of Cr (VI) to Cr (III). The gram-grade Cr (VI) adsorption capacities and easy magnetic separation are highly desirable for their widespread potential applications in water treatment.",

The prediction of oxygen transfer using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is crucial for minimizing the energy consumption of the aeration tank, which is one of the highest energy consuming units in a wastewater treatment system. Bubble size (dB), which is a critical parameter in the CFD simulations, was investigated for different types of diffusers. CFD calculations were conducted to simulate the hydraulics in different aeration tanks and the calculated values of the volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient (KLa) were compared with experimentally measured data. A total of 19 tanks containing clean water and 8 tanks containing wastewater with different diffuser types and aeration intensities were simulated. The KLa values determined for these configurations were fitted using a calibrated dB value specified in the CFD simulations. The results of the calculations indicate that the coarse-bubble diffusers, fine-pore diffusers, and slitted membrane diffusers have bubble sizes of 7\u20138\u00a0mm, 5\u20136\u00a0mm, and approximately 3\u00a0mm, respectively.

The prepared catalyst samples presented uniform hexagonal pore structure in XRD, BET, and TEM characterization tests. The application of supported catalysts in the presence of ozone was found to be remarkably effective in elimination of oxalic acid in water with a conversion as high as 76\u201392%, compared to ozonation (10% removal), adsorption (20% removal), and catalytic ozonation using the support alone (56% removal). It was shown that the main portion of OA was degraded through reaction with hydroxyl radicals, which were generated by the application of the catalysts. In addition, the investigation of the activity of catalysts at various loadings of manganese and cerium oxides on the support showed that cerium oxide alone is a more effective than manganese oxide alone. However, the co-deposition of cerium oxide on a surface preloaded with fixed amount of manganese oxides led to mutual interactions, affecting the activity of the catalysts. At fixed loading of manganese oxides, the rate of degradation of oxalic acid was found to be much higher in the absence of any cerium oxide on the surface than high cerium oxide concentration. At optimum metal oxides proportions, the highest total organic carbon removal (90.3%) was achieved.",

The ECT in batch mode is conducted in a 1.5\u00a0L cubical shape electrocoagulation reactor using four-plate configurations. A current density of 89.3\u00a0A/m2 and pH 3.5 is found to be optimal, providing a maximum chemical oxygen demand (COD) and colour removal of 80% and 65%, respectively. At pH 3.5 electrode loss was 3.667\u00a0mg/L and power consumption was 11.42\u00a0WH/L. It is noted that treated slurry at pH 8 has shown best settling characteristic, which decreases with decrease in pH.

Clarification method by using composite flocculants in powder form has been proposed in the literature. Such composite flocculants are conveniently used in the flocculation process of small volume suspensions. In this study, fundamental aspects of the clarification mechanism of the composite dry powdered flocculant are investigated. 1.00\u00a0mg/mL suspension of polymethyl methacrylate particle (PMMA, 0.15\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter) is used as a colloidal material. A model composite flocculant comprising an inorganic flocculant (aluminum sulfate), anionic polymer flocculant (copolymer of acrylic acid and acrylic amide), and a flocculation aid (calcium carbonate) is studied. The effects of each component on turbidity removal are examined. It is clarified that the order of addition, the state of polymer flocculant (powdered form or liquid form), and combination of components (polymer flocculant with/without aid particles) are critical for turbidity removal with combined use of flocculation aid, inorganic flocculant and polymer flocculant. When the composite dry powdered flocculant is added to a colloidal suspension, the inorganic flocculant dissolves immediately. The polymer flocculant particles disperse well in the suspension with the help of flocculation aid particles and dissolve moderately. The ions from inorganic flocculant result in formation of microflocs composed of both PMMA and flocculation aid particles. Flocculation aid particles play an important role; i.e. they accelerate flocculation of PMMA particles and attenuate the ability of the polymer flocculant particles to produce undissolved lumps.",

     "abstract": "Coal seam gas exploration has resulted in the production of large volumes of associated water which contains dissolved salts dominated by sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate. Ion exchange using synthetic resins has been proposed as a method for desalination of coal seam water to make it suitable for various beneficial reuse options. This study investigated the behaviour of solutions of sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate with respect to exchange with Lanxess S108H strong acid cation (SAC) resin. Equilibrium isotherms were created for solutions of NaCl and NaHCO3 and an actual sample of coal seam water from the Surat Basin in southern Queensland. The exchange of sodium ions arising from sodium bicarbonate was found to be considerably more favourable than exchange of sodium ions from sodium chloride solutions. This latter behaviour was attributed to the secondary decomposition of bicarbonate species under acidic conditions which resulted in the evolution of carbon dioxide and formation of water. The isotherm profiles could not be satisfactorily fitted by a single isotherm model such as the Langmuir expression. Instead, two Langmuir equations had to be simultaneously applied in order to fit the sections of the isotherm attributable to sodium ion exchange from sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride. The shape of the isotherm profile was dependent upon the ratio of sodium chloride to sodium bicarbonate in solution and there was a high degree of correlation between simulated and actual coal seam water solutions.",

The degradation kinetics rate, effect of iron (Fe)-based materials dosage, chloride ion (Cl\u2212) mass balance and degradation products are investigated. The results show that iron (Fe)-based materials successfully degrade OCPs in water. After 12\u00a0h reaction, the degradation of \u03b3-HCH, p,p\u2032-DDT and aldrin at the initial concentration of 0.001\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 in water were found to be 100%, 81%, and 79%, respectively. Degradation rate order from the highest is \u03b3-HCH, followed p,p\u2032-DDT, and aldrin which related to their physicochemical properties. The degradation rate decreased with the increasing initial concentration of OCPs from 0.00005\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 to 10\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 in water. Increasing the amount of iron (Fe)-based materials clearly improves the degradation rate. Moreover, increasing free chloride ion (Cl\u2212) for elapsed time suggests that OCPs are degraded into lower molecular compounds through dechlorination process. In addition, several degradation products of p,p\u2032-DDT are detected, and degradation pathways are proposed, however, degradation products of \u03b3-HCH and aldrin could not be identified in this study.",

     "abstract": "Present study evaluated the efficiency of pulsed power technique (PPT) for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) under different operating and environmental conditions. Various reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide, ozone and superoxide radical were quantified. The maximum concentrations generated were found to be 63\u00a0mg/L, 28\u00a0mg/L, 1\u00a0mg/L and 18\u00a0mg/L for hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide, ozone and superoxide radical, respectively for 12\u00a0min of pulsed streamer discharge at 23\u00a0kV applied voltage and 25\u00a0Hz frequency. It was observed that magnitude of applied voltage, frequency (pulses/sec), pH, alkalinity and natural organic matter (NOM) present in the water had a significant effect on hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide generation. MB degradation efficiency and ROS formation increased with applied voltage and frequency. An initial MB concentration of 50\u00a0mg/L was completely degraded within 10\u00a0min at 23\u00a0kV input voltage and 25\u00a0Hz frequency. Acidic pH favoured ROS formation whereas high alkalinity and NOM reduced the MB degradation efficiency and ROS formation. Treatment time for the 100% degradation of 10\u00a0mg/L of MB was increased from 6\u00a0min to 8\u00a0min in presence of 150\u00a0mg/L of alkalinity. The MB degradation efficiency was further decreased to 95.6% when alkalinity was increased to 300\u00a0mg/L for 10\u00a0min streamer discharge. Mineralization of dye during treatment was confirmed by total organic carbon and inorganic ions analyses and IR spectra. Energy efficiency of ROS formation in the reactor was also evaluated.",

Biosorption was carried out by using exhausted coffee which has proved to be an efficient low cost sorbent for metal ions and reducing agent of hexavalent chromium in our previous works. After biosorption Cr(VI) concentration in the effluent met the wastewater treatment plant discharge regulation limit for hexavalent chromium (0.5\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121). The addition of a suitable concentration of coagulant/flocculant resulted in the precipitation of residual trivalent chromium and other metal ions. The high correlation coefficients between Cr(VI) and Cr(III) and conductivity and pH values measured during the biosorption process highlighted the possible use of these two parameters to monitor the process. Indeed, these two parameters measured online resulted to be effective indicators of both process development and the end point of the process.The merits of the proposed treatment which are considered over other techniques are much lower electrical energy consumption; less amount of chemicals addition and the possibility of chromium recovery from the sorbent at a quite high level of purity. Moreover, biosorption is an eco-friendly process and implies the reuse of a product at the end of its useful life rather than being disposed in landfill.",

Various parameters like initial concentration (50\u2013300\u00a0mg/L), effect of contact time, adsorbent dose (0.1\u20130.5 gm/50\u00a0mL), and pH (2\u20139) were studied at constant temperature. Equilibrium time for the adsorption process was found to be 2\u00a0h. Adsorption percentage of dye increased with an increase in the adsorbent dose and amount of adsorption increased with an increase in initial dye concentration. Initial pH in the basic region exhibited better results as compared to acidic pH. Langmuir adsorption isotherm fitted better than Temkin followed by Freundlich and Dubinin-Raduskevich adsorption isotherms. Monolayer adsorption capacity was found to be 105\u00a0mg/g which is comparable to other reported adsorbents. Adsorption followed Lagergren pseudo second order kinetics model better than Lagergren pseudo first order and Elovich models. Adsorption studies conducted at different temperatures (301\u2013313\u00a0K) indicated rise in adsorption with the increase in temperature.

The adsorption experiments were carried out in batch mode to optimize various parameters viz., contact time, pH, adsorbent dose, co-ions and temperature that influence the adsorption rate. Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich adsorption isotherm models were applied to describe isotherm constants. Equilibrium data agreed well with the Langmuir isotherm model with maximum adsorption capacity of 176.7\u00a0mg/g. Thermodynamic studies revealed that the nature of adsorption is spontaneous and endothermic. The kinetic process demonstrates that the adsorption process follows pseudo-second-order and intra-particle diffusion models. The mechanism of Cr(VI) adsorption by Asp-PPy was governed by the ionic interaction between NH3+ of Asp and HCrO4\u2212 ions. Asp-PPy can be reused successfully for the removal of Cr(VI) four times without loss of its removal efficiency.

However, it is anticipated that there will be an increase in the demand on desalinated water supply due to increase in urban population and expansion of industrial and agriculture activities. This is expected to cause water shortages and a serious need for new water sources. There is a critical need to evaluate the efficacy of applying certain advanced technologies to improve the quality of Treated Sewage Effluent (TSE) for reuse in more applications in the industrial and agriculture sectors to reduce the demand on desalinated water. Treated sewage effluent (TSE) and wastewater have tremendous potential in supplementing the ever-growing water demand. It can be effectively recycled for both potable and non-potable purposes, provided it meets specific water quality requirement and type of application. Generation of treated wastewater is also cheaper and consumes lower energy when compared to desalinated water. Nevertheless, wastewater effluent contains a wide range of pathogens and other pollutants including chemicals of emerging concerns and heavy metals. Many studies have confirmed the abundance presence of pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in wastewater that could pose a severe threat to public health. Therefore, it is essential that wastewater effluents are adequately treated and monitored to ensure a safe supply and reuse of treated effluents.",

     "abstract": "This study compares the growth and structure of flocs from chemical coagulation (CC) and electrocoagulation (EC). Flocs were more compact and larger when using CC rather than EC (on average, scattering exponents were 2.60 versus 2.31, while floc sizes were 254 versus 144\u00a0\u03bcm), and in low rather than high salt (2.51 versus 2.40, 222 versus 181\u00a0\u03bcm). They were also more compact at final pH 8.3 rather than pH 6.0 (2.53 versus 2.38). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that CC and EC flocs were structurally distinct, suggesting that the former is better at aggregating. In low salt and at pH 8.3, flocs were more stable and likely required more collisions to form, producing denser structures. Compact flocs tend to be more resistant to breakage, allowing them to grow to larger sizes. The time required for a floc size distribution to stabilize depended strongly upon the interaction between method of dosing and final pH. The CC-pH 6.0 and EC-pH 8.3 cases stabilized fastest (averaging 8.0 and 7.8\u00a0min), as they were always in the appropriate pH range for iron precipitation. The CC-pH 8.3 cases were initially adjusted close to pH 9 to counter coagulant acidity, while the EC-pH 6.0 cases possibly suffered from localized acidity near the anode, making precipitation less successful.",

Magnesite tailings, which is the byproduct of magnesite mining, was used to remediate acid mine drainage (AMD) which is the byproduct of gold mining. This will go a long way in minimizing the use of virgin resources and thus fostering the process of sustainable development. AMD was reacted with magnesite tailings at an optimum equilibration time of 30\u00a0min and 1\u00a0g of magnesite tailings dosage. Contact of AMD with magnesite tailings led to an increase in pH (pH\u00a0>\u00a010) and a drastic reduction in inorganic contaminants (>99%), except for sulphate that achieved >80% for sulphate removal efficiency. Kinetic studies showed that \u00b7adsorption of chemical species by magnesite tailings fitted well to pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetics hence confirming chemisorption. Pore diffusion was also determined to be one of the principal mechanisms acting as a major rate governing step. pH Redox Equilibria (PHREEQC, in C language) geochemical modelling predicted that Fe removed as Fe(OH)3, goethite (FeOOH), and jarosite (KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6), Al as basaluminite (Al4(SO4)(OH)10\u00b75(H2O)), boehmite (\u03b3-AlO(OH)), jurbanite (AlSO4(OH)\u00b75H2O, and Al(OH)3 as gibbsite and diaspore. Al and Fe also precipitated as iron (oxy)-hydroxides and aluminium (oxy)-hydroxides. Mn precipitated as rhodochrosite (MnCO3) and manganite (MnOOH). Ca was removed as gypsum (CaSO4\u00b72H2O) and dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2). Sulphate was removed as gypsum and Fe, Al hydroxyl sulphate minerals. Mg was removed as brucite (Mg(OH)2) and dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2). This would explain the reduction in the chemical species contents in the treated water.

     "abstract": "Harmless disposal of coking wastewater (CWW) has become a tough issue due to its complexity, heterogeneity and toxicity. In order to improve contaminant removal efficiency, a novel treatment system, taking into accounts the compositions and toxic characteristics of CWW, was deliberately developed and applied in a full-scale coking wastewater treatment plant. This system integrated a physical/chemical pre-treatment, a biological treatment and a physical/chemical advanced treatment. The pre-treatment, including the degreasing and air floatation, contributed to a significant reduction of oil (removal efficiency\u00a0>\u00a085%). The bio-treatment was a pre-aeration/aerobic1/hydrolysis/aerobic2 fluidized bed process, which removed 84.1% free cyanide, 93.5% thiocyanate and 86.2% total phenols, indicating an efficient biological detoxification. The successful degreasing and detoxification was conductive to the high removal efficiencies of COD (98.6%) and NH3-N (95.4%). The removal efficiency of total nitrogen reached 90%. Furthermore, the removal efficiencies of 18 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were in the range of 80\u201399%, while the removal efficiencies of 5 benzene derivatives were in the range of 88\u201396%. The total concentrations of these trace toxic contaminants were maintained lower than 50\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121 in the final effluent. The overall cost of this system was equal to 9.67\u00a0RMB\u00a0m\u22123 (<2 US dollars) of CWW. The satisfactory performance of contaminants removal and the low cost implied that this integrated system was a feasible and reliable option for CWW treatment.",

Investigation was done in terms of permeation and rejection behaviour of fabricated membrane for crystal violet dye, with and without an anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate from aqueous media. Morphological study of the prepared membranes was done by field-emission scanning electron microscope, scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscopy. Whereas, contact angle, equilibrium water content, hydraulic resistance, porosity and ion exchange capacity were measured for finding the hydrophilicity (HPCT) of these membranes. The measurements of water contact angle provide evidence that the HPCT of PSn membrane increases by addition of the d-TA in the casting solution. This study shows that addition of d-TA in membrane results in enhanced pure water flux and rejection as well as higher permeation compared to ordinary PSn membrane.",

The better performance of the Fe\u2013Zn\u2013Mg\u2013Al hydrotalcite can be attributed to the Zn2+ ions. These react with S2\u2212 in the substrate to yield zinc sulfide and therefore prevent it from forming H2S by sulfate reducing bacteria, meanwhile reducing competition for methanogens to form methane. Calcined hydrotalcites neither stimulated nor inhibited the methane production which suggests that the enhancement of methane produced by the Fe\u2013Zn\u2013Mg\u2013Al hydrotalcite was related to the presence of Fe2+ and Zn2+ cations incorporated and immobilized in the layered sheet structure of the hydrotalcite.",

     "abstract": "The elevated organic content of high-strength wastewater makes aerobic treatment systems uneconomical. High-strength wastewaters are preferably treated anaerobically, thus providing a potential for energy generation while producing low surplus sludge. This paper provides an overview of high rate anaerobic digesters developed during the second half of the last century, focusing on anaerobic filter (AF), anaerobic fluidized-bed reactor (AFBR), and upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB), along with their applications in high-strength wastewater treatment. Despite the unique compact design of these systems that combines the treatment and clarification in one reactor, they fail to provide complete stabilization of high-strength wastewater. Further downstream treatment is usually required to meet effluent regulatory limits. Therefore, advanced hybrid systems such as membrane bioreactors (MBRs), combined and integrated anaerobic\u2013aerobic bioreactors are discussed in this review for their potential as effective treatment alternatives. The factors affecting the performance of these hybrid systems have been highlighted. MBRs provide excellent effluent quality with reduced footprint, but their major drawback is membrane fouling which increases maintenance and operating costs. Combined anaerobic and aerobic systems have been developed to provide a cost effective and efficient treatment for high-strength wastewater. Integrated anaerobic\u2013aerobic systems employing biogranulation can provide a promising high-strength wastewater treatment technology. However, the design and operation of the integrated granular bioreactors are still in the development phase with limited data in continuous flow regime and large-scale operation. Long-term granule stability and long start-up are other obstacles. Further research is needed to overcome these shortcomings.",

Humic acid (HA) solution containing Ca2+ was used as feed to investigate the effects of microwave irradiation and ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the MD process. The membrane surface and composition of the fouling layer was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersion spectrometry (EDS). Ca2+ affected the permeation flux by forming complex compounds with humic acids and resulted in coagulation on the membrane surface in a conventional MD process. Microwave irradiation effectively decreased the deposit on membrane surface by destabilizing complex compounds. Organic matter was photo-degraded by the microwave assisted photo-catalysis so that the membrane fouling was prevented. In the MPMD process, the flux remained nearly constant. After 45\u00a0h of operation with the continuously concentrated solution, the concentration of the solution in photocatalytic reactor was about 2.8 times than the initial and J/J0 equaled to 94.5%. In the end of MPMD process, J/J0 equaled to 98.5%. The conductivity of the distillate over the operation time was less than 4\u00a0\u03bcS\u00a0cm\u22121.

     "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the study of the equilibrium exchange of ammonium ions with two natural zeolite samples sourced in Australia from Castle Mountain Zeolites and Zeolite Australia. A range of sorption models including Langmuir Vageler, Competitive Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Dubinin Astakhov and Brouers\u2013Sotolongo were applied in order to gain an insight as to the exchange process. In contrast to most previous studies, non-linear regression was used in all instances to determine the best fit of the experimental data. Castle Mountain natural zeolite was found to exhibit higher ammonium capacity than Zeolite Australia material when in the freshly received state, and this behavior was related to the greater amount of sodium ions present relative to calcium ions on the zeolite exchange sites. The zeolite capacity for ammonium ions was also found to be dependent on the solution normality, with 35\u201360% increase in uptake noted when increasing the ammonium concentration from 250 to 1000\u00a0mg/L. The optimal fit of the equilibrium data was achieved by the Freundlich expression as confirmed by use of Akaikes Information Criteria. It was emphasized that the bottle-point method chosen influenced the isotherm profile in several ways, and could lead to misleading interpretation of experiments, especially if the constant zeolite mass approach was followed. Pre-treatment of natural zeolite with acid and subsequently sodium hydroxide promoted the uptake of ammonium species by at least 90%.

The appraisal of the performance efficiency of the CA\u2013DE, via equilibrium isotherm analysis showed that the monolayer sorption capacity of the CA\u2013DE was 18.22\u00a0mg/g and Freundlich isotherm equation gave better description of the defluoridation process. Variation in ionic strength, pH, anionic interference, organic load had minimal effects on the extent of aqua defluoridation by the CA\u2013DE.",

Additionally, the influence of initial dye concentration and liquid temperature on the extent of NBB sonolytic removal was investigated. It was found that the NBB degradation rate increased with increasing the initial substrate concentration in the range 3\u201315\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121. Significant enhancements in the NBB degradation rates were observed at high liquid temperatures: 96.5% of NBB was removed at 65\u00a0\u00b0C after 45\u00a0min of sonication while only 51% was reached at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. The presence of salts (NaCl or Na2SO4) has a beneficial effect on NBB degradation. The degradation rate of NBB in the presence of 0.5 and 1\u00a0M NaCl was 3\u20136 times higher than that obtained without salt. Interestingly, faster degradation rates of NBB were observed in complex matrices. The complete destruction of NBB required 40\u00a0min in seawater and 60\u00a0min in natural water instead of 210\u00a0min in distilled water. The addition of persulfate (PS) ions improved substantially the sonochemical degradation of NBB through the ultrasonic (US) generation of sulfate radical (SO4\u2013), which is more efficient toward the degradation of NBB. The system US/PS resulted in 100% NBB removal within only 60\u00a0min of ultrasonic treatment.",

On the other hand, the progress in the polymer science and engineering provides opportunities for development of membrane materials with advanced functionalities and superior characteristics that can effectively be employed for design and fabrication of high performance membranes. The present review provides an overview on the specifications of metal plating wastewater streams and the significance of the treatment by presenting possible strategies that can be employed for heavy metal removal.

Agriculture is the second highest sector for water consumption in the Gaza Strip, using more than 50% of water abstractions from the stressed polluted Gaza's coastal aquifer. This paper aims to present and evaluate two available wastewater post-treatment options which could be employed to reuse wastewater for agriculture in Gaza: sand filtration using a textured geo-membrane sand filter and the Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) system. This evaluation is based on applying hierarchy grey relational analysis and the comparison matrix through an environmental assessment for each option using a semi-empirical methodology that combines results from field tests and computer hydrological simulations. In addition, it is based on a social and economic and the operational aspects for the Gaza City Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and its infiltration basin. The evaluation factors for the two options are juxtaposed in a Comparison Matrix with associated weighted scores and pre-defined scales to quantify the evaluation process before using the hierarchy grey relational analysis. The results show that the operational costs and the environmental aspects are the main factors that affect the evaluation process for wastewater post-treatment options. The sand filtration (with textured geo-membrane) option is ranked higher than the SAT system for this particular case study with an overall integrated grey relational grade equal to 0.3276, compared to 0.2596 for the SAT system.",

     "abstract": "One of the main environmental concerns of today is the occurrence of arsenic in wastewater. Targeting a solution for this problem, several efforts have been made towards research and application of cost-effective and easily adaptable processes for removing arsenic. The potential of living cells of Bacillus arsenicus MTCC 4380 to biosorb both As(III) and As(V) was examined in batch experimentations targeting the treatment of wastewater with high concentrations. Optimum parameters for biosorption process were determined as a function of contact time and temperature. The equilibrium was achieved after about 90\u00a0min at 30\u00a0\u00b0C temperature. Non-linear regression analysis was done for determining the best-fit kinetic model based on three correlation coefficients and three error functions and also to predict the parameters involved in kinetic models. The results showed that both Brouers\u2013Weron\u2013Sototlongo models for both As(III) and As(V) were proficient to provide realistic explanation of biosorption kinetic. Applicability of mechanistic models in the current research showed that the rate controlling step in the biosorption of both As(III) and As(V) was film diffusion rather than intraparticle diffusion. The estimated thermodynamic parameters \u0394G\u00b0, \u0394H\u00b0 and \u0394S\u00b0 exposed that biosorption of both As(III) and As(V) was exothermic, spontaneous and feasible under studied conditions. The activation energy (Ea) estimated from Arrhenius equation specified the nature of biosorption being ion exchange type. The results acquired are very favorable and encourage the use of living cells in environmental applications.",

     "abstract": "This study critically assesses the fouling behavior in forward osmosis (FO) when operating with new generation of high permeability commercial thin film composite (TFC) FO membranes. Low fouling behavior, commonly accepted in FO with the membrane active layer facing the fouling feed solution (AL-FS), is demonstrated to be mainly the consequence of operating at a low permeation flux (typically lower than 10\u00a0L\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0h\u22121). A higher water flux is observed to lead to severe fouling when using high permeability novel TFC membranes. Advanced membrane surface characterisation and FO fouling experiments over a range of initial fluxes (5\u201317\u00a0L\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0h\u22121) demonstrate that the intense fouling behavior of high permeability TFC membranes is mainly connected to the initial flux, whereas membrane surface properties only play a minor role. Like for any membrane processes, it is demonstrated that a (so-called critical) flux can be defined in FO systems operated in AL-FS, above which stable operation cannot be maintained over an extended period of time. At higher flux, the fouling cake deposed on the active layer creates additional hydraulic resistance to filtration and consequently significant flux decline is observed over time. A typical anti-fouling strategy, such as high cross flow velocity cleaning, is not efficient to sustain high flux, but fouled membranes can be successfully cleaned using extended osmotic backwashing.",

     "abstract": "Potable water from several residential areas on the east coast of Malaysia was filtered using a polyethersulphone (PES) membrane to separate the coarse and fine iron-oxide particles inside the pipelines. The as-received samples consisted of a wide distribution of particle sizes, ranging from 5\u00a0\u03bcm to 400\u00a0nm. The concentration of fine iron-oxide particles inside a distribution system was extremely low. Hence, a specific method is necessary to concentrate and separate the fine particles from the coarse ones. To study the fine particles from the bulk, excess pressure was applied to the membrane filter so that the clogged particles were released into the permeate. A 100\u00a0kDa PES membrane was used to separate the particles, because the samples consisted of a wide molecular-weight cut-off range from 89\u00a0g/mol goethite (\u03b1-FeOOH) to 231\u00a0g/mol hematite (Fe2O3). After the filtration process, the size distribution of permeated particles reduced to 550\u2013400\u00a0nm. Through X-ray diffraction analysis, numerous polymorphs such as \u03b1-FeOOH, Fe3O4, Fe2O3 and maghemite were detected from the samples. The zeta potential value of the permeated particles changed from \u221218.5 to \u221213\u00a0mV, suggesting that the dispersity of permeated iron-oxide particles became unstable, but remained adequate for electrophoretic deposition (EPD). The fibrous carbon electrode used in the EPD process, could remove up to 87% of the permeated iron-oxide particles compared to solid carbon electrodes (<56%). A high-surface-area, porous electrode and a moderate applied voltage were preferred in order to minimise gas formation, reduce the electro-osmosis effect and increase the deposition efficiency.",

The enzyme concentration, temperature, power, duty cycle and speed of agitation which executed maximum extent of degradation were 0.025% (w/v), 50\u00a0\u00b0C, 100\u00a0W, 50% and 300\u00a0rpm, respectively. Under these optimized operating parameters, maximum extent of degradation achieved was 96%. Also, the kinetics parameters were investigated from the kinetic study.

Methane head space gas compositions averaged across all reactors exceeded 60% and total methane production rates approached the theoretical maximum per kilogram of chemical oxygen demand reduced. Aggressive consumption of volatile organic acids correlated linearly with an increase in pH from 5.86 in the mixing reactor to a value of 7.61 in the final effluent. Both soluble and total phosphorous and total nitrogen were relatively unaffected by the treatment. Active methanogenic microbial biofilm communities possessing high proportions of methanogens were established despite the presence of feed wastewater streams possessing significantly different populations of planktonic bacteria. In sum, these results indicate that biochar alone can support the rapid development of robust well balanced methanogenic microbial biofilms that effectively minimize the impact of influent microbial communities on the reactor microbial biofilm communities.",

In an effort to develop convenient and effective treatment technology for the removal of fluoroquinoline antibiotics ciprofloxacin (CIP) from aqueous solution, a dynamic adsorption experimental apparatus based on carbon nanofibers (CNFs) was built and the adsorption of CIP was quantitatively measured by in situ fluorescence (FL) for the first time. The experimental results show that the adsorption kinetics and isotherms match well with the pseudo-second-order model and the Langmuir model, respectively. The adsorption equilibrium accomplished within 4\u00a0h, which is much shorter than the adsorption of CIP on the other carbon materials reported before. The maximum adsorption capacity (qm) is 10.36\u00a0mg/g, which is similar to the qm of CIP adsorption on biocomposite fibers. The strong adsorption affinity exhibited by CNFs was ascribed to the contributions of \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 electron\u2013donor\u2013acceptor (EDA) interaction, hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction. The dynamic adsorption of CIP on CNFs provides a novel and effective approach for CIP removal, implying the potential practical application of CNFs in the field of water treatment.",

The membranes obtained using a laboratory electrodialysis system was involved in zinc ions removal from model wastewater system. The experiments were carried out using three concentrations of zinc ions: 500, 1000 and 1500\u00a0ppm, respectively; an applied voltage of 5, 10 and 20\u00a0V; flow rate: 13\u00a0mL/min; time for each experiment: 2\u00a0h. The removal ratio (R) and mass flow (J) of zinc ions and also water content (% wt.) were determined. Membranes were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results indicated that the membranes doped with fumed silica powder significantly influenced the zinc ions removal process from wastewater, this fact being proved by a strong enhancement of the removal ratio from 27.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.38% to 96.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11% and by the increase of the mass flow from 8.79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12\u00a0g/m2h to 92.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10\u00a0g/m2h.

Firstly, hydrophilic agents including amino (NH2), carboxyl (COOH) and sulfonic acid (SO3H) groups, as different hydrophilic groups, are synthesized via hydrolytic polycondensation and free radical polymerization, which were further steadily adhered to the surface of PTFE membrane by a facile physical entanglement method. Effect of hydrophilic groups on the membrane surface morphology, chemical composition, membrane characteristics and surface charge property was studied. Furthermore, filtration performance was evaluated using a bovine serum albumin (BSA) wastewater and ink as feed solutions in microfiltration. The results indicate that hydrophilic agents are firmly adhered to membrane surface due to a mechanical interlocking, which provides the excellent hydrophilicity and remits the hydrophobic interaction between the bare PTFE membrane and BSA protein molecules in microfiltration. In addition, membrane surface zeta potential alters after hydrophilic modification, leading to the stronger electrostatic repulsion between the bare PTFE membrane and BSA protein molecules. Therefore, antifouling property is finally enhanced by the synergistic effect between the ameliorative wettability and stronger electrostatic repulsion, which decreases the flux decay rate and improves the flux recovery. We hope such hydrophilic PTFE membrane modified by a simple physic entanglement method could be potentially useful in separation field.",

Both AMS and ACP inhibit the degradation of one another, the extent of inhibition being dependent on the relative concentration of one with respect to the other. H2O2 formed in the process acts as a reservoir of various Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) which can enhance the degradation. However, H2O2 also acts as a scavenger for the ROS leading to its own concurrent decomposition. The degradation of AMS follows first order kinetics. The degradation is slow in deaerated system thereby reconfirming the role of O2 in the photocatalytic process. The catalyst can be recycled at least three times repeatedly before there is reduction in activity. The study clearly shows that zinc oxide mediated solar photocatalysis can be used as an effective tool for the tertiary treatment of AMS contaminated water thus indicating its potential for achieving the twin objectives of solar energy harvesting and wastewater treatment.",

Currently two types of copper and silver ionisation systems are commercially available: (1) systems using separate high purity copper and silver electrodes and (2) systems using copper/silver alloys in various compositions. The aim of this study was to determine the dosing accuracy of these two distinguishable copper and silver ionisation systems. This study showed that both copper and silver can be dosed accurately, according to Faraday\u2019s law, with systems using separate high purity copper and silver electrodes as anodes. Systems with new copper/silver alloys (Alloys 70/30 and 90/10) as anodes can only dose copper in predictable quantities. With new copper/silver alloys, silver concentrations were under dosed (<20\u00a0\u03bcg/l\u00a0Ag; minimum silver target level at outlets specified to control Legionella in water distribution systems). This is most likely caused by a difference in the efficiency of the electrolysis process of copper and silver in alloys. Silver is more oxidation and corrosion resistant than copper (more noble). The dosed silver concentrations with copper/silver alloys remained below the minimum recommended concentration for effective Legionella abatement, making alloys unsuitable especially when dosing directly into the water supply.",

Models based on film theory were developed to predict concentration profiles of MB, dissolved ozone and gaseous ozone for the continuous ozonation process. Validation of the models with experimental data indicates that the proposed models can successfully predict the concentration profiles. Evaluation of the models also reveals that the fast kinetic regime assumption was applicable for the mass balance model of MB, however, as evidenced by the presence of dissolved ozone shortly after the reaction started, the intermediate rate assumption better represented the variations of ozone concentration both in liquid phase and in gas phase.",

The Ni2+, H2PO4\u2212 and NH4+ sorption properties of the prepared samples were investigated in separate batch experiments, employing initial analyte concentration of 10\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u22121. The steel converter slag samples calcined at 500\u00a0\u00b0C and 900\u00a0\u00b0C and the mixed sample (70% spent alumina catalyst and 30% steel converter slag) calcined at 1000\u00a0\u00b0C exhibited maximum ion sorption capacities of 3.56\u00a0mmol Ni2+ g\u22121, 3.28\u00a0mmol H2PO4\u2013 g\u22121 and 2.21\u00a0mmol NH4+ g\u22121, respectively. The principal mechanisms of Ni2+ sorption were the substitution of Ca2+ ions by Ni2+ ions, precipitation at high pH and sorption on Fe3O4 and SiO2 surfaces present in the samples. The H2PO4\u2212 sorption was due mainly to the formation of calcium phosphates and sorption on Fe2O3 and SiO2 surfaces, whereas the removal of NH4+ involved sorption on Al2O3 surfaces of the prepared samples. The results of the kinetics calculations showed that a second-order kinetic model offers a good fit for the present experimental data.

TiO2 nanoparticles are often deposited onto the surface of a support material to avoid the need for post-use removal of the nanoscale photocatalyst. Polymers have been shown to be suitable photocatalytic support materials, but solvent based methods for TiO2 deposition using hazardous organic solvents such as dichloromethane have negative and avoidable environmental repercussions. In this work, green chemistry principles have inspired a new approach to the formation of polymer\u2013TiO2 composite materials. An existing surfactant-mediated method for the fabrication of porous poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) membranes has been used to form a support material for the photocatalyst while replacing hazardous dichloromethane with the much more benign acetone. The deposition of TiO2 within the UV-transparent porous support material facilitates the construction of flow-through photocatalytic reactors for both aqueous and gas-phase applications. These systems were characterized by the photocatalytic degradation of aqueous methyl orange and gas phase carbon monoxide, electron microscopy, N2 adsorption/desorption surface area measurements, as well as long-term UV durability. The porous PMMA-TiO2 composites possess a methyl orange decolorization rate over 6 times higher than that of the non-porous composite reference materials with comparable TiO2 content. The porous materials reported here are more active, and have superior TiO2 retention than the non-porous benchmark materials, and thus provide a greener foundation for future photocatalytic applications.",

Unlike raw POME, AT-POME is the effluent that has been biologically treated to reduce mainly the organic compounds present in the effluent. The treated effluent however still demonstrates brownish by the time it is discharged to receiving water bodies. The samples treated by membranes were assessed with respect to two colour parameters, i.e. absorbance at 370\u00a0nm wavelength and ADMI value. Other parameters also considered were total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN). Results showed that nanofiltration membrane (NF270) always demonstrated greater colour removal efficiencies in comparison to ultrafiltration membranes (UF 10\u00a0kDa and UF 30kDa). The NF270 membrane achieved 97.4\u201397.9% colour removal compared to 72.4\u201375.4% and 48.1\u201350.5% shown by UF 10\u00a0kDa and UF 30\u00a0kDa, respectively. Further sample quality analyses revealed that NF membrane could achieve higher TOC and TN removal than those of UF membranes. Although NF membrane demonstrated excellent separation, its performance was compromised by low water flux (6.58\u00a0L/m2\u00a0h at 10\u00a0bar). Since the treated effluent is not targeted for reuse, employing UF 10\u00a0kDa membrane with reasonably good rejection rate coupled high water flux (9.66\u00a0L/m2\u00a0h at 5\u00a0bar) is considered good enough to meet the discharged requirements. Further investigations have shown that UF 10\u00a0kDa membrane is less susceptible to fouling when it is operated at low pressure and for the fouled membrane, chemical cleaning could be employed to retrieve water flux.",

Ball milled bentonite clay was mixed with simulated AMD at specific solid: liquid (S/L) ratios and equilibrated on a table shaker. Contact of AMD with bentonite clay led to an increase in pH and a significant reduction in concentrations of metal species. At constant agitation time of 30\u00a0min, the pH increased with the increase in dosage of bentonite clay. Removal of Mn2+, Al3+, and Fe3+ was greatest after 30\u00a0min of agitation.

Adsorption capacity for sulphate was >50%. Adsorption kinetics revealed that the suitable kinetic model describing data was pseudo-second-order hence confirming chemisorption.

Effect of common anions present in water like Cl\u2212, SO42\u2212 and HCO3\u2212 on the photocatalytic reduction of nitrate was investigated.

Bulk experiments were performed under real discharged effluent conditions (pH and conductivity) in order to verify the applicability of direct and mediated electrochemical oxidation by applying 2.5 and 5.0\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122. Results clearly showed that, a partial elimination of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was achieved, depending on applied current density. Using Pt/Ti, by applying 2.5 and 5.0\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, COD removal efficiencies of 25.2% and 30.49% were obtained. Under the same conditions, a minor COD removal was achieved by using BDD electrode.

These figures are in agreement with the polarization curves obtained, where it was possible to confirm that the concentration of halide in solution increases the importance of Cl2/oxy-chloro radicals system depending on the electrocatalytic material and this behavior plays an important role in relation with the oxygen evolution reaction, influencing on the efficiency of electrochemical approach adopted.",

     "abstract": "Ni\u2013Al layered double hydroxide (Ni\u2013Al LDH) and Co\u2013Al LDH were prepared using a coprecipitation method. Ni\u2013Al LDH and Co\u2013Al LDH were found to remove Cr(VI) from aqueous solution through anion exchange of Cr2O72\u2212 with Cl\u2212 intercalated in the interlayer of the LDHs. Ni\u2013Al LDH and Co\u2013Al LDH were both found to be superior to Mg\u2013Al LDH for removal of Cr(VI). This excellent behavior is attributed to the buffering effect of Ni\u2013Al LDH and Co\u2013Al LDH that results in a lower amount of OH\u2212 in solution and allows Cr2O72\u2212 to be more easily intercalated in the LDH interlayer. The Cr(VI) removal process was consistent with a Langmuir-type adsorption, indicating that the removal of Cr(VI) proceeded via chemical adsorption involving the anion exchange of Cr2O72\u2212 with intercalated Cl\u2212. The maximum adsorption and equilibrium adsorption constant values were 2.0\u00a0mmol\u00a0g\u22121 and 2.4, respectively, for Ni\u2013Al LDH, and 1.9\u00a0mmol\u00a0g\u22121 and 1.5, respectively, for Co\u2013Al LDH. The kinetics of Cr(VI) removal by Ni\u2013Al LDH and Co\u2013Al LDH were consistent with a pseudo-second-order reaction, and the rate-determining step for Cr(VI) removal was found to be the anion exchange.

The results showed that the hydrophilic modification of UF membrane contributed to the fouling control in bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria filtration. The antifouling ability of the membranes increased with increasing PEO content. The pure water flux could recover completely after filtering BSA and bacteria, respectively, for the membranes with 25.2% and 8.5% PEO content.

The membrane permeability of the PAN membrane unexpectedly increased after HA or SA filtration, while the flux recovery ratio of PEO-modified membranes decreased with increasing PEO content.

The adsorptive removal capability of activated carbon fibre declined with the prolonged oxidation duration. The removal efficiencies for both the dye and cyclic organics decreased with increasing solution pH.

The performance of three distinct systems, TiO2/ACC/UV, TiO2-P25/UV and UV (photolysis), in the oxidation of indigo carmine was studied utilizing liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC\u2013MS). The results indicated that whereas the TiO2-P25/UV and UV systems displayed degradation rates of roughly 60%, TiO2/ACC/UV is by far the most efficient system with removal rates of about 100%, after 350\u00a0min of exposure.

Stability of such asymmetric microporous structure and its effect on the filtration performance were carefully studied in consideration of stretching temperature, stretching ratio and wrapping tension. The results show that the highly asymmetric microporous structure was successfully fabricated owing to the interlocking of fibrils at the interface between the skin and inner layers. High stretching temperature, high wrapping tension and low stretching ratio for preparing the inner layer are positive to the stability of asymmetric structure. In addition, an unusual phenomenon that smaller pore can be fabricated at higher stretching ratio is revealed in preparation of the PTFE sheet membrane. Finally, CaCO3 particles are retained by the skin layer of the wHFM, which leads to the high flux and rejection due to the high porosity and bubble point, respectively.

     "abstract": "One strategy for reducing water demand is by matching water quality to water need, through increased use of treated greywater to replace potable water in non-potable applications. Greywater processing, using photo-oxidation over TiO2 films, results in catalytic activity, which can be either enhanced or inhibited by xenobiotic contaminants found within the greywater stream. Analysis of film pre-treatment and reaction conditions indicated that photoactivation was caused in part by contact of the films with water and in some instances by degradation products produced during the initial cycle of photodegradation. Using a model probe for photoactivity, degradation over such films exhibited pseudo-first order kinetics. However, after catalyst re-cycling, the kinetics deviated from first order, with the films becoming increasingly more photoactive. Aging of these films over a prolonged period of time did not alter film photocatalytic activity and prior exposure of the films to UV irradiation in water actually decreased subsequent photocatalytic activity of the films compared with the un-irradiated films. Some greywater components, such as polyethylene glycol, enhanced the photodegradation rate of the model probe in both the initial and subsequent cycles, whereas others, such as sodium stearate, were more complex; the initial photodegradation rate was initially inhibited but then enhanced over subsequent photocatalytic cycles. Ionic phosphate has a strong inhibitory effect under all conditions tested. The results indicate that even minor components, at concentrations typically found in household effluents, may have a critical effect on the photocatalytic activity of titania films during processing of greywater.",

Treatment of effluent from ASP caused significant flux reduction and increase in transmembrane pressure (TMP) in the MBR. For both internal and external membrane configurations, substantial increase in extra cellular polymeric substances (EPS) and suspended solids resulted in higher membrane fouling during the treatment of ASP effluent. VOC removal from ASP effluent by MBR was achieved only while adopting internal configuration mode. Effective treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater, with less impact on membrane performance and reduced VOC emission to the atmosphere, can be achieved by coupling SABF with MBR and adopting internal configuration mode.",

Experiments were carried out at four concentrations 5, 10, 15 and 20\u00a0mg/L of Cr(VI) and 10, 20, 30, and 40\u00a0mg/L of phenol in both single and binary mixtures of Cr(VI) and phenol, respectively. In a single component solution of Cr(VI) 99.00% removal was achieved at 5\u00a0mg/L in 16 days of operation while in case of single component solution of phenol 99.80% removal was achieved at 10\u00a0mg/L in 14 days. In a binary solution of Cr(VI) and phenol 99.00% removal of Cr(VI) was achieved at 5\u00a0mg/L of Cr(VI) and 10\u00a0mg/L of phenol in 7 days and 11 days of operation, respectively. It was observed that 99.00% removal of Cr(VI) was achieved in less time and also at higher concentration of Cr(VI) in the presence of phenol. The FTIR and EDX analysis was carried out to confirm the uptake of Cr(VI) and phenol. The uptake of Cr(VI) was found more in the presence of phenol which shows the synergistic effect for the removal of Cr(VI). It could be due to the fact that phenol was used as carbon or carbohydrate energy source by the plant at more stressed condition. In case of both single and binary solution, toxic effect was observed at 20\u00a0mg/L of Cr(VI).",

In order to evaluate their potential for this application, a series of CAms with a degree of cationic substitution (DSC) between 0.26 and 1.08 were prepared from sodium CMC, by cationization with 2,3-epoxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride. The flocculation ability of the CAms against the anionic dye Acid Red 13 (AR13) was found to strongly depend on the DSC as well as on the pH of the solution. The highest flocculation ability was observed at lower pH and higher DSC: a color removal as high as 99% was achieved at pH 3 using a CAm with the highest DSC. The kinetic analysis revealed that the flocculation of AR13 can be accurately fitted by a pseudo-second order kinetic model, which thus allows to predict the flocculation behavior of CAms under these conditions. Besides AR13, the ampholytes also showed high flocculation ability against Acid Red 9 and Acid Blue 13. The flocculation behavior of these anionic dyes followed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model, which revealed the maximum flocculation capacity of a CAm for these dyes. Moreover, the analysis of the flocculation isotherm data and the SEM observation of the formed flocs allowed to determine the flocculation mechanism.",

The optimum dosages of these PAMs did not completely depend on the FHG total suspended solid (TSS) content of 0.2\u20131.5\u00a0g/L. The amount of PAM absorbed on the FHG surface linearly increased with an increase in its dosage, and saturation adsorption did not occur at the tested PAM dosages. The rise in PAM dosage can increase the size of conditioned FHG flocs/aggregates, while can decrease their compactness. The conditioned FHG aggregates at the optimum M351 dosage exhibited a moderate size, the smoothest surface, and the least compact structure among the three types of PAM. Conditioning the raw FHG with the cationic PAM of WD4960 increased its positive charge and decreased its hydrophilicity and specific surface area (S). However, M351 or WDA110 conditioning only increased the negative surface charge and hydrophilicity and decreased the S value of the conditioned FHG. The osmotic pressure variations indicated that, as a hydrogel, the optimum WD4960-conditioned FHG had stronger potential to absorb water from outside than the M351 or WDA110-conditioned FHG. Compared with that in the raw FHG, the free water content (FWC) reduction in the M351- or WD4960-conditioned FHG contributed entirely to the increase in bound water content (BWC) and the water release outside the hydrogel.",

     "abstract": "Exploring novel biological strategies to mitigate membrane biofouling is of significant value in order to allow sustainable performance of membrane systems for water and wastewater treatment. Quorum sensing (QS) is a bacterial communication process that involves small diffusible signalling molecules, which activate the expression of myriad genes that control a diverse array of phenotypes such as bioluminescence, virulence, biofilm formation and sporulation. Since QS is often associated with biofilm formation, inhibition of QS should be a promising strategy to control membrane biofouling. Recently, a revolutionary application of bacterial QS has been as a novel strategy for the mitigation of biofouling in membrane systems. In this review an attempt is made to correlate membrane biofouling with QS activity. Moreover, recent trends in membrane biofouling control based on QS are presented and the mechanisms by which different agents mitigate membrane biofouling based on QS are discussed. The potential impact of QS-based methods of biofilm control is assessed. Lastly, brief conclusions and future research challenges in membrane biofouling control based on QS are highlighted.",

     "abstract": "An investigation of using the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique to deposit negatively charged fine iron oxide particles in tap water samples on a counter charge electrode (anode) was conducted. Characterizations of fine iron oxide particles in tap water from two different locations, i.e. commercial and residential areas, were identified. After centrifuging the tap water samples, a particle analyzer was used to analyze the particle sizes and zeta potential values. The average particle sizes for the supernatant region from the commercial and residential areas were 230\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.30 and 260\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.68\u00a0nm, respectively.

During the removal of fine iron oxide particles using the EPD technique, the direct current (DC) voltage was varied from 5 to 25\u00a0V at a constant electrode distance of 30\u00a0mm. By increasing the surface area of the electrode from the carbon plate (64.87\u00a0cm2/g) to the carbon fiber (679.35\u00a0cm2/g), a higher percentage of fine iron oxide particles deposition was obtained from the carbon fiber than the carbon plate electrode. Thus, the removal of fine iron oxide particles at 5\u00a0V was 96%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.42 and 58%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.17 for carbon fiber and carbon plate, respectively.

Despite being a well-known and widely applied treatment method to stabilize sludge before final disposal, the hydrodynamics and mass transport in the anaerobic digester have been less studied than those of other treatment units. This paper presents the preliminary results of a 3D numerical study, investigating the characteristics of sludge flow inside the Ontinyent Wastewater Treatment Plant anaerobic digester (Valencia, Spain). An approach based upon the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation was applied, and closure was obtained using the classical standard k\u2013\u03f5 model. In this particular case, a single-phase model was applied considering both Newtonian and Non Newtonian behavior for the sludge simulations. These single-phase preliminary results allowed the occurrence of dead zones to be identified as well as possible shortcuts inside the digester. The analysis was carried out considering the velocities and the flow patterns inside the digester as well as the sludge volume in the digester that had lower velocities than a determined settling velocity. The model was calibrated using available experimental pressure and temperature data. Finally, as well-mixed conditions are strongly desirable for effective anaerobic digestion, proposals to reduce the volume of dead zones are suggested and discussed.",

This problem could be addressed partially by collection, treatment and reuse of greywater.

Hence the present study investigates the treatment of greywater in a laboratory scale horizontal sub-surface flow constructed wetland planted with Axonopus compressus (Sw.) P. Beauv. \u2013 a common landscape plant. The experiment was conducted for a period of 50 days with change in wastewater every 10 days (1\u00a0run). During each run the wastewater was circulated using a peristaltic pump at an HRT of 7.8\u00a0h. The results show that CWs planted with A. compressus performed well in the treatment of greywater than the unplanted control with an average removal of 93% turbidity, 95% COD, 98% NO3\u2212\u2013N, 67% PO43\u2212\u2013P, and 95% of anionic surfactants. The plant also survived well with increase in biomass and number during the experiment and proved to be an efficient bioagent suitable for the treatment of greywater in CWs. The study further suggests that the use of commercially valuable ornamental plants in the CWs as bioagents will improve the aesthetic beauty, public acceptance and help to generate revenue apart from the major benefit of wastewater treatment.",

The variables affecting the adsorption capacity were systematically investigated, including pH, initial concentration, contact time, and desorption and reusability. The results indicate that the as-prepared adsorbent has fast adsorption kinetics and high adsorption capacity, in particular for Hg(II), with the equilibrium time of about 40\u00a0min and the maximum adsorption capacity of 1106.72\u00a0mg/g for Hg(II). Over the pH range studied, this granular hydrogel shows insignificant changes in the adsorption capacity for Hg(II), while some noticeable differences are visible for Pb(II). The adsorption process for Pb(II) and Hg(II) can be described using the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the equilibrium isotherm matches well with the Langmuir model. The reusability demonstrates that after five adsorption\u2013desorption cycle, a high adsorption capacity is still observed for Pb(II) and Hg(II), though a decreasing tendency is inevitable. Consequently, the as-prepared granular hydrogel can be recognized as an effective adsorbent for the removal and recovery of heavy metal ions, especially for Hg(II) from aqueous solution.",

     "abstract": "This study demonstrates the hexavalent uranium U(VI) adsorption capacity of innovative binary iron\u2013manganese oxy-hydroxides (FMHO) as compared with the corresponding capacity of the conventional iron oxy-hydroxides (FHO). The experimental results showed that the synthesis conditions strongly influence the adsorption efficiency of the materials. For both FMHO and FHO oxy-hydroxides, those prepared at synthesis pH 5.5, showed the highest adsorptive performance and therefore were selected as qualified materials for further evaluation at NSF water matrix. The maximum U(VI) uptake of qualified FMHO at 20\u00a0\u00b0C was 133\u00a0mg/g, achieved at pH values between 6 and 7. This value is 25% higher than the corresponding 106\u00a0mg/g of FHO. The improved U(VI) sorption efficiency of FMHO is mainly attributed to the higher specific surface area (261\u00a0m2/g) as compared to qualified FHO (155\u00a0m2/g). Kinetic studies showed that 95% of total uptake on FMHO was accomplished within 4\u00a0h and reached equilibrium within 8\u00a0h. The respective thermodynamic data indicated that U(VI) uptake onto both FMHO (\u0394\u03970\u00a0=\u00a013,2\u00a0kJ/mol) and FHO (\u0394\u03970\u00a0=\u00a010.3\u00a0kJ/mol) is physisorption of spontaneous and endothermic nature. Rapid small-scale column experiments showed that FMHO can successfully remove U(VI) to concentrations below the WHO recommended maximum permitted concentration in drinking water of 30\u00a0\u03bcg/L, achieving the adsorption capacity of 4\u00a0mg/g at 30\u00a0\u03bcg/L equilibrium concentration. This value is considered adequate given that higher loadings would cause handling, transportation and disposal issues due to uranium radioactivity.",

The spherical microcapsules with an average diameter of 196\u00a0\u03bcm were prepared through encapsulation of the extractant by in situ radical polymerization of divinylbenzene. The results for adsorption equilibrium of each metal were applied to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model to explain the experimental results. The extent of metal adsorbed on the microcapsules increased as the pH of the metal solution increased. In a binary system of gadolinium and dysprosium, only dysprosium was adsorbed on the microcapsules at pH 6.0; this shows that the separation of these metals can be achieved at pH 6.0. The adsorption rate of the metals was also measured, which indicated that the metal complex formation reaction and the diffusion of the metal complex through the pores of the microcapsules contributed to the overall adsorption process of the metals.",

     "abstract": "In recent years, adsorption has displayed promising and effective results as a treatment technology for water and wastewater by industries. In the process, a number of adsorbents have been synthesized and applied for the treatment of pollutants such as metals, dyes, pharmaceutical products in solutions. However, for adsorption to be unconditionally adopted by industries, a few obstacles such as high capital cost, difficult segregation of adsorbent from solution, and complex synthesis processes need to be addressed. The removal of suspend adsorbents in wastewater from a continuous flow system is a challenge which if addressed properly would enable us to recover the spent adsorbent efficiently. The spent adsorbents can then be regenerated and used again by the industries thereby leading to reduced capital investment. Therefore, studies have been carried out aiming at the incorporation of magnetism in such adsorbents to aid their removal from wastewater. This review aims to comprehensively list and discuss adsorbents which exhibit magnetic properties and their adsorption behaviour under diverse conditions. The literature survey presented in this paper renders evidence to the good potential of magnetic adsorbents to remove various pollutants from wastewater. However, the practical utility of such adsorbents needs to be explored before they can be commercially applied.",

Among them, the use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) anchored onto montmorillonite (MMT) and dispersed in a sodium alginate (ALG) polymeric matrix appears to be a good alternative. In this sense, the aim of this work was to prepare MMT\u2013ALG\u2013AgNPs hybrids and then characterize them using UV\u2013vis spectrophotometry, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, to develop a new bactericidal material for the disinfection of industrial wastewater intended for reuse. The results confirmed the presence of spherical AgNPs anchored onto MMT, which was dispersed in the ALG matrix. The evaluation of the bactericidal potential of the MMT\u2013ALG\u2013AgNPs hybrids was performed by the agar diffusion test using two microorganisms (E. coli and S. aureus). These tests showed the formation of a prominent zone of inhibition for both bacteria. The MMT\u2013ALG\u2013AgNPs hybrids were then used to disinfect industrial wastewater. The results indicated a reduction of up to 98.5% of the total coliforms. For comparison, the industrial wastewater was subjected to UV radiation, which is commonly used in the disinfection of water and wastewater. In this case, the removal of the total coliforms using the MMT\u2013ALG\u2013AgNPs hybrids was slightly higher when compared to the use of UV radiation. This result illustrates the potential of these materials for the disinfection of industrial wastewaters.",

The GO was prepared from graphite and characterized by FTIR, SEM and XRD. The mixed matrix membranes were prepared in three concentrations of 13, 15 and 17\u00a0wt% of PES polymer. Static contact angle of the membranes were decreased significantly with addition of the GO nanosheets caused to increasing of pure water flux and MWCO. Cross sectional SEM images showed that the finger-like pores for all of the GO embedded membranes were slightly wider than that of the unfilled PES membrane. Ultrafiltration performance and fouling resistance of the membranes were tested by filtration of activated sludge. With addition of GO nanoplates, fouling resistance ratio (FRR) of the nanocomposite membranes was improved. AFM images and FRR results presented that a membrane with smoother surface has greater fouling resistance ability. Based on antifouling and water flux results, the PES/GO membrane with 15\u00a0wt% of PES and GO content of 0.5\u00a0wt%, was selected as an optimal membrane and tested in MBR system. The MBR showed an increased capacity for removal of organic matter, both in terms of COD and BOD5 of milk processing wastewater. With increasing of MLSS concentration, flux of the membrane was increased due to a decrease in soluble microbial products and extracellular polymeric substance from the bacterial cells in the lower food to microorganism ratio (F/M).",

Reactive Yellow (RY 145), a bi-functional dye containing azo chromophore has been attempted in the presence of potassium persulfate (KPS) as an initiator in the presence of microwave irradiation.

Complete dye degradation was observed in 3600 and 280 s, respectively, using conventional and microwave heating at the original pH (5.8) of the dye solution with COD removal of 60 and 66.5%. Under optimized conditions, efficiency of H2O2 was also compared for degrading the dye. Pseudo-first-order kinetics with higher kinetic rate constant (0.0165 \u00d7 102\u00a0s\u22121) and maximum energy efficiency (67.6%) was achieved through microwave assisted KPS system.

The effect of addition of SO42\u2212 and CO32\u2212 anions to the dye solution has indicated that the former enhances the degradation, whereas the latter reduces it. The temperature study using Arrhenius equation indicated decrease in the activation energy for the microwave system along with 2.6 times higher frequency factor than that for conventional heating. Thus, the microwave radiation assisted KPS system has been found to be the most cost effective and environmentally benign for the dye degradation process.",

The experimental results reveal that nitrate-N removal efficiency of 92% for Al\u2013Fe (anode-cathode) and 80% for Fe\u2013Fe are achieved at a current density of 25 mAcm\u22122 and 180\u00a0min electrolysis time in 100\u00a0ppm of NaCl when the initial nitrate-N concentration is 100\u00a0ppm. However, during this process approximately 20\u00a0ppm of ammonia-N is also formed. Ammonia-N generated is significantly lower compared to the amount of nitrate-N removal. It can be attributed to the fact that nitrate ion can be removed by both electrocoagulation (EC) and electrochemical reduction (ER) processes simultaneously. Experiments using Al, Fe and Gr as cathodes as well as anodes indicate that the contribution of EC increases when dissolving anodes are used. Further confirmation of nitrate-N removal by EC pathway is obtained by quantitative estimation of nitrate present in the sludge. During EDN, pH of the solution also increases with ammonia generation.",

Fractionation of DOC was performed by high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), whereby DOC fractions are separated according to their molecular weight. Results demonstrated that the dominant fraction in the raw feed water was constituted by humic substances (HS) (28\u201354%), followed by the fractions building blocks (BB) and low molecular weight neutrals (LMWN) (20\u201325%). The fraction with highest molecular weight constituted by biopolymers (BP) was found in the range 4\u20138%. These fractions exhibited different treatability along the treatment units. High molecular weight compounds (fractions BP and HS) were more effectively removed by CT than low molecular weight compounds (fractions BB and LMWN), which were better removed by AT1 and AT2 than CT. Differences in DOC fractions removal were also observed between AT1 and AT2. The passage through AT1 led to a decrease of BP and HS during ozonation, in opposition to BB and LMWN, which were removed to a greater extent during GAC filtration.

The investigations were carried out in a hybrid reactor which combined simultaneous biodegradation of organic pollutants through microorganisms, membrane filtration through a submerged microfiltration (MF) membrane, and electrocoagulation process via application of electric field intermittently supplied. The theoretical investigations included mathematical modelling to determine the impact of the variations of process parameters such as current density (CD), hydraulic retention time (HRT), sludge retention time (SRT) and pore diameter of anode (dp) on the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS), and the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), and chromium (Cr) from raw municipal wastewater directly supplied from the main sewer (without pre or primary treatment) at Masdar City, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. CD was varied between 5 and 20\u00a0A/m2 with a step size of 10\u00a0A/m2; HRT was varied by changing the influent flow rate between 20 and 50\u00a0L/d with a step size of 10\u00a0L/d; SRT was changed from 5 to 20\u00a0d using a step size of 5\u00a0d; and dp was changed from 0.2 to 0.5\u00a0cm. It was observed from the theoretical results obtained that the removal of COD, TN, and TP from the wastewater was favored in the hybrid unit by increasing the CD or HRT and decreasing the porosity of anode.",

Design of such hybrid membranes requires an intrinsic understanding of adsorption behavior coupled with transport-based performance. In the present work, fouling of a polysulfone (PSF) membrane was examined, using adsorption isotherms, cross-flow flux declines and flux recovery ratios (FRRs). Fractional adsorption was characterized using fluorescence excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy. The foulants used were humic acids (HA) (Aldrich and Suwannee River) and bovine serum albumin (BSA). Adsorption of the HA was insignificant on colloidal PSF, as determined by isotherm data (regardless of addition of Ca2+, Na1+, 7 days of agitation or high adsorbent concentration). EEM spectra showed no evidence of fractional adsorption of Aldrich HA components. Pore blocking and low FRRs occurred on PSF membranes at 2\u00a0ppm concentration despite lack of adsorption. At 700\u00a0ppm HA, the flux decline and FRRs were high, consistent with the formation of HA micelles and subsequent cake formation. BSA exhibited fluxes and FRRs consistent with pore blocking, which are connected with adsorption in the isotherm studies. A new kinetic trapping mechanism is proposed to explain these observations. Here primary particles of HA diffuse through the membrane, re-aggregate, but then become trapped inside the pores where concentration is high and aggregation is preferred. Another model discussed as well is the classic filter-aid situation.",

The operating conditions of the reactor such as irradiation time, solution pH, and work pressure were investigated. Water quality and extent of fouling were measured, respectively, in terms of removal rate of water quality index and membrane flux decline. The results showed that the highest activity for congo red degradation was reached under pH 4 in about 90\u00a0min of irradiation time. In membrane separation, when pH 10, the decline of the UF membrane flux was slower. However, the decline of the RO membrane flux was slower when pH 4. Taking into accounts of the power savings and efficiency, 0.5\u00a0MPa was used as the work pressure of RO. Photocatalysis as a pre-treatment can reduce the membrane flux decline of UF and RO membrane by about 12% and 8%, respectively.

     "abstract": "Recent investigations have found zero-valent iron [Fe(0)] as promising material for removal of arsenic from groundwater. This study aimed at improving the arsenic removal efficiency of a household level filter unit containing iron filings and sand. A novel methodical approach was used to assess the aeration (oxygen transfer) capacity of the filter unit. The calculations suggest that the designed unit possessed sufficient capacity to oxidize ferrous ion to ferric ion and resulted in co-oxidation of arsenite (As3+) to arsenate (As5+). The modifications made to the system reduced the problems of clogging, excessive headloss development and enabled prolonged leaching of iron leading to better arsenic removal efficiency. Under laboratory conditions, the modified unit was able to treat simulated groundwater containing 500\u00a0\u03bcg/L of As3+, 2\u00a0mg/L of P, and 20\u00a0mg/L of Si to arsenic levels below WHO standard of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/L without adding any chemical oxidant. The Fe/As ratio of 88.46 was required to bring the arsenic concentrations below 10\u00a0\u03bcg/L which is much less than that are achieved by other researchers under similar conditions. The removal of arsenic by zero-valent iron [Fe(0)] is attributed to adsorption by iron hydroxides generated from the oxic corrosion of Fe(0) and/or precipitation of iron arsenate within the system. Results indicated that a filtration system consisting of iron filings and sand could be effectively used at household level to bring the total arsenic levels below WHO standard of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/L in drinking water.",

A novel composite red mud (RM)/polyaluminum chloride (PACl) coagulant (RMPACl) was prepared for effective removal of phosphate from aqueous solution. The RM obtained from alumina industrial waste was employed as an alternative alkali to adjust the basicity of the semi-product of polyaluminum chloride (ACl). The RMPACl was characterized by pH titration, Al(III) species distribution, TEM, XRD, FTIR, phosphate removal performance as well as flocs properties analysis. The results showed that RM can significantly enhance the basicity of ACl. The TEM and FTIR results indicated that RMPACl was composed of polymeric aluminum species and residual RM particles. In addition, the phosphate removal experiments demonstrated that the optimum dosage of RMPACl was 147.5\u00a0mg/l for the decontamination of phosphate with an initial concentration of 5\u00a0mg/l, which is much smaller than that of PACl. RMPACl with relatively smaller and porous flocs exhibited a faster settling time than PACl, because the additional RM played an important role in the phosphate removal. More importantly, the RMPACl performed better than PACl in the treatment of the synthetic and natural phosphate contaminated water. It is anticipated that RMPACl can be proposed as a cost-effective coagulant for the effective removal of phosphate from natural water.",

Most of the prepared aluminium formates were found to be at least equally effective as aluminium sulphate at optimum coagulation conditions. It was found that relatively small amounts of formic acid are adequate to obtain a well-functioning product. Removal efficiencies of obtained aluminium formates were found to be dependent on coagulation condition, namely coagulant dose and pH. In most conditions, aluminium formate had a similar coagulation efficiency to that of aluminium sulphate. Especially at low pH range, higher removal efficiencies were obtained with aluminium formate than with aluminium sulphate, whereas around pH 5 with high dosages aluminium sulphate was more effective. The prepared aluminium formate coagulants are potential alternatives to commonly used coagulants, especially in applications where chloride and sulphate are problematic due to corrosion or formation of precipitates.

Results were compared to those obtained from offline laboratory analysis for water quality indicators, such as suspended solids. The results showed that the activated sludge process has produced different levels of settling quality. Large and round flocs enabled good settling, whereas small and irregularly shaped flocs, as well as the large amount of filaments, led to poor settling. The image analysis results obtained from the on-line device indicated that the poor settling was most likely caused by filamentous bulking. Such bulking was most likely due to the compositional variations in incoming wastewater; the poorly settled sludge was characterised by much lower solids content, which could have been responsible for the growth of filamentous bacteria. The image analysis results also revealed that the changes in floc morphology occurred slowly, indicating the potential for optical monitoring to control and optimise the activated sludge process.",

Moreover, viscosity plays a role in terms of energy consumption (e.g. pumping and mixing). Therefore, an accurate viscosity relationship as a function of total suspended solids (TSS) and temperature can help to model the behavior of the AS. A total number of 10 municipal and 11 industrial MBR plants throughout Europe were investigated during the period 2007\u20132009 using the Delft Filtration Characterization method (DFCm). Unlike other literature studies, AS rheology was measured on site, exploiting the resemblance of the DFCm to a tubular rheometer and compared against the results of a rotational rheometer. A new rheological model for the viscosity of AS was developed maintaining the same mathematical structure as previous rheological models made for MBRs.

The second module serves as an As(V) adsorber and employs microfiltration membranes with iron oxide nanoparticles deposited in the pores. The synthesis of the membrane materials and the evaluation of the process in treating a feed stream containing 70\u00a0ppb As(III)\u00a0+\u00a0As(V) are described. As appeared from the results, complete removal of all arsenic species could be achieved. Membrane regeneration and removal capacity recovery could be achieved by a membrane heat treatment at 110\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h.",

     "abstract": "Recently, there is an emergence of endocrine-disrupting compounds, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (EDC/PPCPs) as important pollutants to remove from drinking water and reclaimed wastewater. In this work, the efficiency of removing pharmaceuticals (PCs) from model aqueous solutions and raw wastewater with ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), activated carbon adsorption (AC), biological methods (SBR) and oxidation with ClO2 was investigated. Some treatments have also been used as combined processes: UF\u00a0+\u00a0NF, UF\u00a0+\u00a0AC, SBR\u00a0+\u00a0ClO2. Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, Diclofenac, Sulfamethoxazole, Clonazepam, and Diazepam were selected as model compounds. In order to evaluate their removal, PC solutions were also considered at several operating conditions (pH, conductivity, concentration, and temperature), and optimal conditions were obtained. Experiments were performed at usual PC concentrations in wastewaters: 1000\u00a0ng/L for Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen, 300\u00a0ng/L for Diclofenac, Sulfamethoxazole, Clonazepam, and Diazepam. Separation was evaluated by liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectroscopy. Results indicated that the removal efficiency depends on their Log\u00a0KOW, which is intrinsically related to their hydrophobicity and then, to their adsorption onto the surface (UF, NF, and AC). Also, NF, AC, and combined processes (UF\u00a0+\u00a0NF, UF\u00a0+\u00a0AC) were the most suitable separation techniques to obtain high removal efficiencies for most of the PCs used, except for Acetaminophen (which showed great removal efficacy using SBR). UF presented low removal yields for all PCs tested. ClO2 treatment was more effective at high concentration (50\u00a0mg ClO2/L). Furthermore, results also showed that there are significant differences on the performance of the processes applied and which treatment is the most effective for each PC analyzed.",

This research applied an advanced reduction process (ARP) that combined sulfite (SO32\u2212) as a reducing agent and UV as the activating method to remove bromate. In addition to photolysis, this UV\u2013sulfite ARP generates sulfite anion radicals (SO3\u2212) and aqueous electrons (eaq\u2212) that react with and reduce the target bromate. Results from batch experiments showed pseudo first-order removal of bromate with rate constants (Kobs) varying from 0.015 to 2.11\u00a0min\u22121. The effect of process variables like sulfite dose, pH and UV characteristics on the kinetics were studied. The reduction kinetics improved with increasing sulfite doses and UV intensities. Acidic pH resulted in decreased kinetics, with pH above 7, resulting in the highest observed rate constants. Two different UV wavelengths, 222\u00a0nm and 254\u00a0nm were used to activate sulfite in solution. Lower wavelength UV resulted in kinetics two orders of magnitude higher than UV at 254\u00a0nm. Quantum yields for this ARP were calculated to be in the range of 0.016\u20130.036\u00a0mol/Einstein. The principal reduction end products were bromide and sulfate, with recovery of bromide ranging from 80% to 90%.

The influence of inorganic ions (HCO\u22123, Cl\u2212, and SO4\u22122) that are usually present in municipal and industrial wastewater on the adsorption process is reported here. The adsorption properties of the adsorbent were investigated in solutions containing different inorganic ions concentrations at different pH levels. A strong concentration effect of the used AggFe, HCO3 and pH level of the purified water solution on removal efficiency was shown. It was found that phosphate adsorption onto the AggFe suspension may be described by pseudo-second order reaction kinetics and the Langmuir isotherm model. The rate-limiting step of phosphate adsorption onto AggFe suspension may be described by intra-particle diffusion of ions onto and within the adsorbent. The unique adsorption properties of synthesized AggFe adsorbent are demonstrated. This technique achieved a residual phosphate concentration of less than 0.1\u00a0ppm as PO4 also at high concentration (500\u00a0ppm) of the competitive HCO3 ion, which is acceptable by water quality regulations. The phosphate adsorption capacity on the AggFe at pH level of solution at pH 7.5 and an equilibrium concentration of 0.1\u00a0ppm as P was compared with reported results and are about 1.5 times higher than these values for granulated ferric hydroxide (fraction\u00a0<\u00a063\u00a0\u03bcm) for pH level 5.5, and more than one order of magnitude higher than other values reported in the literature.

     "abstract": "A novel electrocoagulation column (ECC) has been evaluated for the treatment of brackish groundwater to reduce the concentrations of Cr(VI) and other ions to be within drinking water limits. The ECC was fabricated from Plexiglas and had a rod anode and helical cathode; both electrodes were made from iron. The effect of influent flow rate, applied current density, initial concentration, pH and air mixing were studied at a temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C. The results showed that Cr(VI) removal rate was inversely proportional to the inlet flow rate and directly proportional to applied current density, reaching 100% chromium removal for initial chromium concentration of 5\u00a0mg/L at inlet flow rate of 30\u00a0mL/min with lowest energy consumption of 0.75\u00a0kWh/m3 and dissolved iron of 0.185\u00a0mg/L with an electrical cost of 0.03\u00a0US\u00a0$/m3 of treated groundwater. The EC column could also reduce other contaminants and metals ions such as Mg, Zn and Sr. Overall, the study affirmed that electrocoagulation is a reliable and environmentally compatible technique for the purification of groundwater.",

Various sorbents were screened for their ability to decolourize the dyeing wastewater.

Removal efficiencies of each unit process in powdered activated carbon (PAC) membrane hybrid system were evaluated as well. The hybrid system consists of two unit processes; a coarse powder activated carbon (C-PAC) contactor and a submerged membrane tank. A pilot plant having a capacity of 500\u00a0m3\u00a0day\u22121 was installed in W municipal drinking water treatment plant. C-PAC contactor has C-PAC (80\u2013150 mesh) slurry blanket with a high concentration of 30,000\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 and the blanket is maintained in the contactor without loss. After the adsorption capacity of the C-PAC was exhausted, C-PAC turned into a biological activated carbon. In step feeding tests, 2-MIB and geosmin were continuously injected to the raw water as a concentration of 50\u00a0ng\u00a0L\u22121 for 2-MIB and 200\u00a0ng\u00a0L\u22121 for geosmin.

However, detailed study on the fouling phenomena during the NF of dye is still limited. This paper provides the understanding on the performance and fouling phenomena of the polypiperazine amide nanofiltration (PA\u2013NF) membrane for the treatment of hazardous Congo red (CR) dye. The 20\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 dye at pH 9 was successfully 100% removed with minimum flux decline under the specific conditions: room temperature (25\u00a0\u00b0C) and trans-membrane pressure 5\u00a0bar. In addition, the membrane retained more Na2SO4 (62\u201391%) than NaCl (14\u201331%), owing to the ion size and negative charges on the membrane surface. The experimental results showed that fouling was the significant reason of the membrane flux decline which principally caused by the favourable/irreversible adsorption. Mechanisms of the PA\u2013NF membrane fouling were investigated using the linearized forms according to Wiesner and Aptel equations. It had been found that the fouling mechanisms were influenced by the solution pH and concentration. Under 20\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 of initial CR concentration at pH 9, the decline of permeate flux was due to standard blocking mechanism during the initial filtration. The cake formation took place rapidly at the second stage of filtration which contributed to the relatively constant permeate flux decline.",

The Cu-CMP wastewater generally contains nano-scale slurry particles and metal residues from polishing a wafer. The permeate water turbidity and UF flux for the removal of slurry particles using dilute solutions containing two commercial silica slurries were investigated. For both dilute silica slurries, permeate flux declined markedly as the particle concentration increased (500\u20132000\u00a0mg/l). Particle rejection rate exceeded 99.7%, and was independent of particle concentration. The ED process for removal of Cu2+ exceeded 99.3% with applied field strength of 1.5\u00a0V/cm and reaction time of 3\u00a0h. The Cu2+ was removed primarily from the solutions through adsorption onto cationic exchange membranes (CEMs) in the ED reactor. The continuous-flow ED study for low Cu2+ concentrations typical of Cu-CMP waste streams also had an excellent removal >98%. Additionally, the Cu2+ adsorbed on the CEMs was effectively recovered by 3% (w/w) HCl extraction but not by a reverse electrical field. Applications of the UF/ED system for treating actual Cu-CMP wastewater demonstrates sequential particle removal by UF and Cu2+ removal by ED, confirming the feasibility of the combined process to reclaim Cu-CMP wastewater.

In general, the removal efficiency of species responsible for scaling and fouling was enhanced by increasing the applied current density/voltage and contact times (30\u201360\u00a0s) in the EC chamber. High removal efficiencies of species potentially responsible for scale formation in reverse osmosis units such as calcium (100%), magnesium (87.9%), strontium (99.3%), barium (100%) and silicates (98.3%) were achieved. Boron was more difficult to eliminate (13.3%) and this was postulated to be due to the elevated solution pH. Similarly, fluoride removal from solution (44%) was also inhibited by the presence of hydroxide ions in the pH range 9\u201310. Analysis of produced flocs suggested the dominant presence of relatively amorphous boehmite (AlOOH), albeit the formation of Al(OH)3 was not ruled out as the drying process employed may have converted aluminium hydroxide to aluminium oxyhydroxide species. Evidence for adsorption of contaminants on floc surface sites was determined from FTIR studies. The quantity of aluminium released during the electrocoagulation process was higher than the Faradaic amount which suggested that the high salt concentrations in the coal seam water had chemically reacted with the aluminium electrodes.",

Thus, the present study explores the potential of perlite to sorb important metal ions such as Cd2+, Cu2+, Ni2+ and Pb2+ in single and multi-component solutions. Characterisation of perlite indicated that the material possesses low bulk density (148\u00a0kg/m3), high water holding capacity (27.5%) and high air-filled porosity (31.1%). Experimental results according to the Langmuir model revealed that perlite sorbed 0.130, 0.089, 0.057 and 0.025\u00a0mmol/g of Pb2+, Cu2+, Ni2+ and Cd2+ respectively, at an optimum pH of 5. The kinetics data were well described by pseudo-first order model, followed by the pseudo-second order and Elovich models. Quaternary sorption experiments showed that the presence of multiple ions had an adverse effect on the sorption capacity of perlite towards individual ions. Application of Sheindorf\u2013Rebhun\u2013Sheintuch equation to experimental quaternary isotherm data confirmed that sorption of Cd2+ ions was severely affected whereas Pb2+ ions were favoured.",

Quantification of aromatic amine clearly showed the removal of aromatic amines produced during the degradation process by the consortium in the textile effluent containing the dye and the persistence of the aromatic amine in the soil irrigated with untreated effluent containing the dye. Phytotoxicity studies carried out to find out the effectiveness of this bioremediation process confirmed the nontoxic nature of the effluent treated with consortium CN-1.

Compared to polymeric membranes, ceramic membranes offer remarkable advantages for filtration processes as they show excellent chemical, thermal and mechanical stability and can easily be cleaned by backflushing. YSZ powders with different particle sizes (30\u00a0nm, 40\u00a0nm and 90\u00a0nm) are individually and mixed processed by extrusion, dried and finally sintered at 1050\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h. The sintered YSZ capillaries are characterised by microstructural analysis including Hg-porosimetry, BET analysis and 3-point bending tests. By increasing the initial YSZ particle size, increased average membrane pore sizes ranging from 24\u00a0nm to 146\u00a0nm are obtained. Mechanically stable membranes are provided showing high open porosities of \u223c45% and \u223c36% for capillaries composed of single and mixed YSZ powders, respectively. By increasing the membrane pore size, reduced virus retention capacities in combination with increased water permeate fluxes are achieved. Capillaries made of YSZ-40\u00a0nm ensure both, log reduction values (LRV)\u00a0\u2265\u00a04 for small model bacteriophages MS2 and PhiX174 and high water permeate fluxes (\u223c30\u00a0L/(m2\u00a0hbar)), being suitable for sustainable virus filtration as requested by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).

     "abstract": "Recently, there has been an increasing use of forward osmosis (FO) technique for energy-efficient water treatment, leading to significant public concerns. One key know-how to make FO practical is developing an ideal draw solute characterized by high water flux, low reverse solute flux, and easy recovery. The recovery of draw solutes takes a significant energy cost in FO technology implementation. To this end, it is necessary to enhance the understanding of how different kinds of draw solutes are regenerated during the dewatering process. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current knowledge of draw solutes in terms of recovery from water. A variety of existing recovery methods developed so far to overcome the recovery barriers, including thermal separation, membrane separation, precipitation, stimuli\u2013response, combined processes, and direct use without recovery are presented. Discussions on the advantages and limits of the existing recovery methods are made based on acquired knowledge from the literature. Future directions for the effective and energy-efficient recovery of draw solutes are also provided.

A great difference was observed in zeta potential and size of the aluminum hydroxide precipitates from aluminum nitrate and aluminum sulfate (alum) solutions. While the isoelectric point (IEP) of aluminum nitrate precipitate has a fixed value (9), that of alum precipitates decreased with the salt concentration. The size of the early-formed fresh hydroxide precipitates of aluminum nitrate was around a few hundred nm in the acidic pH range, but increased from neutral pH up to 15\u00a0\u03bcm at the IEP. The particles of precipitates are colloidally stable in the pH range 5\u20136. In comparison, the size of alum precipitates was comparatively larger in the acidic up to neutral pH, and are colloidally unstable in the whole pH range. Relative influences of anions such as sulfate and phosphate, silicic acid, as well as citrate and oxalate on zeta potential and precipitate size are explicitly revealed experimentally. The results also indicate important roles of van der Waals attraction, as well as hydration force in the aggregation of the primary precipitates. Sulfate ions appear to significantly promote Al3+ precipitation in humic acid water. Overall, this work provides further insight on coagulation mechanisms of clay particles and natural organic materials (NOM) in water treatment, particularly in sweep coagulation.",

In the present study the adsorption behavior of arsenic was studied in detail by synthesizing a novel adsorbent by aggregating cobalt ferrite nanoparticles during the formation of iron oxide hydroxide, i.e. schwertmannite. Cobalt ferrite nanoparticle enhances the magnetic properties of schwertmannite and makes it a better candidate for arsenic removal. The various structural as well as morphological properties were investigated by VSM, XRD, FTIR, BET and FESEM analysis. Batch adsorption experiments were carried out by varying different process parameters such as contact time, adsorbent dose, pH, temperature and presence of other co-ions. Arsenic adsorption by cobalt ferrite nanoparticle aggregated schwertmannite (CNSh) was found to be highly pH sensitive. Maximum arsenic was adsorbed at around pH 5.3. Study of temperature effect on arsenic adsorption confirmed the endothermic nature of the process. Other thermodynamic properties were also calculated and found that physical adsorption was dominant with activation energy of 5.1\u00a0kJ/mol. Kinetic study revealed that the pseudo second order model was followed by the adsorption process having regression coefficient (R2) 0.99.

This paper evaluates the use of activated carbon (AC) filtration as an option to remove the residues of organic compounds present in deionized make-up water. The experimental part was done using continuous flow bench scale AC filters (AC dry volume 3.75\u00a0l, flow rate 25\u00a0l/h, water temperature approximately 20\u00a0\u00b0C) at a steam boiler desalination plant. Four commercial ACs were tested and all proved equally efficient removing approximately 42\u201345% of total and 58\u201368% of dissolved organic carbon after 30 days of operation. The most efficiently removed organic fractions were LMW neutral compounds, decomposition products of humic substances and hydrophobic compounds. Biopolymers were not effectively removed. Coconut shell based ACs leached more Ca, Mg and Na ions compared to coal based while for silica there were no differences. Pre-acid washing of ACs was efficient in reducing the initial leaching of impurities. However, the differences between acid washed and non-acid washed AC diminished with time.

Here we use wurtzite ZnS nanorods having open ends with only sulphur atoms, and therefore negatively polarized, which consequently catalyze adsorption of various cations on them. However, based on the ionic radius and oxidation state of the contaminant ion, such large scale adsorption initiates decomposition of the original nanostructure, followed by growth of new phases. This growth process leads to the formation of large grain solids which makes it easier to remove the contaminant ions from water by simple filtration techniques; in every case, a nearly ten times larger amount of the contaminant ion is removed for every mole of consumed ZnS. This important catalytic role of the polar nanosurface could therefore be exploited to develop an efficient method of water purification.",

The binary metal oxide (BMO) of Ca and Fe, synthesized using a Gastropod shell, as precursor, exhibited high removal efficiency (>99%) for pyrophosphate (PP), irrespective of initial PP concentration studied (25\u2013300\u00a0mg/L).

The determination of the saturation index (SI) value of calcium pyrophosphate and application of the principle of constant solubility product affirmed the role of precipitation as a paramount factor in the PP removal process by BMO, in addition to the complex formation between any of the ionic species (i.e. Ca and Fe) in the system. The XRD analysis of the derived sludge revealed the formation of amorphous calcium pyrophosphate. Process variables optimization revealed that initial solution pH, organic load, and ionic strength had no negative impact on the PP removal efficiency.

     "abstract": "Adsorption is an important process for arsenic removal from drinking water supplies. Fixed bed column processes are the preferred mode of operation owing to their simplicity and proven performance. Mathematical models can facilitate the design and optimization of fixed bed adsorbers. For systems exhibiting linear isotherm behavior over the relevant concentration range, their performance can be predicted using models that are amenable to analytical solutions. The predictive utility of an asymptotic solution of the homogeneous surface diffusion model (HSDM) and an approximate solution of a linear driving force model (LDFM) under linear isotherm approximation was evaluated in this study. A previously published pilot test on arsenic breakthrough in a fixed bed adsorber of polymer-supported nanoparticles was modeled. Model parameters were estimated on the basis of some easily determined batch measurements. The pilot test yielded 27,000 bed volumes at 10\u00a0\u03bcg/L arsenic. The two analytical solutions predicted 24,200 and 27,100 bed volumes. Despite the simplicity of the HSDM and LDFM solutions, their predictions agreed well with the experimental data. These analytical solutions are very straightforward, easy to apply, and provide acceptable modeling power.",

The specificity of each resin was calculated from batch kinetic tests and results confirmed that the A532E and PSR-2 resins are more specific than the others for perchlorate removal. Furthermore, these results show PSR-2 and PWA-5 resins follow a pseudo-first order relation whereas exchanges are better described by pseudo-second order relations. The rate limiting step of ion exchange process was identified, for A400E, A520E and A532E as being the intraparticular diffusion, while PSR-2 and PWA-5 resins have an ion exchange rate limited by the external diffusion. Finally, the isotherm experiments show that the ion exchange equilibrium for perchlorate can be modelled by Langmuir relation for all resins and confirm that perchlorate ions are fixed forming a monolayer without interaction between molecules. The Langmuir model results indicate the maximal exchange capacities for perchlorates are of the same order of magnitude for all resins (from 183\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121 for A400E to 115\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121 for A532E).

The adsorption capacity increased with the increasing temperature, initial dye concentration, pH and ionic strength, although it was not affected by the stirring speed. The value of zeta potential decreased with the increasing pH. Experimental adsorption data were modelled by different equilibrium isotherms such as Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Dubinin\u2013Radushkevich (D\u2013R), BET, Halsey, Harkins\u2013Jura, Smith and Henderson isotherms.

Kinetic studies have shown that the reaction between F and Ca ions in aqueous phase is fast and completed within 20\u00a0min at stoichiometric ratio. Reactions carried out with method of excess (keeping calcium concentration very high) showed pseudo-first order kinetics for both Ca(OH)2 and CaCl2.Parameters such as effect of reactant loading, reactant ratio and temperature which affect the particle size were studied. The maximum particle size of calcium fluoride (CaF2) was observed to be around 1\u00a0\u03bcm and 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm for Ca(OH)2 and CaCl2 respectively. The reactant ratio studies showed that an increase in the calcium dose decreases final fluoride concentration upto USEPA and WHO standards. Temperature showed an accelerating effect on reaction kinetics for both the reactions. The CaF2 particle size essentially remained unaltered with an increase in temperature for both the reactions.

Struvite also forms on the digester walls eventually reducing the available digester volume. At the South District Waste Water Treatment Plant (SDWWTP) in Miami-Dade County, Florida, struvite formation has increased the plant maintenance costs due to the frequent need for replacement of plugged pipes. The purpose of this study was to control struvite formation by reducing phosphate availability in the digesters. Full scale and bench scale tests were performed at the SDWWTP to control struvite formation by limiting the available phosphate. Phosphate availability was limited by ferric chloride addition prior to sludge dewatering by centrifugation. The ferric ion binds the available phosphorous forming ferric phosphate which is captured in the sludge cake due to its low solubility. The results of this study showed that reducing the total phosphorous available in the digested sludge prevented struvite formation in the sludge handling lines and anaerobic digesters. Economic analyses showed that the amount of available phosphorous can be reduced by about 35% without additional costs.",

The wastewater which was subject to membrane treatment process was collected at the point of discharge without undergoing any pre-treatment process. The separation performances of membranes were characterized with respect to BOD5, COD, turbidity and conductivity removal while the membrane sustainability was evaluated based on the water flux recovery. Promising results of COD and turbidity removal (between 97.8 and 99.9%) were able to achieve regardless of membrane type, indicating the size of pollutants contributing to COD and turbidity values are significantly larger than 100\u00a0kDa. Removal rates of BOD5 and conductivity were found to be strongly dependent on the membrane pore size. As NF-90 exhibited the smallest pore structure among the membranes studied, it showed the highest BOD5 (86.8%) and conductivity removal (82.3%). In terms of sustainability, it is found that the original water flux of NF-90 was able to be retrieved by >50% compared to between 15 and 38% reported in the UF membranes, after only a simple rinsing process. This indicated that NF-90 is less susceptible to fouling and is more suitable and reliable to be employed for restaurant wastewater treatment.",

Rejection of neutral compounds in colloid-free natural waters increased in the presence of HSs. The negative impact of cations on rejection was more prominent in the HS-dominated River water when compared to the Lake water.

Prior to the treatment of hot dyeing solution of 80\u00a0\u00b0C, the PVDF membranes were characterized in terms of scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, gas permeation, liquid entry pressure, contact angle and membrane porosity. It is reported that the surface roughness, contact angle and liquid entry pressure of PVDF membrane were increased while mean pore size and porosity decreased with increasing PVDF concentration in the dope from 12 to 18\u00a0wt%. Based on the DCMD results, it is found that 12\u00a0wt% PVDF membrane showed the highest permeate flux due to its smooth surface, high membrane porosity, large mean pore size as well as big macrovoids formed at the middle cross-section of the hollow fibre membrane. Although MD flux tended to decrease with increasing polymer concentration, all the resulting membranes were still able to achieve excellent dye rejection (at least 99.78%), indicating that MD is very potential to be employed in treating dyeing solution which normally discharged in hot condition from textile industry.",

The prepared sorbents were characterized using FTIR, SEM with EDAX, XRD and TGA\u2013DSC studies. Sorption studies were performed at different temperatures, equilibrium time, pH values and in the presence of foreign ions in batch mode. Maximum fluoride adsorption occurred at pH 7 for both LZMO and CLZMOB. The kinetic study revealed an optimum equilibrium time as 50\u00a0min with an adsorbent dose of 100\u00a0mg/L at room temperature. The sorption data were fitted well with Langmuir isotherm. Thermodynamic parameters such as \u0394G\u00b0, \u0394H\u00b0, and \u0394S\u00b0 indicated that the nature of fluoride sorption is spontaneous and endothermic. The column experiment with CLZMOB at neutral pH was successfully employed for the removal of fluoride ions from synthetic fluoride water. 0.1\u00a0M NaOH was used for desorption studies and the regeneration ability was tested. Based on the column experiment, a defluoridation model has been illustrated. The results showed that CLZMOB could be an effective sorbent for the removal of fluoride from aqueous solutions.",

It is listed as an carcinogen by IARC and US EPA and stringent limits have been set for it in industrial wastewater (discharged into water bodies containing cadmium) as well as in drinking water. Therefore, an efficient and economic process to remove cadmium from aqueous solution is a pressing need. In this paper, all the available processes to remove cadmium from aqueous solution have been listed and the broad range of research work done by researchers in this field has been evaluated. The operational conditions of various processes have been briefly discussed. About 218 published studies are reviewed in this paper in order to provide insight into efficient and economic processes for the removal of cadmium. From the study, it is evident that adsorption, especially Biosorption, has been used by most of the researchers during the last few decades and it has proved to be a very efficient and economic process. But a lack of recent work has been observed in the area of precipitation and coagulation which could otherwise be an economic and convenient method.",

At the primary stage, because of the high loading of organics, anaerobic treatment method was found to be the best practice nowadays. However, at the later stages, the treatment methods vary. As an option to available secondary and tertiary treatment method, we used an aerated heterogeneous Fenton process to remove chemical oxygen demand (COD) from anaerobically treated palm oil mill effluent (AT-POME). The Box\u2013Behnken design (BBD) and response surface method (RSM) were used to design and optimize the performance of the process. Furthermore, the regression quadratic model representing the COD removal efficiency of aerated heterogeneous Fenton was developed and validated by the analysis of variances (ANOVA).

Regarding the systems production yield, the field study results obtained are successfully compared to those predicted by the method developed in this work, based on the evaluation, in laboratory, of the characteristic permeabilities of the porous media of the studied systems.

The adsorption capacity for TCP was significantly enhanced by 2.3 times through surfactant treatment of the bentonite. The effect of pH, Initial concentration, contact time, adsorbent dose, ionic strength and temperature on adsorption of TCP was investigated. A strong dependence of the adsorption capacity on pH was observed, the capacity increasing as the pH value decreased. The long alkyl chains of intercalated HDTMA increased the hydrophobicity of the adsorbent and provided particular affinity for TCP molecules. The adsorbent showed high efficiency towards TCP and >99.0% removal was achieved from an initial concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcmol/L at pH 3.0. The kinetics of the adsorption process was described by a pseudo-first-order model. Film diffusion was found to be the rate-limiting step. The adsorption isotherm was consistent with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, and maximum monolayer capacity of the adsorbent was found to be 70.42\u00a0\u03bcmol/g at 30\u00a0\u00b0C, which was higher than that of commercial activated carbon (52.63\u00a0\u03bcmol/g).

The impact of pre-coagulation on membrane reversible and irreversible fouling, as well as the retention of organic micropollutants, was investigated at bench scale. Jar test experiments indicated that the optimum alum dosage for removal of biopolymers, based on a point of diminishing returns analysis, was relatively low (0.5\u00a0mg/L as coagulant; 0.05\u00a0mg/L as Al3+). This dose was effective at reducing membrane reversible and irreversible fouling (up to 48%) for waters with higher concentrations of organics (>4\u00a0mg/L as DOC) over 24\u00a0h of permeation and backwash cycles. Biopolymers were identified as contributing to both reversible and irreversible fouling. The retention of organic micropollutants was relatively low for UF alone (<40%) and for coagulation alone (<30%) with higher removals observed in waters with greater concentrations of organic matter. For combined coagulation and UF, retention of some compounds increased by up to 25%. In general, retention was higher for neutral, more hydrophobic compounds (log\u00a0Kow\u00a0>\u00a02). This study demonstrates that a low dose of coagulant, optimized for biopolymer removal, may reduce membrane fouling and may provide value added for the retention of some organic micropollutants; however dosages depend on the specific water being treated, as well as treatment-related water quality targets.",

The viability and efficiency of a sedimentation process at different times followed by an aeration system was examined. The addition of Effective Micro-organism (EM) to the sedimentation process to enhance the efficiency was investigated. The experimental method involves monitoring of specific water quality constituents under varying operating conditions at different sedimentation times, EM doses and aeration rates. The purpose is to reach the unrestricted water reuse. Grey water treatment was examined first in batch experiments to determine the optimum operating conditions including: the settling time, the dose of EM and the aeration time. The obtained optimum conditions were implemented in pilot plant investigation. The pilot plant study was examined at both 3.0 and 4.5\u00a0h settling time followed by aeration for 90\u00a0min; the removal rates were 70.8, 63.1, 70.6 and 63.5% for the TSS, COD, BOD5 and oil & grease, respectively.

Precise knowledge of both the fouling type (organic, inorganic, or biological) and the fouling mechanism (gel formation, adsorption, deposition, pore blockage, or cake formation) is the key to success in UF membrane cleaning.",
