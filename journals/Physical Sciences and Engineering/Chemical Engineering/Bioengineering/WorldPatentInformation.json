     "abstract": "PATSTAT is the worldwide patent statistical database created and maintained by the European Patent Office. Many methods and techniques have been developed to increase its accuracy and completeness. This paper contributes to this body of research. It proposes an allocation procedure which reduces by 44% the number of empty entries concerning the residence country of patentees, and, at the same time, it increases by 22% the accuracy of country code allocation. The procedure consists of a replicable SQL query to be run in PATSTAT. An application of this procedure illustrates that patent analyses based on raw data underestimate the role of China and Japan in the area of climate change mitigation technologies.",

     "abstract": "In this study, we proposed combined kernel-based methods to leverage patent citation graph performance for patent classification. The concept is to use the combined graph kernels of the citation graph to classify patent documents, as a hybrid approach. A multiple kernel framework was used for integrating multiple datasets of various kernels into a combined kernel. We employed seven graph kernels as the baselines and the combination of random walks and Weisfeiler–Lehman subtree kernels to achieve higher performance. We calculated the kernel values of each patent pairwise and employed an SVM classifier to carry out the classification task. The investigation results demonstrate that the combined graph kernel outperforms single kernels.",

Hydrogen appears as a potential substitute for fossil fuels. In this way, the objective of this study is to map the hydrogen economy through the patent consultation in the period 1998–2018. The documents found were tabulated in order to characterize the technological advance over the 1998–2018, showing countries that publish and priority patents and the major assignees. This time range was chosen due to the fact that prior to 1998 the number of patents for these technologies was not significant. The searches were conducted on the Questel Orbit platform. Data were filtered using some keywords and the International Patent Classification (IPC). The results show that Japan and United States are the countries with the highest number of patent families by priority. This fact indicates that there are expressive efforts for the technological advance, thus contributing, to be the countries that stand out in these technologies. This research shows that the assignees with the highest number of patents families by priority are Toyota Motor and Honda Motor.",

The research priority areas considered were ICT, nanotechnology, biotechnology, climate change, energy and health. Patents in the areas were compared with the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries and Egypt. The comparison was done using the revealed technological advantage sometimes referred to as the specialisation index. It is found that the two African countries have not increased their patent share significantly and are yet to find their specialisation. It was found that while South Africa is doing well in terms of patenting compared to other developing countries, the profile of inventions being patented are not necessarily aligned with the priority areas as documented in government policy.",

The model constructed based on the Value Capture Theory effectively combines the cost method and the benefit method in traditional assessment methods, avoiding the problem of obtaining the patent transaction data that market method required. The calculating process which adopts triangle fuzzy matrix increases the objectivity of the evaluation process. Different criteria for eight different fields of petroleum are applied in this paper, which make each specific patent evaluation model suitable for the petroleum industry. In addition, the process of evaluation becomes relatively simple and easy to implement.",

Regarding patent information, some new document kind codes have been created in order to cope with the additional procedures provided for in the new Act. On the other hand, as a consequence of the implementation of substantive examination, the new Act seems to have fostered the use of patent information services as a means to ensure in advance the novelty and inventiveness of the patent applications.

Remarkable examples thereof can already be found in the fields of interconnected „smart“ products and natural care products. Few companies have access to the entire range of available knowledge; most are required to obtain this knowledge from other companies or research institutes. One way to acquire the requisite knowledge is through co-operation. When at least three companies from different industries are cooperating for this purpose, we speak of multi-cross-industry innovation. This kind of innovation is reflected in many cases of patenting. For a deeper understanding, we identify multi-cross-industry innovation patents in the leading market of the USA, using a combined search on PATSTAT and Orbis in the period from 1980 to 2015. We apply a time series analysis, an applicant analysis, a priority country analysis, an analysis of co-operation structure, and an analysis of the application domains to the data. Our results show an increase in the occurrence of multi-cross-industry innovation patents. The major players involved in this are Japanese companies, which apply for nearly 90% of all multi-cross-industry innovation patents.

It is shown how to structure and refocus a search in Espacenet, although it has to be kept in mind that Espacenet does not offer all features the highly sophisticated search tools of examiners have. It is explained how to set up a search table and how to find the appropriate classification using Espacenet. The search table helps to structure and prioritise the search. A complete search strategy is not only about finding novelty destroying documents, but should also include searching documents relevant for inventive step. It is demonstrated how to use the problem-solution-approach to refocus the search towards inventive step.",

We demonstrate a method of comparing the CPC patent documentation coverage to the IPC patent documentation coverage down to IPC subgroup level and how this can be applied to improve the efficiency of classification based search. The coverage of the CPC relative to the IPC must be understood in terms of: the CPC being assigned to families, and the IPC being assigned to individual documents.

Unfortunately, most documents (around 75%), that were just named and dated, were burned in a fire, which occurred on December 15, 1836. Such documents received this specific identification (X-Patent) because they were retrospectively renumbered. We applied new procedures such as data mining to arrive at new correlations and results.

The expected users are Technology Transfer Offices, which can support the decision-making process of investing on risky projects for its further commercialization.

A second goal of this paper is to demonstrate the relevance of Markush structures for patent searches in a quantitative manner. Another goal is the development of a set of simple indicators which can be applied to the search results of structure-based patent searches. Four indicators have been chosen with special focus on the relevance of Markush structures for patent searches. The searches and the analysis were carried out with ten pharmaceutical examples. The results show in a quantitative manner, that a search in the Markush database yields a number of inventions (patent families) that cannot be found via searches in specific structure databases alone.",

     "abstract": "A patent can be defined as a temporary and territorial right granted by the state to the patentee to exclusively exploit, license or foreclose third party the subject matter of its invention. When a patent application is filed, the applicant, among other requirements, must sufficiently disclose the claimed invention so that a person skilled in the art can carry out it. Nevertheless, sufficiency of disclosure, besides being one of the requirements needed to grant a patent, also plays an important role in the so-called “quid pro quo”. Thus, a patent can be considered not only as a “reward”, but also as a “contract” between innovators and society, in which a temporary property right is granted in tradeoff for disclosure. In light of the mentioned above, the aim of this work is to carry out a comparative study on the practices regarding sufficiency of disclosure requirements in three of the largest patent offices around the world; EPO, JPO, USPTO as well as in the Brazilian National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI-BR). The differences and similarities with respect to sufficiency of disclosure requirements among these offices are compared. Ultimately, what innovation could gain with a more harmonized patent specification is discussed.",

     "publication date": "12-2017",
     "abstract": "For a broad variety of innovation intelligence tasks, like finding the patent agent being specialised in a technology, specialisation profiles of entities are of particular interest. Such a profile indicates for each entity in which activities it is markedly specialised. Conventional approaches suffer two shortcomings, though. First, they tend to consider only the activity profiles of the respective entities, while neglecting information about all other entities' activities. Second, they often lack in considering entity specific characteristics, when assigning an activity to an entity's specialisation profile or not.To address these shortcomings, we introduce the RSI-specialisation, a novel method for retrieving dichotomous and idiotypic specialisation profiles. Operationalising relative specialisation, the novel method is rooted in the theory of comparative advantage. In order to contrast it with the approaches based on absolute specialisation, it is compared with the baseline method ENF- specialisation, which has its theoretical roots in the concept of effective number of components.Both methods are demonstrated by applying them to the case of the specialisation of patent agent firms. RSI-specialisation and ENF-specialisation are applied to a data set containing all EPO patent applications in 2014 and 2015.Compared to the baseline approach, the RSI-specialisation reduces noise from market effects to a greater satisfaction. Besides being less dependent on agent size and market structure, it reduces interpretation to the most essential question for an applicant, i.e. why he should opt for one rather than another provider. In addition, it also guarantees that a potential applicant can find in any field a specialised patent agent firm.We find that the novel RSI-specialisation promises to be a robust and reliable method for retrieving dichotomous and idiotypic specialisation profiles. Patent agent firms aside, it could be applied to a multitude of different domains, like the specialisation of other professional workers, of politicians, experts in consulting firms or even to users in online-shops and patients in clinical trials.",

     "abstract": "In the current information technology era, Bioinformatics is growing rapidly due to availability of vast database systems and the ever increasing amount of biological data. It is a flexible and creative means of storing, managing, and querying of complex biological datasets. With these rapid advancements in today's technology-driven age, it is also imperative that protection in the form of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) is sought for such research and development activity. In addition, there is a need to formulate an aggressive strategy to protect one's IP. In fact, various companies', universities', institutions' and researchers' are into the process to protect their core invention. This landscape will give an outline of the latest technological growth, geographical distribution, and top competitors playing an important role in this field.",

     "abstract": "Patent management has become increasingly important in technology-oriented companies. The patent itself does not only protect an invention against imitation, it also has a variety of other functions. For example, patents can be used for generating revenues by licensing to other companies as well as for gathering competitor information. To handle all these functions in an appropriate and balanced way, a professional patent management method is required. To achieve this, we aim to design a maturity model for patent management – the 7D Patent Management Maturity Model – that offers companies assistance in building, improving and reviewing their patent management. We define seven dimensions, namely portfolio, generation, intelligence, exploitation, enforcement, organization, and culture. The first five dimensions are core dimensions, the latter two supporting dimensions. We continue with an explanation of the guiding principles behind these dimensions, and finally illustrate the application of the model, showing how it can be used for the organizational development of a company's patent management.",

     "abstract": "The Patent Documentation Group (PDG) ONLINE Working Group has undertaken a study comparing different aspects of emerging market country coverage amongst 5 commercial sources of patent information. The sources were compared against the national patent office registers for each of 9 ‘emerging market’ countries, as well as Inpadoc/Espacenet. Coverage was assessed in relation to 25 patent families occupying the pharmaceutical and household or specialty chemical technical domains. In general, vendors were shown to have added value in terms of country coverage over the ‘baseline’ offered by Inpadoc/Espacenet but to varying degrees fell short of the ‘gold standard’ offered by registers. These variances were explored, and conclusions and recommendations were shared with the vendors in order to facilitate product development. In a separate effort, observations relating to the design, searchability and reliability of registers were collated and communicated to the PDG IMPACT working group who commonly liaise with WIPO. This has culminated in a proposal being made by the Committee on WIPO Standards (CWS) to set up a task force on standards for (all) patent office registers during 2017.",

Indeed, in recent years, it has become more and more complex to provide professional patent analysis due to the growth of the total number of patent documents, of which two/thirds are patent applications. Always more often, the pool of documents resulting from a patent search contains documents that have not ended their procedure, contain amended parts and/or are still waiting for future events that might radically change the fortune of the patent, misleading any earlier opinion about it. Thus, patent specialist cannot simply search for all relevant patents and interpret the first version offered by patent repositories. In order to avoid grossest errors, it is crucial to identify the most representative document from a patent family, gather information from all other patents of the same family, work always on the last updated files, fix the patent in the timeline procedure in order to measure future changes that can still happen. This paper analyses some of most frequent problems and errors faced in patent searches and offers a vade-mecum about most critical aspects to be taken into account, useful links and good practices, resulting from procedural and/or legal reasons.",

Hence, when compared with NPEs without any R&D involvement, R&D-performing NPEs appeared able to monetize their patents without resorting to excessive litigation. Thus, different NPEs could exert different influences and drive patent market dynamics in their own respective ways.",

The border between “beauty and usefulness” of a product is often quite blurred, and there are differences in the approach of the law and the jurisprudence at national level from country to country. Hence, it is not often easy to say if, how, where and how long an industrial design can be protected, and this uncertainty can be of great impact on authors and industry, who risk losing protection on their original works.

We apply semantic patent measurement and discuss RadViz as a powerful method to visualize the measurement's results and to provide insightful motion patterns for monitoring technology change. Moreover, we present an algorithm to define so called anchor points as high dimensional reference points by using textual elements of patents. By the example of carbon fiber reinforcements we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach. Thus, our approach enables academics to analyze important types of technological patterns like convergence or divergence by means of a new instrument and gives practitioners like the R&D management of companies the opportunity to build a reliable strategic business decision support.",

Information was collected about the number of ISO standard certification documents that Turkish organizations received in respect of these standards between the period of 2007 and 2013. For the same period, information about the number of granted patents, petty patents, trademarks and industrial designs in Turkey were also collected. The information was analyzed by year, industrial property right type and ISO standard. A Spearman correlation analysis was also conducted to determine the strength of association between the number of certification documents and the number of granted industrial property rights. The analysis showed that some of the ISO standards had either a positive or negative linear relationship with one or more of the granted industrial property right types. Although the total number of certification documents had decreased over the time period of the study, the number of granted industrial property rights in Turkey had increased over the same period indicating that the adoption of quality managment system standards may have led to an increase in national innovation in Turkey. This observation may help to improve innovation in other countries similar to Turkey.",

     "abstract": "A debate over whether a search is a chemistry or a biology search is becoming increasingly more frequent within search teams. The line between non-text chemistry and biology searching has become blurred in recent years. The appearance of “non-natural” amino acids and modified peptides, for example, has given rise to the questions: Is it a structure? Is it a sequence? Could it be both? It may not be a question of one or the other, but perhaps working with a colleague to bring the best possible answer to the client. Several examples clarify the line and present guidance when beginning a search. Consider the size of the molecule, how many amino acids are present and what the client needs in order to best cover all bases and create a more comprehensive search report.",

     "abstract": "Professional search in patent repositories poses several unique challenges. One key requirement is to search the entire affected space of concepts, following well-defined procedures to ensure traceability of results obtained. Several techniques have been introduced to enhance query generation, preferably via automated query term expansion, to improve retrieval effectiveness. Currently, these approaches are mostly limited to computing additional query terms from patent documents based on statistical measures. For conceptual search to solve the limitation of traditional keyword search standard dictionaries are used to provide synonyms and keyword phrases for query refinement. Studies show that these are insufficient in such highly specialized domains. In this paper, we present an approach to extract keyword phrases from query logs created during the validation procedure of the patent applications. This creates valuable domain-specific lexical databases for several specific patent classes that can be used to both expand as well as limit the scope of a patent search. This provides a more powerful means to guide a professional searcher through the search process. We evaluate the lexical databases based on real query sessions of patent examiners.",

     "abstract": "In recent years, intellectual property (IP) has become a crucial aspect in modern management practices, especially for innovative technology-based organizations. Correspondingly, growing numbers of studies are conducted each year to address various aspects of IP management (IPM). Nevertheless, the research field is still relatively fragmented and researchers lack a systematic understanding of the existing body of knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the underlying knowledge structure and the evolution of IPM research. To accomplish this goal, we analyzed 773 source articles published between 1980 and 2012 using bibliometric techniques including citation and co-citation analysis. We broadly searched for research articles that focused on IP management in the two largest academic databases (Web of Science and Scopus) and manually refined the search results. The results indicate that intellectual property management is a fast-growing research field with theoretical roots in law, economics, and management. Based on the citation data, we identified the most cited studies that form the intellectual core of IPM research. A co-citation diagram was plotted and five main research themes were uncovered. The center of the diagram is formed by studies on the role of IP in improving firms' appropriability. Surrounding the center are studies on the openness of IP strategy and the economic impact of the patent system; the former has become a heated topic over the recent decade, while the latter has lost popularity. Another two groups of studies emerged at the rear of the diagram, namely IP valuation and optimal IP licensing strategy. The article concludes by providing suggestions and implications for future research.",

This article identifies and characterises inequalities occurring at the level of patent information management, and it discusses some possible measures to mitigate them. Three measures are proposed, that is, rationalising and harmonising the European patent information system, introducing tools to facilitate the retrieval of multilingual information, and enhancing the infrastructure for the dissemination of knowledge on the use of patent information. This article also presents some unpublished figures revealing that the European patent system is more multilingual than commonly believed. There is a mismatch between the current language regime of the Office and the actual needs of European innovators for multilingual patent information. These results confirm the relevance of new initiatives to manage patent information more effectively by reducing existing inequalities in this area.",

Firstly, three common factors are obtained in correspondence to the respective three dimensions of the patent indicators. Secondly, the proposed composite value index can effectively summarize the information conveyed by every single indicator, because the reduction of the goodness-of-fit of the market value model is very limited as compared to the case of the indicators taken separately. Thirdly, a robustness analysis of the composite value index was conducted, relying on post-grant information, such as opposition and renewal decisions, and the results are consistent with the market value model with the composite value index solely considered.

The total number of university based related patent applications represent 5% of the total volume of patent applications from Dutch origin.A subsequent survey among companies exploiting university research based IP, was carried out to gather information on their actual use of their IP in terms of manpower involved in product or market development and estimated monetary value of the patents. 78 companies responded to this survey. The main findings reveal that a variety of IP exploitation strategies has been used. Overall, more than 50% of the patents still wait to be used for further development and innovations. The number of jobs created by spin offs from university research institutes is approximately 9500 jobs over a period of 10 years. Average revenues from these patents amounted to € 42,000. Several findings from our small-scale national survey on patent exploitation with regards to use and monetary values are in line with general results from the large-scale European PatVal survey and the APE-INV survey.",

     "publication date": "09-2014",
     "abstract": "This paper deals with one of the single most important innovations made in Great Britain since World War II. It is certainly one of the greatest process inventions of the twentieth century. The float process is one of the most widely used methods for flat glass manufacturing as it ensures security, high quality and productivity. From a historical point this innovation was the beginning of a revolutionary change in the mass production of flat glass for the building and automotive sectors. More specifically this innovation eliminates the traditional operations of rolling, grinding and polishing the glass surface while creating a high quality and inexpensive flat glass product. The first patent was applied for on December 10th, 1953 by Pilkington and Bickerstaff. This paper presents a brief discussion from the 1960s in a historical perspective about this amazing discovery and the main patents related to it. More than 23,900 patents using the term “flat glass” have been filed around the world, according to the European Patent Office databases. These numbers just continue to grow as do total sales worldwide. Looking for titles using flat glass, we found 2,409 patents filed. Curiously, for the same period 1,131 patents were published with float glass in the title and just 3,995 with the term in the title or abstract. So, statistically, there are more published patents using the term ‘flat’ than ‘float’ glass process.",

     "publication date": "09-2014",
     "abstract": "The most commonly seen patents are invention patents, utility models and design patents. Among them, utility models are the most controversial type. The purpose of utility models is to quickly protect creations of lower technological levels or with a shorter life cycle. Nonetheless, the most optimal length of the term of utility models remains an open question. Utility models in Taiwan are the focus of this study, and International Patent Classification (IPC) was used here for the random sampling of the utility models. The investigators discussed the granting of the utility model and the expiring of utility models prematurely in Taiwan over the past ten years (2003–2012). The results suggest that compared to other sections, Section A (human necessities) and Section E (fixed constructions) of IPC have a shorter term of utility model maintaining. Aside from a higher expiration rate, their utility model terms are on average just over 3 years. As for the Section H (electricity) and Section C (chemistry, metallurgy), their utility model terms are slightly longer than those of other utility model sections and the number of renewed cases are also greater. In addition to a lower expiration rate, the utility model terms of these two sections are sometimes longer than five years. The study results can perhaps also be used as a reference by countries interested in introducing the utility model for determining the term of utility models.",

This seems contradictory to the original intention of the patent system (enabling firms to create temporary monopolies to appropriate returns from their R&D investments). Consequently, this paper explores why firms make their patents available for free and which benefits they may gain from this behaviour. Adopting the open source software phenomenon as a background and using firm data from 26 patent release cases, we identify a typology consisting of four motives of ‘free patent release approaches’: profit making, cost cutting, innovation catalysing, technology providing. Further, we discuss the motives of these firms to offer their patents as ‘open source’. We find that firms may obtain valuable technological input for subsequent innovations as well as social benefits in return for their free patent release.",

     "abstract": "In all relevant patent systems an adversely affected party has the possibility to appeal the patent office's decision in front of a patent court or Board of Appeal (BoA). Within a European context, the EPO is, in a way, even engaging in de facto competition with national patent offices. As an example, the German Patent and Trademark Office (DPMA) provides quasi identical patent products and offers the same kind of legal recourse to the German patent court (BPatGer) for these products. Both offices offer an opposition procedure which is open for appeal, and also in the case of a refusal, both offices offer the possibility of appeals. Thus, the EPO Boards of Appeal are engaged in making decisions every year on around 2000 cases and, e.g., the BPatGer on 600 cases regarding the legal validity of the first instance's work. It is thus remarkable that, so far, nobody has systematically included the work of the patent courts in a statistical legal validity evaluation in the context of the Patent & Trademark Offices' (PTOs') quality assurance systems.Since there is obviously a need to establish a common standard for the comparison of first and second instance legal teachings in patent law, a methodology for comparative legal validity analysis is proposed in this paper. I have tested and optimised the approach while working as a project manager at the European Patent Office, based on analysis of 2300 appeal decisions from seven annual batches.",

They were discovered by Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen in Würzburg, Germany, on November 8, 1895, who published on December 28, 1895. This discovery played a role in the beginning of revolutionary changes in the understanding of the physical world. The first patent was published on March 21, 1896, in record time by Siemens & Halske (S&H) Company. Soon other patents for new advances were claimed. A remarkable development was proposed by William David Coolidge's patent in 1913 with General Electric (GE). Surprisingly, Röntgen did not apply for patents for the inventions based on his discoveries, and donated the money from his Nobel Prize to the University of Würzburg. This paper presents a brief history about this amazing discovery and its notable related patents. More than 19,000 patents were filed around the world until 2013 according to searches made on the European Patent Office databases. For the same period there were published 277 patents naming Röntgen in the title or abstract, and 648 using Roentgen. Up to the so-called golden era (1950s) most of the patents were from companies such as Philips, GE and Westinghouse, by a range of different inventors.",

This ranking technique, called Horváth–Materne ranking or pivot ranking, is based on the assumption that the best documents will not only mention the search concepts in full-text databases, but will also mention at least some of the concepts in corresponding abstract databases. The more concepts present in the abstracts, the greater the probability that the document is relevant. In principle the technique could be used to rank results in any database where both full-text and abstracts are available. The technique can be broadened by including an automatic concept extraction.",

It also summarizes evidence from previous surveys. All available information indicates that only a few Spanish firms holding patents license them out. Results from the OEPM/OECD survey also reveal that obtaining public support is the first financial use of patents for Spanish firms. Responses to the same OECD questionnaire by EPO patent applicants from several European countries are quite different: licensing out is an extended practice among EPO patent holders from different countries, including Spain, and convincing venture capitalists and private investors are their two most important financial uses of patents. In our view this suggests that there are significant differences across European countries as regards the development of national technology markets and results from international surveys are driven by responses from the largest and more developed countries. The drivers and actors in markets for patents that only protect inventions nationally may be quite distinct from those in markets for patents that protect inventions regionally, such as EPO patents within Europe.",

However, there is little evidence of technological specialization. Breaking down the portfolio into foreign-assigned, Iranian-assigned, unassigned and Iranian-sponsored patents, indicates that foreign-assigned, followed by Iranian-assigned patents are of higher quality and potential value. Nearly half of the patents are unassigned and 40% are assigned to foreign entities. Lack of ownership assignment can be a hurdle to effective exploitation, defense and maintenance of patents.

Comparing Canada's patent profile with that of other countries using different patent statistics suggests that Canadian companies do not utilize patents as much as their counterparts in other industrialized countries. This is despite the fact that IP protection in Canada is not an obstacle to innovation according to the surveys of Canadian innovative companies.",

Then, it used the experts feature word groups, which were formalized by INSPEC control words, to construct a Domain Knowledge Organization System (DKOS). Base on the DKOS, a retrieval module of patent information is constructed, which has practical significance for designers to design products and develop new technology.

     "abstract": "The handling of IPR by SMEs is on average still quite poor, leading to missed chances of proper protection, risks due to possible patent infringements and ignorance of the vast pool of available technical information and potential innovation triggers provided by the many million patent documents accessible using patent searches. Existing IPR tools are often devised for larger companies and genuine IPR experts, and some tools are often considered by SME personnel to be difficult to handle and therefore are little used at the SME level.Therefore, the approach of a funded project together with SMEs as intended users has been undertaken in Austria. Based on a mutually defined standardised innovation process according to the stage-gate model, seven valuable yet easy-to-handle IPR tools have been developed, ranging from a guideline to patent searches to a decision guidance for the frequently encountered hard choice between patent and secret know-how.The seven free-of-charge IPR tools, useful in typical situations faced also by SMEs, such as requested cost prediction before applying for a patent, are explained and their benefits highlighted. The IPR training based on the demonstration of these tools and practical exercises using them is described and the lessons learnt by this approach are summarised.",

     "abstract": "In Malaysia, public universities and government research institutes (GRIs) are the main source for new technologies and innovations in the agricultural sector. Evidence shows that IP protection has become a norm for universities and GRIs throughout the world. The increased patenting and commercialization activity, however, brings with it concerns over limitation of the right for follow-up research, changes the norms of open-science and constrains open innovation in industry. The ensuing question is: will the increase in patenting activities by GRIs affect the patterns of knowledge transfer from the institute to the upstream, middle-stream and downstream industries? How do the GRIs decide which agricultural innovations are to be made available in the public domain and which are to be patented and made accessible for a fee?This paper first examines the central concerns surrounding open science in GRIs in relation to the output of R &D funded by the Malaysian government. The paper then explores the patent practice of the Malaysian Research Board (MRB) as a case study. MRB is chosen specifically as it is one of the oldest GRIs and the pioneer in patenting in Malaysia. Among the issues that are dealt with in this paper are: how does the Board balance its role in conducting research for the good of the society as opposed to claiming proprietary rights? How does the Board diffuse the R & D results to the small-scale farmers? What are the modes of commercialization adopted by them?The paper ends by suggesting that a balance between open science and patents must be maintained by the MRB in order to move the economy up the value chain.",

However, national offices remain important, especially for MNEs who mostly claim national priority first before filing at the EPO. Furthermore, we show that the choice of a filing route is associated with the outcome of the examination process.

For identifying patents related to cross-disciplinary or integrated technologies or products that are emerging and cannot be clearly defined through patent classes or no definite related patent class exists in the patent system, keyword search is an appropriate identification method. However, literature has not explicitly addressed the effectiveness evaluation of keyword search strategy for patent identification, namely which parts of patent information (title, abstract, claims and description) should be used and how to select effective keywords to achieve a high level of effectiveness. This paper tries to fill this gap through evaluating the effectiveness of keyword search strategies of using different parts of patent information with different clusters of keywords, in the case of automotive software related patents issued by the USPTO. Clusters of keywords are selected through evaluating the effectiveness of each keyword by measuring recall and precision. Effectiveness of keyword search strategies of using different parts of patent information is evaluated with the indicators of type I error (missing patents that should be identified) and type II error (retrieving irrelevant patents). The results show that the most effective method of identifying patents in a specific domain through keyword search is using the patent information in the title, abstract and claims. This paper provides a principle of keywords selection for patent identification by using specific criteria of recall and precision.",

Specifically, we extract textual and visual low-level features from patent images and train detectors, which are capable of identifying global concepts in patent figures. To evaluate this approach we have selected a dataset from the footwear domain and trained the concept detectors with different feature combinations. The results of the experiments show that the combination of textual and visual information of patent images demonstrates the best performance outperforming both single visual and textual features results. The outcome of this experiment provides a first evidence that concept detection can be applied in the domain of patent image retrieval and could be integrated in existing real world applications to support patent searching.",

Academics are found to contribute significantly to patenting activities in Europe, especially in science-based technologies such as Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology, followed by Chemicals & Materials, Measurement & Scientific Instruments, and Electrical Engineering & Electronics. Academic inventors appear to enjoy high academic status, as measured by their scientific productivity, and to occupy central positions in networks of inventors. Ongoing research on the value of academic patents, largely based on patent citation analysis, suggests that the latter are more original and general than non-academic ones, but unlikely to be more highly cited.",

Although information technology (IT) tools are a means to support the management of these portfolios, there is little insight in how firms actually make use of IT tools in this regard. Hence, this article analyzes how and for which processes firms use IT tools to support their IP management. Based on a data set of 106 IP intensive firms worldwide, we find that firms use at least one of three major IT tools for IP management: search tools, administrative tools, and evaluation tools. We also find that the use of IT for IP processes is decreasing along the IP value chain: firms use IT mainly in the early IP generation phase, e.g., for absorbing technological developments. The article concludes by outlining where and how IT tools can improve the management of IP.",

In the light of the EC Regulation 510/2006 relating to the protection of EU GIs, information about microbial resource management in GIs production is not unequivocally defined. We argue that it is possible to integrate the microbial resource information regimen coherently within the intellectual property framework for GIs. Product specification of GI fermented foods might comprise a list of autochthonous microbial strains representing the “virtuous” microbial biodiversity of a specific terroir and for a given method of food production. The autochthonous strains should be genotypically and technologically characterized and deposited in microbial collections. This approach will be useful in improving the “unique qualities” of products, and in ensuring a strong focus on the biological risks for human health and industrial exigencies of product standardization. Additionally, it is important to underline that a multi-strain starter culture essentially satisfies the patentable criteria.",

     "abstract": "Climate Change Mitigation Technologies (CCMTs) are becoming increasingly more important, both politically and economically. Having recognized this, the EPO cooperated with the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) and the International Centre on Trade and Sustainable Development (ICTSD) and produced a study on Patents and Clean Energy. To consolidate the efforts invested in this study, the Y02 patent classification was created. This is a tagging scheme developed by experienced examiners working in the relevant fields, in cooperation with external experts, for patent documents related to CCMTs, which provides additional classification next to the regular ECLA and IPC classification of such documents. Patent documents were tagged by means of search strategies by experienced expert examiners, which were formalized into algorithms that can be re-run periodically to update the classes. Currently there are 2 subclasses: Y02C (for Greenhouse gas capture and storage) and Y02E (CCMTs relating to energy generation, transmission or distribution). At the time of writing, over 650,000 documents have been tagged with Y02 codes. A comparison between published patent documents with Y02 tags and published patent documents in general confirms that over the last 15 years the annual amount of patents related to “clean energy” has grown more than twice as fast as the average of all patents. The Y02 codes are available and searchable through Espacenet or PATSTAT.",

A series of questions were asked on applicants’ R&D investment behaviour and numbers of worldwide first filings broken down by technical areas. Other factors were measured, including numbers of distinct inventions, the percentage of these that lead to patent applications and numbers of inventive staff.The results are weighted to infer the probability distributions of the attributes and two ratios of attributes. Two alternative weighting schemes are compared. A typical distribution for a variable that is correlated to applicant size (such as R&D expenditure) is extremely asymmetric. Frequency charts estimate the overall distributions across the EPO applicant population and are summarised by using means, medians and maxima. Breakdown analyses with representations on the frequency charts and statistical tables are made by four blocs of residence of the applicants and five industries.Conclusions are drawn about some of the characteristics of the EPO applicant population. Policy implications are mentioned and also how to move on to more extensive studies of this type, particularly to gain a better understanding of the asymmetric distribution of many attributes and their relationships to patenting. A crude estimate is made of 1 670 000 inventions worldwide that could have led to first filings in 2008.",

The main focus of the search has to be established: The how to search.And once the search starts, the initial main focus must be continuously revised and adapted in an iterative process in view of the intermediate search results obtained and, if necessary, all the previous criteria and strategies should be changed on the go, steering the search toward the best prior art in the shortest time possible.EPO examiners are trained to optimize the search using the above mentioned closed-loop iterative approach, with a continuous monitoring of the quality of the search results and a critical review of the initial search criteria.",

It is unrealistic to believe a marketing campaign which claims that a specific patent IR (information retrieval) system can find all relevant results for a search topic. And if we don’t trust marketing campaigns, how can we get an idea of what to expect from a patent search engine?One of the most prominent initiatives to work in this direction, of evaluating chemical IR tools, has started in 2009 with the support of NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technology): the TREC Chemical IR Track focuses on evaluation of search technologies for retrieval and knowledge discovery of digitally stored information on chemical patents and academic journal articles on chemistry.

     "abstract": "Biological patent analysts are often faced with querying multiple databases of sequence and text. After retrieving the query results, the results must be analyzed by reviewing patents and applications in a form of manual data reduction. Once families are identified for final analysis, the analyst must expand back out, looking at the members of those patent families. Again, sequence and text is reviewed manually, not algorithmically. One way for patent analysts to reduce the number of repetitive tasks performed is through the creation of macros. Such macros can be used for time-consuming tasks like global formatting, searching and replacing within a document, formatting extracted sequences into FASTA, or even converting three-letter amino acid code into single-letter code. Another way for a patent analyst to reduce repetitive tasks in biosequence patent analysis is through an alliance between biological patent analysts and bioinformaticians. Such an alliance could result in the development of tools that focus on these types of repetitive tasks. A bioinformatician is skilled in looking for solutions to various repetitive tasks. Such a solution could even be packaged and deployed to those colleagues who would benefit from access to such a time-saving program. Finding a way to automate repetitive tasks will free the patent analyst to spend more time on intellectual analysis of the results.",

The backlog at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is three times larger than one at the European Patent Office (EPO) and is essentially due to very low fees and a weak rigor of the examination process. The observed long pendency at the EPO is more due to applicants’ strategic filing behaviors that aim at delaying the grant date, as it marks the start of high expenses due to translation requirements and multiple validation or renewal fees. Since the root causes of backlogs diverge between EPO and USPTO, their cure should also be different.",

The market leader of the early adopter stage filed patent applications having more independent claims of which the claim category is ‘digital camera’ or the like compared to the rest of the participating firms, while the market leader of the late majority stage has more dependent claims. This indicates that it is critical to cover a maximal scope of the invention by plural independent claims in the early adopter stage, while, in the late majority stage in which the technologies are highly matured, the total number of dependent claims are increased to protect the market leader’s technologies against competitors and as a means of fallback options.",

This decline is also evident in its share of world scientific publications. These developments have been termed by some as the “American Paradox”. Extant research on R&D efficiency and technological innovation capability has considered the USA as a homogeneous entity and has not focused at the sub-national level. This paper analyses the R&D efficiency of 50 US states and the District of Columbia. R&D efficiency is calculated as the ratio of patents granted and scientific publications to R&D expenditures. Only 14 states out of the 51 regions are found to exhibit positive changes in R&D efficiency between 2004 and 2008. Comparing this performance with that of the BRICS nations over the same period we find that Brazil, India, China and South Korea show significant improvements in R&D efficiency with India taking the lead. This research identifies the states in the US with the highest R&D efficiency and presents benchmarks which can be followed by policy interventions. The paper highlights the importance of conducting analyses of R&D efficiency using patents and publications at the sub-national level for informed policy making.",

The creation of an effective single EU patent requires (i) English-only post-grant translation, (ii) the end of nationally granted patents, (iii) phasing-out of the current ‘European patent’, (iv) lower fees for young innovative companies, and (v) a radical shake-up of the governance of the European Patent Office.",

This paper, therefore, compares the structure of both patent applications at the Chinese national office and global applications by Chinese inventors. Moreover, it contrasts Chinese application activities with those of other nations. On this basis, it analyses if there is evidence of different underlying motivations for and logics of application that would substantiate such doubts. It concludes that, following WTO accession, the Chinese technology market is finding its specific equilibrium but retains certain persistent particularities.

Geographical indications are known to be the earliest type of trademarks. Historically, they have existed as long as, if not longer than, trademarks. GIs are intended to highlight special qualities of the products through indication of their origin. They also preserve cultural traditions and, therefore, are rightly associated with protection of traditional knowledge and community rights. Since the consumers appreciate quality goods, the use of GIs allows producers to obtain market recognition and a premium price for their goods. This is one of the reasons why adequate protection of this intellectual property type is required. In the EU, GIs for agricultural products and foodstuffs are protected by EC Regulation 510/2006. In order to be protected in accordance with the Regulation, GIs must be registered. This article briefly explains the nature and benefits of GIs, and explains in more detail the registration system in the EU for European and foreign GIs established by Regulation 510/2006.

Against this backcloth, the patenting and other activities of one Captain Cowper Coles, an obsessive but well connected inventor, are set out. He had 11 GB patents on the turreted and other designs of ships. His ability to influence people of substance, including Queen Victoria’s consort Prince Albert, eventually resulted in Coles receiving a contract to build the HMS Captain. This ship was so unstable that it sank in a modest storm in 1870, killing 480 of the 500 people on board, including Coles. Effective designs of steam warships with turreted guns were eventually achieved late in the 19th and early in the 20th century.",

The results are to a large extent rooted in a wider benchmarking analysis carried out on behalf of the European Commission as part of its ‘PRO INNO Europe activities’ the aim of which was to identify and benchmark all available IP-related support services in Europe and a number of overseas countries. For this paper, the relevant findings of the benchmarking study have been amended with an additional literature review and with an outline of the tool of semantic patent analysis. It is found that the competence of the operating staff, easy identification/visibility and timely delivery are among the most significant quality aspects from the point of view of the SMEs, while the geographical proximity of the SMEs to the service premises is a factor of less importance. Information needs of SMEs extend well beyond technical information on patents, and include interpretative help for search results but also IP management questions for decisions on why to use particular IP protection instruments in specific circumstances. The method of semantic patent analysis is described as one possible future option to extend the service activities of relevant information centres. However, provisions must be made in the governance of the (new and/or extended) services, and the reasoning for the need of the offerings should point to clear cases of market failure in order to avoid conflict with the private service sector.",

EPO internal, commercial, as well as some freeware tools are explained, including an evaluation of strengths and weaknesses.Emphasis is placed on how these catalysts are searched at the European Patent Office, i.e. patentability searches of patent applications.

     "abstract": "Information and meta-information related to national and international patents is a critical asset for every innovative company. The complexity of managing, searching, analyzing and relating such information to the needs of the company, in the different user tasks, is tackled by innovative knowledge management solutions, that aim at supporting the users in such daunting tasks.This paper aims at presenting a comprehensive and updated overview of patent information and of innovative solutions in patent informatics, in particular concerning intelligent and semantic solutions proposed in recent years. The analysis starts from the actual requirements of different types of users of patent information, and the typical information management tasks they require. Innovations, covering all the layers from data bases to algorithms to on-line services, are also critically presented and compared, and current research trends are outlined.",

     "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of various search strategies, methods and tools for searching catalysts comprising hydrides, coordination complexes or organic compounds. These are also commonly referred to as “homogeneous catalysts”, in contradistinction to true heterogeneous metal or metal oxide catalysts, typically on an inorganic support.The characteristic material and search aspects are illustrated by way of exemplary patent applications for catalysts/systems that find use in industrially important reactions such as hydroformylation, hydrocyanation, (asymmetric) hydrogenation, olefin metathesis, cross-coupling or come from emerging fields (e.g. C–H activation, “green chemistry”). EPO internal, commercial, as well as some freeware tools are explained, including an evaluation of strengths and weaknesses.Emphasis is placed on how these catalysts are searched at the European Patent Office, i.e. patentability searches of patent applications. Nevertheless, the information and evaluations provided herein should enable the reader to set up a strategy for any specific search problem in this field, including high precision (“quick”) and high recall clearance or validity searches.Additionally, much insight is provided on search methods at the EPO, databases etc, which can be of wider interest than catalyst searches alone.The paper is divided into two parts. This part (part 1) deals with terminology and the basics of patent searching, whereas part 2 in the next issue of this journal will deal with non-patent literature searching and the overall conclusions. See also the introduction for the distribution of content between the individual parts.",

     "abstract": "The aim of the paper is to contribute to a better knowledge of the existing relationship between the incorporation of technology and the industrial take-off, based on the case study of the sectoral dynamism of the Spanish industry during its period of highest development. The main hypothesis is that only an appropriate combination of the introduction of foreign technology and the creation of domestic technology guarantees the acquisition of the technological knowledge required for developing and less developed countries to reach a level closer to that of more developed countries. An evolutionary perspective has been applied considering that industrial growth depends on three types of variables: innovation or technology creation, dissemination potential and absorption capacity potential. The results confirm that the introduction of imported technology has been significant, both for unincorporated knowledge, shown in the growth of patents in the period 1960–1966, and that introduced through the importation of production technology by companies in the process of modernization.",
