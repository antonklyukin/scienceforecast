     "abstract": "A novel coupled-line-free wideband bandpass/bandstop filter configuration is designed and tested. The filter is based on a reentrant structure with unequal dielectric constants for the internal and external fillings. As a result, additional symmetrical transmission zeros are generated in the lower and upper stop bands of the bandpass filter; this leads to an elliptic function response and improvement of the pass band and selectivity. Similar conclusions are made about the bandstop filter in terms of the return loss. The general TEM circuit model, in terms of the two-port series connection, is presented for the proposed filters, and then, it is used to determine its electrical parameters. The experimental prototype was fabricated using conventional printed circuit board technology. The measured S-parameters show acceptable agreement with the analytical and full-wave simulations, showing promising potential for different applications.",

     "abstract": "In this paper, a supplier selection model was developed for a retailer. Suppliers have different influence factors that have a risk of profit loss or less profit as well as a loss of goodwill to a retailer. Thus, a retailer must choose a supplier that can provide better profit and better goodwill. Different suppliers have different business policies. Here, different risk factors and their corresponding severity in profit loss and goodwill loss are considered as a fuzzy number. Next, the total risk in profit loss and goodwill loss is formulated. To select a supplier with the minimum risk, a balanced solution of the soft set theory was applied to a numerical example.",

Basic generalized trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers considered for these arithmetic operations are formulated on the basis of ( α , β ) -cut methods. The ranking function of the generalized trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy number has been successively calculated. To validate the proposed arithmetic operations, we solved a type-2 intuitionistic fuzzy transportation problem by the ranking function for mean interval method.

In this paper, experimental studies and normalization and simulation by artificial neural network (ANN) were used. The results of the research have been applied to create a nonlinear relationship. All input and target data must be normalized and then simulation and training by a neural network can be performed. In this research, two layers have been used. One of these is a sigmoid layer. The results show that optimal connections in light weight steel framing systems have suitable plasticity, load capacity and nonlinear relations.

In the present era of climate change, it is necessary to understand the local impacts of such relationships. In this study, we attempted to portray local climate change using its altitudinal factor and fifteen years (2000–2014) of daily diurnal data from 20 stations in West Bengal, India that experienced increasing summer temperatures over the last several years. The study region is a combined zone of the plateau and plain region where there are variations in altitude. Further, the study used the ARMA model to forecast future climatic conditions of the region. The results demonstrate that climate change is playing an active role in the region, although there was not a convincing relationship between elevation and climate change. The low-lying counterparts of the study area were influenced by climate change. As per the forecast, the gap between the daily maximum and minimum temperatures will generally remain similar to or slightly less than the present conditions, while there is a high possibility of a more prominent decrease in the diurnal temperature range (DTR) over time.",

The leaf samples collected from the Bahla, Ad Dakliyah region were used for extraction by a maceration method using different organic solvents with increasing polarities. Biochemical screening was determined by established methods. The total phenol content and free radical scavenging activity were assessed by conventional Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (FCR) and α, α-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) methods. Biochemical screening of the crude extracts of neem leaves revealed positive results of flavonoids, saponins, steroids, alkaloids, amino acid and tannins. However, triterpenoid and anthraquinone were not detected in the crude extracts of neem leaves. The total phenol content of crude extracts from the leaves of the plant selected to be the gallic acid equivalent was found to be the highest in the ethyl acetate extract containing phenol compounds (3.58 g/100 g of dry powder) and the lowest in the water extract (0.42 g/100 g of dry powder). The highest antioxidant activity was found in the butanol extract and the lowest was in the hexane extract of the plant selected to be equivalent to DPPH.

One of the best ways to achieve these aims is using devices or robots instead of human resources. The injection pump we designed and manufactured in this work is a type of robot that has applications in medicine and health centres. This device is used for patients who are unable to receive foods and drugs orally. By examining similar foreign devices in Ardebil health centres, studying their advantages and disadvantages, and researching health centre requirements for these devices, we designed and constructed such a device for the first time in this country. The most important items achieved in these investigations include time, accuracy, speed of drug injection and cost reduction. The shortest time we achieved using this device was approximately 6 s for 1 cc of drug or fluid. We also calculated the speed of injection for 1 cc of drug to be approximately 0.17 cc per second, which was an ideal value compared to that of similar foreign devices. In comparison to the cost of similar foreign devices, our device has a lower cost due to simplicity and high performance. To achieve these results, we designed a new device engine. In this design we used a three-step engine that has a different algorithm than similar devices. In this engine, every cc was injected in 2000 steps of the engine, and each step was 3 ms, achieving 6 s for each cc of injection.",

In this methodology, a suitable ranking function is defined to establish an order relation between two TIFNs, and the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy (I-fuzzy) inequalities is interpreted. Utilizing these inequality relations and ranking functions, a pair of linear programming models is derived from a pair of auxiliary intuitionistic fuzzy programming models. Based on the aspiration levels, this pair of linear programming models is solved to determine the optimal strategies for both players of the game. The proposed method in this paper is illustrated with a voting share problem to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the method.",

Interval valued intuitionistic models provide more precision, flexibility, and compatibility to a system than do classic fuzzy models. In this paper, three new types of product operations (direct product, lexicographic product, and strong product) of interval valued intuitionistic (S,T)–fuzzy graphs are defined. One of the most studied classes of fuzzy graphs are regular fuzzy graphs, which appear in many contexts. For example, r-regular fuzzy graphs with connectivity and edge-connectivity equal to r play a key role in designing reliable communication networks. Hence, we introduced the concepts of regular and totally regular interval valued intuitionistic (S,T)–fuzzy graphs. Likewise, we defined busy vertices and free vertices in interval valued intuitionistic (S,T)–fuzzy graphs and studied their images under an isomorphism, which are highly important in fuzzy social networks.",

Mathematical modelling of the membrane-based gas separation process can be useful to predict the performance of such separation processes. An improved mathematical model has been implemented in this research for the separation of a binary gas mixture using a membrane separator. The finite difference method (FDM) is applied to predict the membrane gas separation behaviour. The method is helpful as it involves the least effort and computational time because algebraic equations are used instead of differential equations. Different configurations, such as single stage and double stage, are used in this study. The results of the FDM simulation are compared with the simulation results of the model and the experimental data of several membrane systems.",

Different extracts were prepared by Soxhlet extraction with methanol of powdered samples of either leaves or fruit. Both extracts were separately suspended in water and fractionated using solvents of different polarities, namely, hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol, methanol and water, in an increasing polarity pattern. The different parameters mentioned above were determined using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (FCR), aluminium chloride (AlCl3) and 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) methods, as applied to each assay. The maximum content of total phenols in leaves was detected in the ethyl acetate extract, and the lowest was in the water extract. A similar result was also obtained from fruit extracts of Ziziphus jujube. However, the maximum content of flavonoids was detected in chloroform extract, and the minimum content was observed in hexane extract, with a similar trend being observed for total flavonoids content in the case of fruit extracts. Both the leaf and fruit extracts exhibited significant antioxidant activity, with the maximum percentage of inhibition being obtained in chloroform and hexane extracts and the lowest inhibition in the ethyl acetate extract.

Providing a perfect seismic Health Safety Environment (HSE) index has always been regarded as one of the analytical passive points. In this research, an LSF building was selected as a case study for Finite Element (FE) modelling, in which non-linear time-history analyses were undertaken. Material properties were defined according to the performed experimental studies. A novel approach was presented for the seismic HSE index of LSF systems using the simultaneous incorporation of the non-linear analysis results and the correction coefficient describing the seismic geotechnical effects. The presented seismic HSE index accurately demonstrates the seismic performance of the LSF structures. Additionally, a two-layer perceptron Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was trained using the results of the FE model, and a non-linear relationship was obtained to predict the seismic damage index. Finally, the proposed seismic HSE index was validated using statistical analyses, indicating that the proposed method does not yield a significant difference compared to the ANN results.",

The formation of HPGs in PDLCs is possible due to the light-induced periodic spatial inhomogeneity of the optical anisotropy of the material caused by the superposition of two plane coherent orthogonally polarized waves on the sample plane (under the influence of the photo-induced Fredericks effect), which is stabilized as a result of the phase separation of the PDLC components during the photopolymerization process.

     "abstract": "The theoretical concepts of graphs are highly utilized by computer science applications, social sciences, and medical sciences, especially in computer science for applications such as data mining, image segmentation, clustering, image capturing, and networking. Fuzzy graphs, bipolar fuzzy graphs and the recently developed m-polar fuzzy graphs are growing research topics because they are generalizations of graphs (crisp). In this paper, three new operations, i.e., direct product, semi-strong product and strong product, are defined on m-polar fuzzy graphs. It is proved that any of the products of m-polar fuzzy graphs are again an m-polar fuzzy graph. Sufficient conditions are established for each to be strong, and it is proved that the strong product of two complete m-polar fuzzy graphs is complete. If any of the products of two m-polar fuzzy graphs G1 and G2 are strong, then at least G1 or G2 must be strong. Moreover, the density of an m-polar fuzzy graph is defined, the notion of balanced m-polar fuzzy graph is studied, and necessary and sufficient conditions for the preceding products of two m-polar fuzzy balanced graphs to be balanced are established. Finally, the concept of product m-polar fuzzy graph is introduced, and it is shown that every product m-polar fuzzy graph is an m-polar fuzzy graph. Some operations, like union, direct product, and ring sum are defined to construct new product m-polar fuzzy graphs.",

     "abstract": "The concentration of phytoplankton is often used to assess the ecological status of water bodies; it is determined by the fluorescence intensity of chlorophyll-a, which is located in microalgae cells. Investigators do not usually take into account the effect of the medium on the fluorescence intensity when determining the concentration of phytoplankton. This article describes the use of a fibre-optic spectrometer developed by the authors to identify the relationship between the fluorescence of the chlorophyll-a in phytoplankton cells and under environmental conditions, such as temperature and illumination. A mathematical model is used to calculate the chlorophyll-a concentration based on fluorescence measurements and takes the temperature and amount of light into account. Using the resulting proportionality coefficient can reduce the error in the chlorophyll-a concentration determined using fluorescence methods by a factor of two. In this article the, authors describe the results of applying the method they developed to performance monitoring in the waters of the Gulf of Peter the Great in September and October 2013.",
