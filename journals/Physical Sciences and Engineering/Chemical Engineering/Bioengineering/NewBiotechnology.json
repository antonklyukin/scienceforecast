     "abstract": "Fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) mixtures produced by fermentation contain large amounts of non-prebiotic sugars. Here we propose a mixed culture of Aureobasidium pullulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to produce FOS and consume the small saccharides simultaneously, thereby increasing FOS purity in the mixture. The use of immobilised A. pullulans in co-culture with encapsulated S. cerevisiae, inoculated after 10 h fermentation, enhanced FOS production in a 5 L bioreactor. Using this strategy, a maximal FOS concentration of 119 g L−1, and yield of 0.59 gFOS gsucrose−1, were obtained after 20 h fermentation, increasing FOS productivity from about 4.9 to 5.9 gFOS L−1 h−1 compared to a control fermentation of immobilized A. pullulans in monoculture. In addition, the encapsulated S. cerevisiae cells were able to decrease the glucose in the medium to about 7.6% (w/w) after 63 h fermentation. This provided a final fermentation mixture with 2.0% (w/w) sucrose and a FOS purity of over 67.0% (w/w). Moreover, a concentration of up to 58.0 g L−1 of ethanol was obtained through the enzymatic transformation of glucose. The resulting pre-purified FOS mixture could improve the separation and purification of FOS in downstream treatments, such as simulated moving bed chromatography.",

In this study, rayon fibers were enzymatically hydrolyzed to allow recovery of glucose and valuable additives. The glucose was successfully used as carbon source for the production of high value compounds such as itaconic acid, lactic acid and chitosan. 14.2 g/L of itaconic acid, 36.5 g/L of lactic acid and 39.2 g/L of chitosan containing biomass were produced from Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus paracasei and Aspergillus niger, respectively, comparable to yields obtained when using commercial glucose as carbon source.",

     "abstract": "The need to develop competitive and eco-friendly processes in the cosmetic industry leads to the search for new enzymes with improved properties for industrial bioconversions in this sector. In the present study, a complete methodology to generate, express and screen diversity for the type C feruloyl esterase from Fusarium oxysporium FoFaeC was set up in a high-throughput fashion. A library of around 30,000 random mutants of FoFaeC was generated by error prone PCR of fofaec cDNA and expressed in Yarrowia lipolytica. Screening for enzymatic activity towards the substrates 5-bromo-4-chloroindol-3-yl and 4-nitrocatechol-1-yl ferulates allowed the selection of 96 enzyme variants endowed with improved enzymatic activity that were then characterized for thermo- and solvent- tolerance. The five best mutants in terms of higher activity, thermo- and solvent- tolerance were selected for analysis of substrate specificity. Variant L432I was shown to be able to hydrolyze all the tested substrates, except methyl sinapate, with higher activity than wild type FoFaeC towards methyl p-coumarate, methyl ferulate and methyl caffeate. Moreover, the E455D variant was found to maintain completely its hydrolytic activity after two hour incubation at 55 °C, whereas the L284Q/V405I variant showed both higher thermo- and solvent- tolerance than wild type FoFaeC. Small molecule docking simulations were applied to the five novel selected variants in order to examine the binding pattern of substrates used for enzyme characterization of wild type FoFaeC and the evolved variants.",

     "publication date": "07-2019",
     "abstract": "Bioleaching of metal sulfides represents an interfacial process where biofilm formation is important in the initial steps of this process. In technical applications of bioleaching, such as reactor leaching in the temperature range of 50 up to 90 °C and also in (self-heating) heaps, thermophilic archaea play an important role and often are the leaching organisms of choice. Nevertheless, to date there is little information available on the interactions between thermoacidophilic archaea and their natural mineral substrates such as pyrite. Especially for extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of archaea and their biofilms in bioleaching environments information is rather limited. The present work focused on investigations of biofilm dynamics and EPS production of the thermoacidophilic archaeon Acidianus sp. DSM 29099 under bioleaching conditions. The results show that biofilms are dispersed non-homogeneously on pyrite. Large parts of the pyrite surfaces remain free of cells. Cell detachment from pyrite results in microbial “footprints” which, based on lectin binding assays, consist of mannose, glucose and fucose containing compounds. A monolayer biofilm develops on pyrite after 2–4 days of incubation. In addition, the pyrite surface is covered with a layer of organic compounds. EPS analysis indicates the presence of proteins, polysaccharides and uronic acids, the composition of which varies according to substrate and lifestyle (i.e. planktonic, biofilm cells). This report provides insight into EPS and biofilm characteristics of thermophilic archaea and improves understanding of the mineral-microbial-biofilm interfacial interactions in extreme environments. Moreover, the results on interaction dynamics of archaeal microbial consortia will facilitate the understanding of thermophilic bioleaching.",

     "abstract": "There has been growing interest in the use of microalgae for the production of biofuels, but production costs continue to be too high to compete with fossil fuel prices. One of the main limitations for photobioreactor productivity is light shielding, especially at high cell densities. The growth of the green microalga Chlorella sorokiniana, a robust industrial species, has been evaluated under different trophic conditions with traditional carbon sources, such as glucose and sucrose, and alternative low cost carbon sources, such as carob pod extract, industrial glycerol and acetate-rich oxidized wine waste lees. The mixotrophic cultivation of this microalga with wine waste lees alleviated the problems of light shielding observed in photoautotrophic cultures, improving specific growth rate (0.052 h-1) compared with the other organic sources. The fed-batch mixotrophic culture of Chlorella sorokiniana in a 2 L stirred tank reactor, with optimized nutritional conditions, 100 mM of acetate coming from the oxidized wine waste lees and 30 mM of ammonium, produced an algal biomass concentration of 11 g L-1 with a lipid content of 38 % (w/w). This fed-batch strategy has been found to be a very effective means to enhance the biomass and neutral lipid productivity.",

     "publication date": "07-2019",
     "abstract": "Guar gum consists mainly of galactomannan and constitutes the endosperm of guar seeds that acts as a reserve polysaccharide for germination. Due to its molecular structure and physical properties, this biopolymer has been considered as one of the most important and widely used gums in industry. However, for many of these applications this (hemi-)cellulosic structure needs to be modified or (partially) depolymerized in order to customize and improve its physicochemical properties. In this study, transcriptome, exoproteome and enzyme activity analyses were employed to decipher the complete enzymatic arsenal for guar gum depolymerization by Aspergillus niger. This multi-omic analysis revealed a set of 46 genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) responding to the presence of guar gum, including CAZymes not only with preferred activity towards galactomannan, but also towards (arabino-)xylan, cellulose, starch and pectin, likely due to trace components in guar gum. This demonstrates that the purity of substrates has a strong effect on the resulting enzyme mixture produced by A. niger and probably by other fungi as well, which has significant implications for the commercial production of fungal enzyme cocktails.",

     "abstract": "AID/APOBEC3 enzymes are cytidine deaminases that mutate antibody and retroviral genes and also mediate extensive tumor genome mutagenesis. The study of purified AID/APOBEC3 proteins is challenged by difficulties with their expression and purification arising from genotoxicity in expression hosts, extensive non-specific protein-protein/DNA/RNA interactions and haphazard oligomerization. To date, expression hosts for purification of AID/APOBEC3 enzymes include bacteria, insect and mammalian cells. Here the establishment and optimization of a yeast expression/secretion system for AID/APOBEC3s are reported, followed by comparison with the same enzymes expressed in bacterial and mammalian hosts. AID and APOBEC3G were expressed successfully in Pichia pastoris, each either with an N-terminal GST tag, C-terminal V5-His tag or as untagged native form. It was verified that the yeast-expressed enzymes exhibit identical biochemical properties to those reported using bacterial and mammalian expression, indicating high fidelity of protein folding. It was demonstrated that the system can be adapted for secretion of the enzymes into the media which was used directly in various enzyme assays. The system is also amenable to elimination of bulky fusion tags, providing native untagged enzymes. Thus, P. pastoris is an advantageous expression factory for AID/APOBEC3 enzymes, considering the cost, time, efficiency and quality of the obtained enzymes. The first report is also provided here of a functionally active, untagged, secreted AID, which may become a useful research reagent. A comprehensive comparison is made of the effect of fusion tags and expression hosts on the biochemical actions of AID and APOBEC3G.",

     "publication date": "07-2019",
     "abstract": "The comparatively low adoption rate of GMO products in the European Union (EU) market seems to be connected with the strictness of authorization regulations and inefficiency of the authorization process itself. These problems will apply to any product deemed to be a GMO that could potentially be marketable in the EU. Since modern methods of plant breeding involving oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (ODMs) or site-directed nucleases (SDNs), including Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR), are becoming ever more popular, it is crucial to establish whether the products of such new breeding techniques (NBTs), in particular those which involve precise methods of mutagenesis, are exempted from the EU legislation on GMOs or not. Legal uncertainty as to their status may result in reluctance to invest in such methods and develop them further. Here, developments are presented in the legal classification of certain NBTs products in the context of recent decisions and jurisprudence. The socioeconomic aspects of GMO adoption in both global and European contexts are discussed. The legal and practical landscape of GMO regulation in the EU is presented and how it may pose an obstacle to investment and the development of new products. The latest jurisprudence (e.g., Case C-528/16) [1] on the interpretation of the legal concept of GMOs and the scope of the legislation are analyzed, with the conclusion that the strict regulations will probably also apply to products of the NBTs involving precise methods of mutagenesis. This in turn will probably result in the restriction of their application in the development of new plant varieties in the EU.",

     "abstract": "Among bioactive peptides, cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also referred to as host defence peptides (HDPs), are valuable tools to treat infections, being able to kill a wide variety of microbes directly and/or modulate host immunity. HDPs have great therapeutic potential against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, viruses and even parasites. However, high manufacturing costs have greatly limited their development as drugs, thus highlighting the need to develop novel and competitive production strategies. Here, a cost-effective procedure was established to produce the high amounts of peptides required for basic and clinical research. Firstly, a novel culture medium was designed, which was found to support significantly higher cell densities and recombinant expression levels of peptides under test compared to conventional media. The procedure has been also efficiently scaled up by using a 5 L fermenter, while the costs have been lowered significantly by developing a successful auto-induction strategy, which has been found to support higher yields of target constructs and cell biomass compared to conventional strategies based on expression induction by IPTG. Interestingly, it was estimated that by increasing production scale from 100 to 1000 mg/batch, unit costs decreased strongly from 253 to 42 €/mg. These costs appear highly competitive when compared to chemical synthesis strategies. Altogether, the data indicate that the strategy represents an important starting point for the future development of large-scale manufacture of HDPs.",

     "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2018.12.004",
     "publication date": "05-2019",
     "abstract": "The blockage of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway at the orotidine-5′-phosphate decarboxylase level was previously demonstrated to affect riboflavin production in the industrial producer fungus Ashbya gossypii. However, the molecular basis for the unusual sensitivity to uracil displayed by the pyrimidine auxotroph A. gossypii Agura3 was unknown. Here, uridine was shown to be the only intermediate of the pyrimidine salvage pathway able to fully restore this mutant’s growth. Conversely, uracil, which is routinely used to rescue pyrimidine auxotrophs, had a dose-dependent growth-inhibitory effect. Uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) is the pyrimidine salvage pathway enzyme responsible for converting uracil to uridine monophosphate in the presence of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP). Characterization of the A. gossypii UPRT, as produced and purified from Escherichia coli, revealed that uracil concentrations above 1 mM negatively affected its activity, thus explaining the hypersensitivity of the Agura3 mutant to uracil. Accordingly, overexpression of the AgUPRT encoding-gene in A. gossypii Agura3 led to similar growth on rich medium containing 5 mM uracil or uridine. Decreased UPRT activity ultimately favors the preservation of PRPP, which otherwise may be directed to other pathways. In A. gossypii, increased PRPP availability promotes overproduction of riboflavin. Thus, this UPRT modulation mechanism reveals a putative means of saving precursors essential for riboflavin overproduction by this fungus. A similar uracil-mediated regulation mechanism of the UPRT activity is reported only in two protozoan parasites, whose survival depends on the availability of PRPP. Physiological evidence here discussed indicate that it may be extended to other distantly related flavinogenic fungi.",

     "abstract": "Benzohydroxamic acids, such as DIBOA (2,4-dihydroxy-2 H)-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4 H)-one), are plant products that exhibit interesting herbicidal, fungicidal and bactericidal properties. A feasible alternative to their purification from natural sources is the synthesis of analogous compounds such as D-DIBOA (2-deoxy-DIBOA) and their chlorinated derivatives. Their chemical synthesis has been simplified into two steps. However, the second step is an exothermic reaction and involves hydrogen release, which makes this methodology expensive and difficult to scale up. The study reported here concerns the possibility of producing chlorobenzoxazinones by a whole-cell biocatalytic process using the ability of the engineered E. coli nfsB–/pBAD-NfsB to catalyse the synthesis of 6-Cl-D-DIBOA and 8-Cl-D-DIBOA from their respective precursors (PCs). The results show that this strain is able to grow in media that contain these compounds and to produce the target molecules with 59.3% and 46.7% biotransformation yields, respectively. Moreover, the strain is capable of processing non-purified PCs from the first chemical step to give similar yields to those obtained from the purified PCs. The kinetics of the reaction in vitro with purified recombinant NfsB nitroreductase were studied to characterise the catalysis further and evaluate the effects that several components of the non-purified PCs have on the process. The results revealed that the kinetics are that of an allosteric enzyme. The inhibitory effect of the substrate of the first step of the chemical synthesis, which is present in some non-purified PCs, was also demonstrated.",

     "abstract": "IgM antibodies are arousing considerable interest as biopharmaceuticals. Despite their immunotherapeutic potential, little is known about the impact of environmental conditions on product quantity and quality of these complex molecules. Process conditions influence the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of therapeutic proteins and thus are important parameters for biological safety and efficacy. Here, the results of a systematic study are presented that characterized the influence of temperature and pH on cell-specific productivity and IgM quality attributes. Biphasic temperature and pH shift experiments were performed as batch cultures in DASGIP® bioreactors under controlled conditions and defined by a specific design of experiment (DOE) approach. An internally-developed recombinant IgM producing CHO cell line was used. With respect to product quality, after an initial purification step efforts were focused on pentamer content, nucleic acid (NA) impurities and the glycosylation profile after an initial purification step. All quality attributes were evaluated by densitometric and chromatographic methods. The reduction of cultivation temperature severely reduced IgM titers, while pH variation had no impact. In contrast, IgM quality was not significantly influenced by bioprocessing parameters. Data revealed that an additional purification step is required to reduce the presence of NAs for in vivo applications. In conclusion, the results showed that for the chosen IgM model, IgM012_GL, variation in quality attributes is not caused by the environmental conditions of temperature and pH.",

The Lambertella sp. isolate displayed the highest percentages of oxidation of diesel oil and was characterised by the capacity to utilise the latter as a sole carbon source. This isolate showed extracellular laccase and Mn-peroxidase activities in the presence of diesel oil. It was tested for capacity to accelerate the process of decontamination of total petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated sediments, co-composted with lignocellulosic residues and was able to promote the degradation of 47.6% of the TPH contamination (54,074 ± 321 mg TPH/Kg of sediment) after two months of incubation.

     "abstract": "Mixed microbial cultures are a viable means for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production, which can produce polymers of commercial quality with high yields. Various PHA co-polymer blends can be produced by surplus full-scale municipal activated sludge fed with fermented waste feedstocks. In biological nutrient removal, ammonia is converted to nitrate by ammonia and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (AOBs and NOBs) through nitrification and removed as nitrogen gas through denitrification. Activated sludge can be enriched with significant PHA storage potential alongside nitrogen removal by denitrifying heterotrophic and nitrifying autotrophic bacteria. The latter adds complexity and aeration demand during the aerobic side-stream PHA accumulation stage since fermented organic residuals often contain significant amounts of ammonia. In the present work, the influence of dissolved oxygen (DO) levels on both PHA accumulation and nitrification rates for a municipal activated sludge were evaluated. The objective was to identify potential for a DO control strategy for PHA accumulation, which would mitigate the unnecessary nitrification activity during PHA production. A much higher apparent Michaelis–Menten DO affinity for volatile fatty acid (VFA) consumption (KDO _VFA 0.1 ± 0.06 mg/L) was found as compared to nitrification (KDO _NH4 2.87 ± 1.31 mg/L). Consequently, with lower DO levels, PHA production was not limited by oxygen supply, while nitrogen was removed by simultaneous nitrification and denitrification processes. This study suggests a method for PHA accumulation using nitrifying activated sludge, while feeding ammonia-containing organic feedstocks by means of DO level control where: (1) NOB activity and growth are both mitigated, (2) nitrogen removal is facilitated, (3) alkalinity is controlled through simultaneous denitrification, and (4) energy demand for aeration is reduced.",

Three reactor systems, namely stirred tank reactors equipped with either Rushton turbines or marine impeller and draft tube (STR and STR-MD, respectively) and an air-lift reactor (ALR) were compared for this purpose. Although inocula were supplied as intact pellets, in both STR-based systems fungal growth evolved rapidly into a dispersed form while the ALR enabled the maintenance of the pellet growth mode. STR was deemed to be the most promising system since it best supported the production MnP activity on the HMW-OMW-based medium and its performance in laccase production did not differ from that observed with the STR-MD. Among the stirring regimes considered (250, 400, 500 and 600 rpm), the best production in the STR was observed at 500 rpm and 1.0 vvm for both laccase (8850 ± 270 IU L−1 on day 15) and MnP (17,027.4 ± 87.2 IU L-1 on day 13). When the inocula were supplied to the STR in homogenized form, the MnP production peak (16,856 ± 1070 IU L-1) was attained 8 days earlier than the previous condition and that of laccase was nearly doubled (14,967 ± 907 IU L-1).

Nonetheless, the reduced number of carbon atoms and the symmetry of the glycerol molecule has hampered the comprehensive determination of metabolic fluxes when used as the labelled C-source. Moreover, metabolic models typically used for 13C-based flux balance analysis may be incomplete or misrepresent the actual metabolic network. To circumvent these limitations, we reduced the genome-scale metabolic model iMT1026-v3.0 into a core model and used it for the iterative fitting of metabolic fluxes to the measured mass isotope distribution of proteinogenic amino acids obtained after fractional 13C labelling of cells with [1,3-13C]-glycerol. This workflow allows reliable estimates to be obtained for in vivo fluxes in P. pastoris cells growing on glycerol as sole carbon source, as well as revising previous assumptions concerning its metabolic operation, such as alternative metabolic branches, calculation of energetic parameters and proposed specific cofactor utilisation.",

Upon three increasingly selective ribosome display iterations, selected variants were identified by next generation sequencing (NGS). Nine affibody variants with high relative abundance bearing QRP and QLH amino acid motifs at residues 9–11 were produced and characterized in terms of stability, affinity and specificity. All affibodies were correctly folded, with affinities ranging from 0.04 to 2 μM towards CTX-M15, and successfully recognized CTX-M15 in bacterial lysates, culture supernatants and on whole bacteria. It was further demonstrated that the binding of affibody molecules to CTX-M15 modulated the enzyme’s kinetic parameters.

     "abstract": "Microorganisms are present in oil reservoirs around the world where they degrade oil and lead to changes in oil quality. Unfortunately, our knowledge about processes in deep oil reservoirs is limited due to the lack of undisturbed samples. In this review, we discuss the distribution of microorganisms at the oil-water transition zone as well as in water saturated parts of the oil leg and their possible physiological adaptations to abiotic and biotic ecological factors such as temperature, salinity and viruses. We show the importance of studying the water phase within the oil, because small water inclusions and pockets within the oil leg provide an exceptional habitat for microorganisms within a natural oil reservoir and concurrently enlarge the zone of oil biodegradation. Environmental factors such as temperature and salinity control oil biodegradation. Temperature determines the type of microorganisms which are able to inhabit the reservoir. Proteobacteria and Euryarchaeota, are ubiquitous in oil reservoirs over all temperature ranges, whereas some others are tied to specific temperatures. It is proposed that biofilm formation is the dominant way of life within oil reservoirs, enhancing nutrient uptake, syntrophic interactions and protection against environmental stress. Literature shows that viruses are abundant in oil reservoirs and the possible impact on microbial community composition due to control of microbial activity and function is discussed.",

The 1953 bp lmco gene sequence comprises of 3 exons interrupted by 2 introns and according to the LccED database the translated sequence belongs to superfamily 6 of multicopper oxidases. After removal of the introns, the gene was transformed into Pichia pastoris, under the control of the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter. The heterologous enzyme was purified with an apparent molecular weight of 80 kDa. TtLMCO1 displayed optimum activity at pH 4 and 50 °C and appeared thermostable up to 50 °C. A variety of phenolic compounds were oxidized by TtLMCO1, including standard laccase substrates such as ABTS and 2,6 dimethoxyphenol. The UV/Vis spectrum of purified TtLMCO1 indicates that it belongs to yellow laccase-like oxidases. The enzyme was used for the bioconversion of 2′,3,4-trihydroxychalcone to 3′,4′-dihydroxy-aurone, a bioactive aurone recently shown to possess inhibitory activity against several isoforms of the histone deacetylase complex (HDAC).

Response surface methodology - central composite design was used to evaluate the effect of inexpensive and widely available nutrient sources, namely molasses, ethanol, corn steep liquor (CSL) and ammonium sulphate, on BNC production yield. The optimized parameters for maximum BNC production were % (m/v): molasses 5.38, CSL 1.91, ammonium sulphate 0.63, disodium phosphate 0.270, citric acid 0.115 and ethanol 1.38% (v/v). The experimental and predicted maximum BNC production yields were 7.5 ± 0.54 g/L and 6.64 ± 0.079 g/L, respectively and the experimental and predicted maximum BNC productivity were 0.829 ± 0.046 g/L/day and 0.734 ± 0.079 g/L/day, after 9 days of static culture fermentation, at 30 °C. The effect of surface area and culture medium depth on production yield and productivity were also studied. BNC dry mass production increased linearly with surface area, medium depth and fermentation time. So long as nutrients were still available in the culture media, BNC mass productivity was constant. The results show that a high BNC production yield can be obtained by static culture of K. xylinus BPR 2001 using a low-cost medium. These are promising conditions for the static industrial scale BNC production, since as compared to agitated bioreactors, higher productivities may be reached, while avoiding high capital and operating costs.",

     "abstract": "The capacities for thermal and inhibitor tolerance are critical for industrial enzymes and loss of activity is a major challenge in deploying natural enzymes for commercial applications. Protein engineering approaches, such as site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution, have been devoted to modifying natural enzymes. Recently, a post-translation protein engineering strategy, the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system, was introduced. Here, we have generated a thermo- and ion-tolerant cyclized xylanase (C-TFX) by fusing the SpyTag and SpyCatcher peptides to its N- and C- terminus respectively. Compared with the linear enzyme, C-TFX retained greater residual activity after heating or metal ion exposure. Intrinsic ﬂuorescence and circular dichroism analysis revealed that the isopeptide bond mediated by SpyTag/SpyCatcher cyclization contributed to enhanced thermo- and ion-stability, probably by stabilizing its secondary and conformational structure. In addition, the heat-challenged C-TFX was observed to degrade natural lignocellulosic substrates efficiently. The cyclized xylanase was more stable and resistent to denaturation and aggregation than the linear enzyme. The “superglue” SpyTag/SpyCatcher cyclization system enables the enzyme to maintain its structural conformation, which will be of particular interest in engineering of enzymes for industrial application such as feed additives and functional oligosaccharides production.",

Using a size-based microfluidic device, we show that the majority (>90%) of CTCs isolated from the blood of patients with metastatic bladder and colorectal cancers express the STn antigen, supporting a link with metastasis. STn+ CTC counts were significantly higher than EpCAM-based detection in colorectal cancer, providing a more efficient cell-surface biomarker for CTC isolation. Exploring this concept, we constructed a glycan affinity-based microfluidic device for selective isolation of STn+ CTCs and propose an enzyme-based strategy for the recovery of viable cancer cells for downstream investigations. Finally, clinically relevant cancer biomarkers (transcripts and mutations) in bladder and colorectal tumours, were identified in cells isolated by microfluidics, confirming their malignant origin and highlighting the potential of this technology in the context of precision oncology.",

     "abstract": "Polyethyleneimine (PEI) has been used extensively for transient gene expression (TGE) in mammalian cell cultures. However, the relationship between DNA/PEI complex preparation and their biological activity has not been fully established. Here, a systematic study of DNA/PEI complexes, their physicochemical properties during formation and their transfection efficiency was performed on a virus-like particle (VLP) production platform. The same chemically defined cell culture medium for DNA/PEI complex formation was used as an alternative to simple ionic solutions to minimize changes in complex properties during transfection. Upon formation, an initial concentration of 1E + 10 DNA/PEI complexes/mL underwent partial aggregation with an average size of 300 nm. The participation of NaCl ions in the evolution of complexes was analyzed by X-ray spectroscopy, stressing the relevance of complexing media composition in TGE strategies. After 15 min incubation, 250 complexes plus aggregates per cell were estimated at the time of transfection. Such heterogeneous preparations cannot be easily characterized; subsequently, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and cryo-electron microscopy were combined to achieve a complete picture of the preparation. Finally, the contribution of each DNA/PEI complex subpopulation was tested by drug inhibition endocytosis. Interestingly, all complexes delivered DNA efficiently and high size aggregates, which enter through macropinocytosis, when inhibited presented a major contribution to transfection efficiency. There is a need to understand the physicochemical factors that participate in DNA delivery protocols. Hence, this study provides new insights into the characterization of DNA/PEI complexes that will assist in more productive and reproducible TGE strategies.",

Enzymatic routes to NTPs from simple building blocks are attractive, however the cost and complexity of assembling the requisite mixtures of multiple enzymes hinders application. Here, we describe the use of an engineered E. coli cell-free lysate as an efficient readily-prepared multi-enzyme biocatalyst for the production of uridine triphosphate (UTP) from free ribose and nucleobase. Endogenous lysate enzymes are able to support the nucleobase ribosylation and nucleotide phosphorylation steps, while uridine phosphorylation and the production of ribose phosphates (ribose 1-phosphate, ribose 5-phosphate and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate) require recombinant enrichment of endogenous activities. Co-expression vectors encoding all required recombinant enzymes were employed for host cell transformation, such that a cell-free lysate with all necessary activities was obtained from a single bacterial culture. ATP required as phosphorylation cofactor was recycled by endogenous lysate enzymes using cheap, readily-prepared acetyl phosphate. Surprisingly, acetyl phosphate initiated spontaneous generation of ATP in the lysate, most likely from the breakdown of endogenous pools of adenosine-containing starting materials (e.g. adenosine cofactors, ribonucleic acids). The sub-stoichiometric amount of ATP produced and recycled in this way was enough to support all ATP-dependent steps without addition of any exogenous cofactor or auxiliary enzyme. Using this approach, equimolar solutions of orotic acid and ribose are transformed near quantitatively into 1.4 g L−1 UTP within 2.5 h, using a low-cost, readily-generated biocatalytic preparation.",

Previous work showed the possibility of obtaining a photo-EBPR system starting from a culture already enriched in polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs). The present work evaluated whether the same could be achieved starting from conventional activated sludge. A sequencing batch reactor inoculated with sludge from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was fed with a mixture of acetate and propionate (75%:25%) and subjected to dark/light cycles to select a photo-EBPR system containing PAOs and photosynthetic organisms, the oxygen providers for the system. The results showed that it is possible to obtain a photo-EBPR system starting from a WWTP sludge, although the process is slower than when started with a sludge already enriched in PAOs. After 15 days of operation, the system could remove 60 ± 2 mg-P/L of phosphorus (approximately 67% of the concentration at the end of dark period) in the light period, from which 13 ± 1 mg-P/L was removed during the phase without external air supply. These results indicate that a photo-EBPR system can be obtained independently of the seed sludge initially used, provided that a suitable operating strategy is implemented, i.e. by imposing conditions that favour the growth and coexistence of PAOs and photosynthetic microorganisms.",

To understand the effect of amino acids, E. coli B and K were grown at a steady state of 0.35 h−1 in glucose minimal medium with and without amino acids, while their metabolism, protein abundance and gene expression were compared. The results showed that amino acids promoted higher acetate excretion, higher fatty acid biosynthesis (K strain), repressed glucose uptake rate, and decreased expression of proteins associated with the TCA cycle, glyoxylate shunt and amino acid biosynthesis. In presence of amino acids, E. coli K upregulated fatty acid biosynthesis and repressed more genes and proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis than E. coli B. These findings are correlated with higher yield on glucose (Yx/s) and high specific biomass production rate (qx) in K strain in the presence of amino acids. In contrast, pre-formed precursor molecules such as amino acids did not affect fatty acid biosynthesis in E. coli B or Yx/s and qx, which were higher than those of E. coli K, suggesting that constitutive synthesis of energetically demanding precursors and higher fatty acid β-oxidation activity is key for high biomass-performer E. coli B.

     "abstract": "Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are microbial polyesters which accumulate as intracellular granules in numerous prokaryotes and mainly serve as storage materials; beyond this primary function, PHA also enhance the robustness of bacteria against various stress factors. We have observed that the presence of PHA in bacterial cells substantially enhances their ability to maintain cell integrity when suddenly exposed to osmotic imbalances. In the case of the non-halophilic bacterium Cupriavidus necator, the presence of PHA decreased plasmolysis-induced cytoplasmic membrane damage during osmotic up-shock, which subsequently enabled the cells to withstand subsequent osmotic downshock. In contrast, sudden induction of osmotic up- and subsequent down-shock resulted in massive hypotonic lysis of non-PHA containing cells as determined by Transmission Electron Microscopy and Thermogravimetrical Analysis. Furthermore, a protective effect of PHA against hypotonic lysis was also observed in the case of the halophilic bacterium Halomonas halophila; here, challenged PHA-rich cells were capable of retaining cell integrity more effectively than their PHA-poor counterparts. Hence, it appears that the fact that PHA granules, as an added value to their primary storage function, protect halophiles from the harmful effect of osmotic down-shock might explain why PHA accumulation is such a common feature among halophilic prokaryotes. The results of this study, apart from their fundamental importance, are also of practical biotechnological significance: because PHA-rich bacterial cells are resistant to osmotic imbalances, they could be utilized in in-situ bioremediation technologies or during enrichment of mixed microbial consortia in PHA producers under conditions of fluctuating salinity.",

However, in order to seek more efficient biomolecules, alternative biopolymers must be studied. Here, the applicability of a biopolymer produced by Rhizobium viscosum CECT 908 in Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery (MEOR) was evaluated. This biopolymer exhibited better rheological properties (including higher viscosity) when compared with xanthan gum. Its stability at high shear rates (up to 300 s−1), temperatures (up to 80 °C) and salinities (up to 200 g/L of NaCl) was also demonstrated. The biopolymer exhibited better performance than xanthan gum in oil recovery assays performed with a heavy crude oil, achieving 25.7 ± 0.5% of additional recovery.

In particular, there is a need to evaluate the possibility of implementing virus-inactivation treatment during HPL production to ensure optimal safety of industrial HPL pools. Expired human platelet concentrates from four different donors were pooled and subjected to freeze-thaw cycles (-80/+37 °C), followed or not by serum-conversion by calcium chloride, heat-treatment at 56 °C for 30 min, or solvent-detergent (S/D) virus inactivation.

The impact of HPL supplementation on the cell morphology, doubling time, immunophenotype and trilineage differentiation capacity of Wharton jelly MSCs (WJMSCs) were compared over five passages, using FBS as a control and normalizing the protein content. Data showed that WJMSCs expanded equally well, exhibited a typical fibroblast morphology, had short doubling times, maintained their immunophenotypes, and differentiated into chondrocyte, osteocyte, and adipocyte lineages in all HPL-supplemented media, all of which were more effective than FBS.

Furthermore, a real fermentation broth (RFB) obtained from the fermentative production of lactic acid from food waste was tested. Using 4.8 g SP, more than 95% of phosphate, present at an initial concentration of 50 mg L−1, could be removed from PPS and PPS containing alcohols after 120 min. The presence of organic acids reduced the removal capacity of SP and only 55%–73% of the phosphate initially present was removed. The presence of lactic acid also substantially affected the removal of phosphate from RFB when 132 mg L−1 phosphate was initially present: after 120 min, only 28.6 mg L−1 of phosphate had been removed.

Moreover, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is demanding increasingly rigorous administration from all those organisations processing personal data. The BBMRI-LPC project (Biobanking and Biomolecular Research Infrastructure ― Large Prospective Cohorts) assembled 21 LPCs from 10 countries and two EU-wide multinational cohort networks with a key objective to promote collaborative innovative transnational research proposed by external researchers on the broad field of common chronic diseases, and analyze the gaps and needs involved. BBMRI-LPC organized three scientific calls to offer European investigators an opportunity to gain free of charge transnational access to research material available in the participating cohorts. A total of 11 high-quality research proposals involving multiple prospective cohorts were granted, and the access process in the individual projects carefully monitored. Divergent access governance structures, complex legal and ethical frameworks and heterogeneous procedures were identified as currently constituting substantial obstacles for sample and data transfer in Europe.

The U.S. bioeconomy emerged in the early 2000s as a result of the societal pursuit of energy independence and security, greenhouse gas emission mitigation and sustainable development. Founded on biotechnologies and stimulated by federal policies, the U.S. bioeconomy has been growing rapidly over the past decade. Intensive research and development endeavors have been carried out to explore advanced technologies for efficient biomass production, conversion, and valorization, through which numerous biotechnological innovations have been achieved to realize the commercial, cost-effective production of diverse transportation biofuels and high-value domestic bioproducts from various biomass feedstocks. The bioenergy products currently commercialized in the U.S. include bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, bioheat and biopower; the commercialized bioproducts extend to biopolymers, biochemicals, biopharmaceuticals and bioadhesives. In 2017, more than 65.4 billion liters of biofuels and 2500 certified bioproducts were produced, creating 4 million job opportunities and sharing 2.5% of the U.S. economy. Commercial production of cellulosic ethanol, renewable diesel, green jet fuel and other advanced biofuels remains at the demonstration stage and needs further improvement in cost-competitiveness. Envisioning a Billion-Ton-Bioeconomy by 2030, the U.S. federal government has been implementing strategic activities to realize the goal.

     "abstract": "In emerging bioeconomies, the compostable biopolymers polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are desirable products due to their similarity to petropolymers. While industrial PHA production has been growing rapidly, obtaining a cheap and sustainable carbon source is still a challenge. Among biobased feedstocks, lignocellulose is a cheap, abundant and potentially sustainable carbon source. However, because of its recalcitrance, separation and depolymerization processes that have not reached industrial maturity are usually required. Integrated biorefineries utilize a holistic approach to conversion processes to minimize feedstock price and maximize resource use. This review examines the technical feasibility of merging PHA production and lignocellulose biorefining in integrated processing facilities. Among lignocellulosic feedstocks, wood is a promising carbon source due to its mature industrial infrastructure. Among the lignocellulose components, the hemicellulose fraction is the most promising feedstock for PHA production since it is underutilized and can be combined with bioethanol production from the cellulose fraction. Fractionation processes allow separate recovery of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, to which PHA can be added as a co-product.",

One of the first observed and prominent responses to JAs is the induction of biosynthesis of different groups of secondary compounds. Among them are nicotine, isoquinolines, glucosinolates, anthocyanins, benzophenanthridine alkaloids, artemisinin, and terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs), such as vinblastine. This brief review describes modes of action of JAs in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins, nicotine, TIAs, glucosinolates and artemisinin. After introducing JA biosynthesis, the central role of the SCFCOI1-JAZ co-receptor complex in JA perception and MYB-type and MYC-type transcription factors is described. Brief comments are provided on primary metabolites as precursors of secondary compounds. Pathways for the biosynthesis of anthocyanin, nicotine, TIAs, glucosinolates and artemisinin are described with an emphasis on JA-dependent transcription factors, which activate or repress the expression of essential genes encoding enzymes in the biosynthesis of these secondary compounds. Applied aspects are discussed using the biotechnological formation of artemisinin as an example of JA-induced biosynthesis of secondary compounds in plant cell factories.",

     "abstract": "Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a staple food for a significant part of the world’s population. The growing demand on its production can be satisfied by improving yield and resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. Knowledge of the genome sequence would aid in discovering genes and QTLs underlying these traits and provide a basis for genomics-assisted breeding. Physical maps and BAC clones associated with them have been valuable resources from which to generate a reference genome of bread wheat and to assist map-based gene cloning. As a part of a joint effort coordinated by the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium, we have constructed a BAC-based physical map of bread wheat chromosome arm 7DS consisting of 895 contigs and covering 94% of its estimated length. By anchoring BAC contigs to one radiation hybrid map and three high resolution genetic maps, we assigned 73% of the assembly to a distinct genomic position. This map integration, interconnecting a total of 1713 markers with ordered and sequenced BAC clones from a minimal tiling path, provides a tool to speed up gene cloning in wheat. The process of physical map assembly included the integration of the 7DS physical map with a whole-genome physical map of Aegilops tauschii and a 7DS Bionano genome map, which together enabled efficient scaffolding of physical-map contigs, even in the non-recombining region of the genetic centromere. Moreover, this approach facilitated a comparison of bread wheat and its ancestor at BAC-contig level and revealed a reconstructed region in the 7DS pericentromere.",

     "abstract": "Silene latifolia serves as a model species to study dioecy, the evolution of sex chromosomes, dosage compensation and sex-determination systems in plants. Currently, no protocol for genetic transformation is available for this species, mainly because S. latifolia is considered recalcitrant to in vitro regeneration and infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Using cytokinins and their synthetic derivatives, we markedly improved the efficiency of regeneration. Several agrobacterial strains were tested for their ability to deliver DNA into S. latifolia tissues leading to transient and stable expression of the GUS reporter. The use of Agrobacterium rhizogenes strains resulted in the highest transformation efficiency (up to 4.7% of stable transformants) in hairy root cultures. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses of the T1 generation suggested that the majority of transformation events contain a small number of independent T-DNA insertions and the transgenes are transmitted to the progeny in a Mendelian pattern of inheritance. In short, we report an efficient and reproducible protocol for leaf disc transformation and subsequent plant regeneration in S. latifolia, based on the unique combination of infection with A. rhizogenes and plant regeneration from hairy root cultures using synthetic cytokinins. A protocol for the transient transformation of S.latifolia protoplasts was also developed and applied to demonstrate the possibility of targeted mutagenesis of the sex linked gene SlAP3 by TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9.",

     "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) as a carcinogen poses a great threat to food security and public health through plant-derived foods such as rice, the staple for nearly half of the world’s population. We have previously reported that overexpression of truncated gene fragments derived from the rice genes OsO3L2 and OsO3L3 could reduce Cd accumulation in transgenic rice. However, we did not test the full length genes due to prior work in Arabidopsis where overexpression of these genes caused seedling lethality. Here, we report on limiting the overexpression of OsO3L2 and OsO3L3 through the use of the stress- inducible promoter RD29B. However, despite generating 625 putative transformants, only 7 lines survived as T1 seedlings and only 1 line of each overexpressed OsO3L2 or OsO3L3-produced T2 progeny. The T2 homozygotes from these 2 lines showed the same effect of reducing accumulation of Cd in root and shoot as well as in T3 grain. As importantly, the concentrations of essential metals copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) were unaffected. Analysis of the expression profile suggested that low Cd accumulation may be due to high expression of OsO3L2 and OsO3L3 in the root tip region. Cellular localization of OsO3L2 and OsO3L3 indicate that they are histone H2A interacting nuclear proteins in vascular cells and especially in the root tip region. It is possible that interaction with histone H2A modifies chromatin to regulate downstream gene expression.",

Four embryogenic cell lines of Norway spruce were grown on media enriched with copper and arsenic in concentration ranges 50–500 μM and 10–50 μM, respectively. The effects were observed during subsequent stages of somatic embryogenesis, the characteristics evaluated being proliferation potential, average number of somatic embryos obtained per g/fresh weight, morphology of developed somatic embryos, metal uptake, and microanalysis of macro- and micronutrients uptake. Copper and arsenic at higher concentrations significantly reduced the growth of early somatic embryos. In almost all treatments, the cell line V-1-3 showed the best performance compared with the other lines tested. Environmental scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize and identify morphological abnormalities in the development of somatic embryos. Abnormalities observed were classified into several categories: meristemless somatic embryos, somatic embryos with disrupted meristem, reduced number of cotyledons, single cotyledon and fused cotyledons. With the application of a low temperature method for the environmental scanning electron microscope, samples were stabilized and whole meristems could be investigated in their native state. As far as we are aware, this is the first report of the effect of copper and arsenic during the process of somatic embryogenesis and the first to evaluate the content of macro and micronutrients uptake in Norway spruce.",

Despite numerous studies devoted to understanding its role in a wide spectrum of physiological processes, full appreciation of its function is linked to a comprehensive determination of its spatio-temporal distribution, which plays a crucial role in its mode of action. Conjugation of fluorescent tracers to plant hormones enables sensitive and specific visualization of their subcellular and tissue-specific localization and transport in planta, which represents a powerful tool for plant physiology. However, to date, only a few fluorescently labeled auxins have been developed. We report the synthesis of four novel fluorescently labeled derivatives of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in the form of a conjugate with a nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) fluorophore together with validation of their biological activity. These compounds, unlike other previously reported auxins fluorescently labeled at N1 position (nitrogen of the indole ring), do not possess auxin activity but rather show dose-dependent inhibition of auxin-induced effects, such as primary root growth inhibition, root hair growth and the auxin reporter DR5::GUS expression. Moreover, the study demonstrates the importance of the character of the linker and optimal choice of the labeling site in the preparation of fluorescently labeled auxins as important variables influencing their biological activity and fluorescent properties.",

Exogenous application of GABA has also conferred higher stress tolerance by modulating the expression of genes involved in plant signalling, transcriptional regulation, hormone biosynthesis, reactive oxygen species production and polyamine metabolism. Plant hormones play critical roles in adaptation of plants to adverse environmental conditions through a sophisticated crosstalk among them. Several studies have provided evidence for the relationships between GABA, polyamines and hormones such as abscisic acid, cytokinins, auxins, gibberellins and ethylene, among others, focussing on the effect that one specific group of compounds exerts over the metabolic and signalling pathways of others. In this review, we bring together information obtained from plants exposed to several stress conditions and discuss the possible links among these different groups of molecules. The analysis supports the view that highly conserved pathways connect primary and secondary metabolism, with an overlap of regulatory functions related to stress responses and tolerance among phytohormones, amino acids and polyamines.",

The compounds investigated are related to both the catabolic and anabolic pathways of l-phenylalanine and l-tyrosine, the main molecules in the biosynthesis of polyphenols. The concentrations of the simple phenolic acids responded significantly to NiCl2, CdCl2 and CuCl2 at 5, 20 and 40 μM concentrations. The 3PPP phenolic acid concentrations after 24 h were always higher in metal-treated cells than in controls, while the 2DR concentrations were significantly lower in the metal-treated cells than the controls. The GSH/GSSG ratio was lower in all experimental groups treated with the selected metals (especially so at 40 μM). Pearson correlation analysis indicated a strong negative correlation between ascorbate and rosmarinic acid content (−0.670; p < 0.05) in NiCl2-treated samples and reduced glutathione and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic content (−0.700; p < 0.05) in CdCl2-treated samples.

Here new hybrid type SL mimics have been designed derived from auxins, the common plant growth regulators. Auxins were simply coupled with the butenolide D-ring using bromo (or chloro) butenolide. D-rings having an extra methyl group at the vicinal C-3′ carbon atom, or at the C-2′ carbon atom, or at both have also been studied. The new hybrid type SL mimics were bioassayed for germination activity of seeds of the parasitic weeds S. hermonthica, O. minor and P. ramosa using the classical method of counting germinated seeds and a colorimetric method. For comparison SL mimics derived from phenyl acetic acid were also investigated. The bioassays revealed that mimics with a normal D-ring had appreciable to good activity, those with an extra methyl group at C-2′ were also appreciably active, whereas those with a methyl group in the vicinal C-3′ position were inactive (S. hermonthica) or only slightly active.

Morphological characterisation of the 3D printed moulds was performed and reactors were fabricated with an approximately square-shaped cross-section of 1 mm2. Notably, they were tested for operation over a wide range of volumetric flow rates, up to 20 ml/min. Moreover, the fabrication time (i.e., from design to the finished product) was <1 day, at an average material cost of ∼£5. The flow reactors have been applied to the production of both inorganic nanoparticles (silver nanospheres) and organic vesicular systems (liposomes), and their performance compared with reactors produced using more laborious fabrication methods. Numerical simulations were performed to characterise the transport of fluids and chemical species within the devices. The developed fabrication method is suitable for scaled-up fabrication of continuous-flow reactors, with potential for application in biotechnology and nanomedicine.",

     "abstract": "The limited availability of metabolite-specific sensors for continuous sampling and monitoring is one of the main bottlenecks contributing to failures in bioprocess development. Furthermore, only a limited number of approaches exist to connect currently available measurement systems with high throughput reactor units. This is especially relevant in the biocatalyst screening and characterization stage of process development.In this work, a strategy for sensor integration in microfluidic platforms is demonstrated, to address the need for rapid, cost-effective and high-throughput screening in bioprocesses. This platform is compatible with different sensor formats by enabling their replacement and was built in order to be highly flexible and thus suitable for a wide range of applications. Moreover, this re-usable platform can easily be connected to analytical equipment, such as HPLC, laboratory scale reactors or other microfluidic chips through the use of standardized fittings. In addition, the developed platform includes a two-sensor system interspersed with a mixing channel, which allows the detection of samples that might be outside the first sensor’s range of detection, through dilution of the sample solution up to 10 times.In order to highlight the features of the proposed platform, inline monitoring of glucose levels is presented and discussed. Glucose was chosen due to its importance in biotechnology as a relevant substrate. The platform demonstrated continuous measurement of substrate solutions for up to 12 h. Furthermore, the influence of the fluid velocity on substrate diffusion was observed, indicating the need for in-flow calibration to achieve a good quantitative output.",

The implementation of biocatalysts in industrial processes relies strongly on fast and cost effective process development, including selection of a biocatalyst form and the strategy for its immobilization. Here, microscale reactors with selected surface-immobilized amine-transaminase (ATA) in various forms are described as platforms for high-throughput process development. Wild type ATA (ATA-wt) from a crude cell extract, as well as Escherichia coli cells intracellularly overexpressing the enzyme, were immobilized on the surfaces of meander microchannels of disposable plastics by means of reactor surface silanization and glutaraldehyde bonding. In addition, a silicon/glass microchannel reactor was used for immobilization of an ATA-wt, genetically engineered to contain a silica-binding module (SBM) at the N-terminus (N-SBM-ATA-wt), leading to immobilization on the non-modified inner microchannel surface. Microreactors with surface-immobilized biocatalysts were coupled with a quenching system and at-line HPLC analytics and evaluated based on continuous biotransformation, yielding acetophenone and l-alanine. E. coli cells and N-SBM-ATA-wt were efficiently immobilized and yielded a volumetric productivity of up to 14.42 g L−1 h−1, while ATA-wt small load resulted in two orders of magnitude lower productivity. The miniaturized reactors further enabled in-operando characterization of biocatalyst stability, crucial for successful transfer to a production scale.",

     "abstract": "Protein immobilization is a key enabling technology for flow biocatalysis. For this purpose, many different immobilization protocols and characterization techniques have been developed in recent decades. However, examples where proteins are directly immobilized on ready-to-use reactors are scarce, likely due to the lack of analytical tools to monitor in-flow protein immobilization in a non-invasive manner. Here, we have for the first time exploited Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to characterize in-flow protein immobilization on pre-packed bed columns. This concept was demonstrated by in-flow immobilization of a green fluorescence protein. MRI analysis revealed that both the protein concentration of the flushed solution and flow rate play key roles in controlling the spatial organization of the protein across the packed-bed reactor. This analytical tool coupled to in-flow protein immobilization has been expanded to more industrially relevant enzymes, such as the lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus, achieving a ready-to-use reactor packed with a heterogeneous biocatalyst with high activity (up to 3000 U × g−1) and high stability (75% residual activity after 1 h incubation at 60 °C). Introducing new analytical tools during the fabrication of heterogeneous biocatalysts will contribute to make the process of immobilizing proteins on solid carriers more rational than currently is.",

     "abstract": "Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) microfluidic devices have become promising platforms for a wide range of applications. Here we report a simple method for immobilising histidine-tagged enzymes suitable for PMMA microfluidic devices. The 1-step-immobilisation described is based on the affinity of the His-tag/Ni-NTA interaction and does not require prior amination of the PMMA surface, unlike many existing protocols. We compared it with a 3-step immobilisation protocol involving amination of PMMA and linking NTA via a glutaraldehyde cross-linker. These methods were applied to immobilise transketolase (TK) in PMMA microfluidic devices. Binding efficiency studies showed that about 15% of the supplied TK was bound using the 1-step method and about 26% of the enzyme was bound by the 3-step method. However, the TK-catalysed reaction producing l-erythrulose performed in microfluidic devices showed that specific activity of TK in the device utilising the 1-step immobilisation method was approximately 30% higher than that of its counterpart. Reusability of the microfluidic device produced via the 1-step method was tested for three cycles of enzymatic reaction and at least 85% of the initial productivity was maintained. The device could be operated for up to 40 h in a continuous flow and on average 70% of the initial productivity was maintained. The simplified immobilisation method required fewer chemicals and less time for preparation of the immobilised microfluidic device compared to the 3-step method while achieving higher specific enzyme activity. The method represents a promising approach for the development of immobilised enzymatic microfluidic devices and could potentially be applied to combine protein purification with immobilisation.",

Modular microfluidics allows the integration of these newly developed approaches in a more flexible way towards increasing applicability of the microfluidic chips to different types of biocatalysts and reactions. A highly relevant operation in such a system is biocatalyst inactivation, which can enable the precise control of reaction time by avoiding the continuation of the reaction in another module or connecting tubes. Such control is important when different modules of reactors and/or sensing units are used and changed frequently. Here we describe the development, characterization and application of a module for rapid enzyme inactivation. The thermal inactivation platform developed is compared with a standard benchtop ThermoMixer in terms of inactivation efficiency for glucose oxidase and catalase. A higher activity loss was observed for enzyme inactivation under flow conditions (inactivation achieved at 120 s residence time at 338 K and 20 s residence time at 353 K) which indicated a high heat transfer to the fluid under dynamic conditions. Moreover, partial deactivation of the enzymes was observed for the continuous thermal inactivation module, when activity measurements were performed after 1 and 2 days following inactivation. The thermal inactivation unit presented can be easily integrated into modular microfluidic platforms and can be a useful addition for enzyme characterization and screening.",

     "abstract": "Microfluidics has enabled various research projects in the field of microbial single-cell analysis. In particular, single-use microfluidic cultivation devices combined with automated time-lapse imaging provide powerful approaches for analyzing microbial phenomena at the single-cell level. High spatiotemporal resolution facilitates individual cell identification and tracking, delivering detailed insights into areas like phenotypic population heterogeneity, which can be highly relevant to the fate of a microbial population and may negatively impact the efficiency of biotechnological fermentations. New tools need to be developed to access the origin of population heterogeneity and understand its functional role. In this study, we present a microfluidic device for batch cultivations inside picoliter-sized cultivation chambers that can be reversibly isolated from continuous medium supply. Therefore, the cultivation broth is simply replaced by a continuous flow of humidified air, removing any medium residue along the supply channels but preserving five picoliters of cultivation medium inside the cultivation chambers in a highly parallel manner. Living cells can grow inside our microfabricated batch chambers, which can accommodate up to several hundred cells. The chamber height approximately matches the diameter of a single cell, facilitating cell growth in monolayers that are ideal for image-based cell analysis. We successfully demonstrated the growth of Escherichia coli during continuous medium perfusion and batch cultivation conditions. As expected, the cells grew exponentially under continuous medium influx until the maximum chamber capacity was reached, but when they were cultivated under batch conditions, cellular growth underwent an exponential phase, followed by a stationary phase with obvious morphological changes.",

The results add to prior reports, where gradients of non-electrolytes and monovalent salts, produced by micropipette injection, did not induce a noticeable migration of vesicles. The migration distances measured depended on the solution and the cell or vesicle type, and were in the range of several tens of micrometers.

The key point of this study was to find an ATPS exhibiting a large difference in the partition coefficients of the biocatalyst and reaction products. Several ATPSs based on polyethylene glycol (PEG)/phosphate, PEG/citrate, and PEG/dextran were tested. We found that an ATPS consisting of 15 wt% of PEG 4000, 10 wt% of phosphates, 75 wt% of water (pH value 8.0 after dissolution) provided optimal separation of 6-APA from the enzyme. While the 6-APA was mainly found in the top PEG phase, the free enzyme favored the bottom salt-rich phase. This ATPS also fulfils other important requirements: (i) high buffering capacity, reducing an undesirable pH decrease due to the dissociation of phenylacetic acid (the side product of the reaction), (ii) a relatively low cost of the ATPS components, (iii) the possibility of electrophoretic transport of fine droplets as well as the reaction products for both the acceleration of phase separation and the enhancement of 6-APA concentration in the product stream. Extraction experiments in microcapillary and batch systems showed that the transport of 6-APA formed in the salt-rich phase to the corresponding PEG phase could occur within 30 s. The experimental results described form a base of knowledge for the development of continuously operating integrated microfluidic reactors-separators driven by an electric field for the efficient production of 6-APA.",

In this investigation, biodiesel production was catalysed by lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus (Lipolase L100). Edible sunflower oil was used as a model substrate in order to investigate the process. After optimal process conditions had been determined, waste-cooking oil was used for biodiesel production to make the production process more sustainable. Three different substrate-feeding strategies were investigated and finally an optimal strategy was proposed. In all the investigated systems, fatty acids methyl esters (FAME) content was higher than 95% and obtained in a significantly shorter time (less than 2 h) compared to the batch process in which biodiesel production was catalysed by lipase (C = 95%, t = 96 h).

GHGs (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) emitted at the outlet of three different cleaning systems (“chemical scrubber”, “bioscrubber” and “bioscrubber + denitrification step”) were assessed and compared with the emissions generated by the exhaust air with “no treatment”. The calculations show that the chemical scrubber has no effect whereas biological treatments can increase GHG emissions. The use of bioscrubbers alone for NH3 removal can remain acceptable provided that less than 3% of the NH3 entering the apparatus is converted into N2O. In such cases, a maximum increase of 1.9% in GHG emissions could be obtained. Conversely, the addition of a denitrification step to a bioscrubber must be avoided. Increases in overall GHG emissions of up to 25.8% were calculated but more significant increases could occur. With regard to GHG emissions, it is concluded that the use of a chemical scrubber is more suitable than a bioscrubber to treat exhaust air from pig farms.",

Here, B. megaterium spores have been used to adsorb Bcp1 (bacterioferritin comigratory protein 1), a peroxiredoxin of the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, known to have an antioxidant activity. The spores were highly efficient in adsorbing the heterologous enzyme which, once adsorbed, retained its activity. The adsorbed Bcp1 localized beneath the exosporium, filling the space between the outer coat and the exosporium.

The problem of defining precise standards for antibody validation has engendered much debate in recent publications and meetings, but gradually a consensus is emerging. At the 8th Alpbach Affinity Proteomics workshop (March 2017), a panel of leaders in the antibody field discussed suggestions which could bring this complex but essential issue a step nearer to a resolution. ‘Alpbach recommendations’ for best practice include tailoring binder validation processes according to the intended applications and promoting greater transparency in publications and in the information available from commercial antibody developers/providers.

Through phage display, we have isolated 10 engineered Forkhead-associated (FHA) domains that selectively bind to a phosphothreonine (pThr)-containing peptide (53-FELLPpTPPLSPS-64) segment of human c-Myc. One domain variant was observed to bind to the Myc-pThr58 peptide with a KD value of 800 nM and had >1000-fold discrimination between the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptide.

The Myc-pTBD was observed to be structurally similar to the yeast Rad9 FHA1 domain, except that its β4-β5 and β10-β11 loops form a hydrophobic pocket to facilitate the interaction between the domain and the peptide ligand.

Its activation is dependent on the sequential phosphorylation of residue threonine 71 (T71) followed by threonine 69 (T69) in its transactivation domain. While these modifications can be directed by a variety of kinases, the time to reach full phosphorylation is dependent on which signaling pathway has been activated, which is thought to be important for proper temporal regulation. To explore this phenomenon further, there have been ongoing efforts to generate affinity reagents for monitoring phosphorylation events in cellular assays. While phospho-specific antibodies have been valuable tools for monitoring cell signaling events, those raised against a peptide containing two or more adjacent phosphosites tend to cross-react with that peptide’s various phospho-states, rendering such reagents unusable for studying sequential phosphorylation. As an alternative, we have employed the N-terminal Forkhead-associated 1 (FHA1) domain of yeast Rad53p as a scaffold to generate recombinant affinity reagents via phage display and were successful in generating a set of reagents that can distinguish between the dual-phosphorylated epitope, 63-IVADQpTPpTPTRFLK-77, and the mono-phosphorylated epitope, 63-IVADQpTPTPTRFLK-77, in the human ATF2 transactivation domain.",

When designed as radiolabeled monomeric probes for imaging and therapy of cancer, their fast and specific targeting results in high tumor-to-background ratios early after injection. However, their moderate absolute uptake into tumors might not always be sufficient to treat cancerous lesions. We have evaluated the pharmacokinetics of seven constructs derived from a CD20-targeting monomeric sdAb (αCD20). The constructs differed in affinity or avidity towards CD20 (dimeric αCD20-αCD20 and αCD20 fused to a non-targeting control sdAb, referred to as αCD20-ctrl) and blood half-lives (αCD20 fused to an albumin-targeting sdAb (αAlb) = αCD20-αAlb). The constructs were radiolabeled with 111In (imaging) and 177Lu (therapy) using the bifunctional chelator CHX-A”-DTPA and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In mice, tumor uptake of 177Lu-DTPA-αCD20 decreased from 4.82 ± 1.80 to 0.13 ± 0.05% IA/g over 72 h. Due to its rapid blood clearance, tumor-to-blood (T/B) ratios of >100 were obtained within 24 h. Although in vitro internalization indicated that dimeric 177Lu-DTPA-αCD20-αCD20 was superior in terms of total cell-associated radioactivity, this was not confirmed in vivo. Blood clearance was slower and absolute tumor uptake became significantly higher for αCD20-αAlb. Blood levels of 177Lu-DTPA-αCD20-αAlb decreased from 68.30 ± 10.53 to 3.58 ± 0.66% IA/g over 120 h, while tumor uptake increased from 6.21 ± 0.94 to 24.90 ± 2.83% IA/g, resulting in lower T/B ratios. Taken together, these results indicate that the increased size of dimeric αCD20-αCD20 or the fusion of monomeric αCD20 to an albumin-targeting moiety (αAlb) counterbalance their improved tumor targeting capacity compared to monomeric αCD20.",

The ranking and performance of the scFv isolated by flow sorting in surface-immobilised form was retained when expressed as soluble scFv and analysed by biolayer interferometry, as well as after expression as full-length antibodies in mammalian cells.

The epitopes recognized by the novel antibodies were mapped to peptides located in the first or second extracellular domains of zCdh2. These antibodies allowed improved observations of the spatial distribution of zCdh2 from imaging of whole mount zebrafish preparations. Since the generated antibodies are sequence defined, they can always be reconstituted from the information stored in the respective computer file, securing future reproducibility of respective experiments.

     "abstract": "The hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural protein 3 (NS3) is essential for HCV maturation. The NS3/4A protease is a target for several HCV treatments and is a well-known target for HCV drug discovery. The protein is membrane associated and thus probably interacts with other membrane proteins. However, the vast majority of known NS3 host partners are soluble proteins rather than membrane proteins, most likely due to lack of appropriate platforms for their discovery. Utilization of an integrated microfluidics platform enables analysis of membrane proteins in their native form. We screened over 2800 membrane proteins for interaction with NS3 and 90 previously unknown interactions were identified. Of these, several proteins were selected for validation by co-immunoprecipitation and for NS3 proteolytic activity. Bearing in mind the considerable number of interactions formed, together with the popularity of NS3/4A protease as a drug target, it was striking to note its lack of proteolytic activity. Only a single protein, Neuregulin1, was observed to be cleaved, adding to the 3 known NS3/4A cleavage targets. Neuregulin1 participates in neural proliferation. Recent studies have shown its involvement in HCV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma. We showed that NS3/4A triggers an increase in neuregulin1 mRNA levels in HCV infected cells. Despite this increase, its protein concentration is decreased due to proteolytic cleavage. Additionally, its EGF-like domain levels were increased, possibly explaining the ErbB2 and EGFR upregulation in HCV infected cells. The newly discovered protein interactions may provide insights into HCV infection mechanisms and potentially provide new therapeutic targets against HCV.",

     "abstract": "Potential biotechnological recycling processes for rubber products include the bacterial degradation of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) (IR) in order to achieve its total biodegradation or its biotransformation into useful products. The actinomycete Gordonia polyisoprenivorans strain VH2 catalyzes the degradation of IR and enables its use as a sole carbon source via β-oxidation. The initial cleavage reaction is catalyzed by the extracellular latex clearing protein (Lcp). This dioxygenase is the key enzyme for the formation of oligo(cis-1,4-isoprene) molecules with different lengths, i.e., numbers of isoprene units. For the first time, IR was used as a solid substrate in 2-l fermenters. Two different particle size fractions (63–500 and 500–1000 μm) and three stirring rates (300, 400 and 500 rpm) were evaluated in the process. An increase of the cell concentration was achieved by using smaller particles and by using lower stirring rates, reaching a final biomass concentration of 0.52 g l−1 at 300 rpm after 12 days of cultivation. In order to enhance the formation of oligo(cis-1,4-isoprene) molecules, a transposon insertion mutant (TH5) of G. polyisoprenivorans strain VH2 that has lost the ability to transport the partial degradation products into the cells was used, thereby allowing the accumulation of the degradation products in the culture supernatants. Propionate, glucose and glycerol were evaluated as additional carbon sources besides IR, and the highest yields were observed on propionate. In 2-l bioreactors with pH control, different feeding regimes were performed during cultivation by the addition of propionate every 24 or 48 h for 16 days. After liquid-liquid extraction and a derivatization with Girard’s T reagent, the oligo(cis-1,4-isoprene) molecules were detected by ESI-MS. The mass distribution of the degradation products was affected by the selection of the extraction solvent, but no influence of longer cultivation periods was detected.",

Batch operation was used for growth, while continuous operation was employed during the fumaric acid production phase. A clear decrease in respiration, fumaric acid (FA) and ethanol production was observed when zero nitrogen was fed in the production phase, with FA productivity decreasing from an initial 0.7 g L−1 h−1 to 0.3 g L−1 h−1 after 150 h. With the addition of 0.625 mg L−1 h−1 of urea FA productivity dropped to only 0.4 g L−1 h−1 after 150 h and 0.3 g L−1 h−1 after 400 h. Under these conditions it was observed that the ethanol production rate decreased 20 times faster compared with the FA production rate, therefore resulting in high FA yields towards the end of the fermentation (instantaneous 0.96 g g−1 and average 0.81 g g−1 after 400 h). Increasing the urea feed rate to 1.875 mg L−1 h−1 resulted in a clear increase in FA production and respiration rates. This condition also resulted in a 25% increase in biomass after 150 h, while the decline in the ethanol production rate was seven times lower than in the 0.625 mg L−1 h−1 urea fermentation, resulting in lower FA yields.",

Substrate type and temperature were the primary factors influencing microbial community composition. Methanogenic activity ranged from 0.04 to 0.14 gCOD-CH4·g−1VS·day−1, and was significantly correlated with archaeal relative abundance and archaeal community PC2. The variability of NH3 resilience among inocula was moderate, with inhibition threshold values (KI50) ranging between 32 and 175 mgNH3-N·L−1. No microbial or operational factors correlated with NH3 resilience. However, the slopes of inhibition threshold curves were influenced by some environmental factors, namely substrate type, digester temperature and NH3 concentration. Overall, these results indicate that low and moderate background NH3 concentrations is not a key determinant of microbial community nor NH3 resilience.",

Transcriptome analyses of R. ruber TH revealed several representative promoters with different activity levels, e.g., Pami, Pcs, Pnh, P50sl36, PcbiM, PgroE and Pniami. β-Galactosidase (LacZ) reporter measurement demonstrated that different gene expression levels could be obtained with these natural promoters combined with an optimal RBS of ami. Further use of these promoters to overexpress the nitrile hydratase (NHase) gene with RBSami in R. ruber THdAdN produced different expression levels consistent with the transcription analyses. The −35 and −10 core elements of different promoters were further analyzed, and the conserved sequences were revealed to be TTGNNN and (T/C)GNNA(A/C)AAT. By mutating the core elements of the strong promoters, Pnh and Pami, into the above consensus sequence, two even stronger promoters, PnhM and PamiM, were obtained with 2.2-fold and 7.7-fold improvements in transcription, respectively. Integrating several strategies, including transcriptome promoter screening, −35 and −10 core element identification, core element point-mutation, RBS optimization and diverse reporter verification, a fine-tuning promoter-RBS combination mini-pool with different activity levels in Rhodococcus strains was successfully established.

The PN reactor operated with moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) technology, using plastic supports (carriers) for biofilm development. The microeukaryote community from the biofilm (BF) and the surrounding media (mixed liquor or ML) were analysed separately. Despite the physicochemical conditions under which the PN-MBBR operated (an average of 305.9 ± 117 mg TAN l−1 and 328.4 ± 131.9 mg N-NO2− l−1), up to 24 microeukaryotic taxa were observed by microscope. Microeukaryote species showed an uneven distribution in the PN-MBBR, thus suggesting the existence of two habitats: the BF, preferred by species with specific structures for adhering to a substrate, such as the stalked Peritrichia, and the ML, preferred by free-swimming or non-substrate dependent species. The results indicated that most ciliate population dynamics mainly responded to the nitrous acid and free ammonia concentrations and, to a lesser extent, to sCOD values. In the BF, variations in the population of Epistylis camprubii and Opercularia coarctata suggest the existence of competition between these species due to niche overlap. A V4 18S rDNA molecular survey (Illumina) was carried out for some samples with the aim of obtaining maximum coverage of the main eukaryote species that were microscopically detected throughout the study. The diversity and abundance data provided by both detection methods were compared.

Among these, a de-oiled soybean lecithin (SL-1), hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrins (HPB-CD) and sophorolipids (SR) achieved hydrocarbon removals close to those attained with the synthetic surfactant Triton™ X-100 (TX) in preliminary washing tests carried out at constant mixing rate, water/sand ratio and IFO-180 contamination level using agents concentrations close to their critical micelle concentration (0.1% and 1% w/v for microbial and non-microbial agents, respectively). The effects of agent concentration, water/sand ratio, mixing rate and IFO-180 contamination on hydrocarbons removal were modelled using face-centred central composite design and ANOVA. Optimal washing parameters for sand contamination levels in the range 0.5–20 g/kg were identified with response surface methodology. While HPB-CD and SR performed equally to TX only at low sand contaminations, SL-1 attained hydrocarbon removal higher or equal to that of TX at any IFO-180 contamination and at lower application rates. SL-1 also outperformed TX when minimizing the water/sand ratio, i.e., the volume of water used. Considering its lower toxicity, higher biodegradability and higher hydrocarbon removal efficiencies, SL-1 is an effective and environmentally sustainable alternative to synthetic surfactants in washing treatments for marine fuel-contaminated sands.",

Defluorination was obtained in the cultures fed with MFA, while DFA and TFA were recalcitrant in all tested conditions. When present in mixture, DFA was shown to inhibit biodegradation of MFA, while TFA had no effect. A total of 13 bacterial isolates obtained from MFA degrading cultures were found to degrade 20 mgL−1 of this compound, as single strains, when supplemented as a sole carbon source. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene indicated that among these degrading bacteria only Delftia acidovorans had been previously reported to be able to degrade MFA.

It is metabolized in human liver and excreted as ritalinic acid.

Five axenic strains were isolated and identified as: Arthrobacter sp. strain MW1, MW2 and MW3, Phycicoccus sp. strain MW4 and Nocardioides sp. strain MW5. Our research provides the first insight into the metabolism of ritalinic acid and suggests that it may differ depending on the strain and growth conditions, especially on availability of nitrogen. The isolates obtained in this study can serve as model organisms in further studies on the catabolism of ritalinic acid and methylphenidate but potentially also other compounds with similar structures.

A spent mushroom substrate from a local farm was tested for its applicability in various batch and trickle-bed reactors in degrading EDCs in model fortified and real communal wastewater. The reactors were tested under various regimes including a pilot-scale trickle-bed reactor, which was finally tested at a wastewater treatment plant. The result revealed that the spent substrate is an efficient biodegradation agent, where the fungus was usually able to remove about 95% of EDCs together with suppression of the estrogenic activity of the sample. The results showed the fungus was able to operate in the presence of bacterial microflora in wastewater without any substantial negative effects on the degradation abilities. Finally, a pilot-scale trickle-bed reactor was installed in a wastewater treatment plant and successfully operated for 10 days, where the bioreactor was able to remove more than 76% of EDCs present in the wastewater.",

In both cases, two different nutritional regimes were also evaluated, N-limitation and P-limitation. Results showed that the highest PHB concentration (104 mg L−1) was achieved under P limited conditions and permanent illumination, whereas the highest carbohydrate concentration (838 mg L−1) was obtained under N limited condition and light/dark alternation. With regard to bioplastics and biofuel generation, this study demonstrates that the accumulation of PHBs (bioplastics) and carbohydrates (potential biofuel substrate) is favored in wastewater-borne cyanobacteria under conditions where nutrients are limited.",

Recent advancements in synthetic biology have facilitated the development of recombinant spider silk proteins from Escherichia coli (E. coli). This study specifically investigates the economic feasibility and environmental impact of synthetic spider silk manufacturing. Pilot scale data was used to validate an engineering process model that includes all of the required sub-processing steps for synthetic fiber manufacture: production, harvesting, purification, drying, and spinning. Modeling was constructed modularly to support assessment of alternative downstream processing technologies. The techno-economic analysis indicates a minimum sale price from pioneer and optimized E. coli plants of $761 kg−1 and $23 kg−1 with greenhouse gas emissions of 572 kg CO2-eq. kg−1 and 55 kg CO2-eq. kg−1, respectively. Elevated costs and emissions from the pioneer plant can be directly tied to the high material consumption and low protein yield. Decreased production costs associated with the optimized plant includes improved protein yield, process optimization, and an Nth plant assumption. Discussion focuses on the commercial potential of spider silk, the production performance requirements for commercialization, and the impact of alternative technologies on the system.",

Greater insights into the system of rules that underpin regulatory frameworks for agri-food and biotechnology products in genetically modified (GM) crop- adopting nations will provide value by clarifying the evidence used to commercialize these technologies. This article examines the public documents available from Canada, the United States, the European Union and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development regarding the development of regulatory risk assessment frameworks for products of biotechnology to determine what science grounds these frameworks. The documentation used to provide the initial structure to the existing regulatory frameworks identifies the linkages, connections and relationships that exist between science, risk assessment and regulatory policy. The relationship between risk and regulation has never been more critical to the commercialization of innovative agricultural products. Documenting the role of science-based risk assessment in regulations and how this has changed over the 20 years of experience in regulating GM crops will identify changes in the risk/regulation relationship.",

     "abstract": "In 2008, the commercial cultivation of Genetically Modified (GM) cotton (Bollgard II®) started in Burkina Faso. The adoption rate increased rapidly in subsequent years to reach around 70% in 2014. Although some criticisms were raised concerning the suitability of the technology for the farming system in Burkina Faso, the introduction of transgenic cotton in the country was generally regarded as a great success. Despite this, during the 2016–2017 agricultural campaign, the government of Burkina Faso decided to suspend the cultivation of Bollgard II®. In this context, this paper investigates farmers’ knowledge, perceptions, opinions and attitudes towards Bollgard II® as well as their views on the recent decision to suspend its cultivation. Data was collected from 324 cotton farmers, both growers of conventional and Bollgard II®. The results showed that the farmers surveyed had a poor knowledge concerning the core concepts of biotechnology and Bollgard II® in particular. Moreover, the regulatory oversight of the implementation of the technology was found insufficient, as illustrated by the lack of compliance with prescriptions concerning refuge areas and pesticide treatments. Nevertheless, overall, the farmers interviewed had a slightly positive opinion about the effects on yield, income and their wellbeing. In particular the reduction in pesticide treatments was perceived very positively by all respondents. Although the study finds that the majority of farmers disagreed with the recent suspension of Bt cotton cultivation by the government, it also makes clear that a thorough debate on the technology and its implementation is necessary.",

Here, the requirements of the EU regulatory framework have been analysed for the entire chain from research to development and production of several potential applications including nanomaterials. The animal or biotechnological origin leads to specific requirements in production of the raw material. No EU legislation dedicated to nanomaterials has been adopted. Instead, products are governed under the respective existing product legislation subject to extra requirements for safety assessment. While a knowledge gap exists on hazards related to nanomaterials in general, there is a need to establish realistic regulatory study designs to assess the safety of specific products. Furthermore, as many of the existing chitosan applications are not considered nanomaterials, it would be discriminatory to treat biotechnology derived products differently.",

Currently, high-gradient magnetic separation as a direct capturing tool for protein purification suffers from the lack of suitable GMP-compliant separation equipment for industrial scale. As a solution for this bottleneck, we present a purification process for a monoclonal antibody directly from CHO cell culture by use of protein A-functionalized magnetic particles together with the first pilot-scale GMP-compliant ‘rotor-stator’ high-gradient magnetic separator. Five consecutive purification cycles were performed, achieving consistent yields of over 85% and purities of over 95%. Stable cell viabilities during the magnetic separation process enable integration of the device as an in situ product removal tool. A comparison with state-of-the-art protein A column-based purification processes reveals a 3-times higher process productivity per mL of applied resin and demonstrates the great potential of magnetic separation in downstream processing.",

     "abstract": "Increasing demand for natural fragrance ingredients and products has led to their global market growth. 2-Phenylethanol (2-PE) is a volatile substance widely used in food and cosmetics manufacturing. It is generally known that yeast can metabolize l-phenylalanine (l-Phe) to produce 2-PE. However, because the product exhibits an inhibitory effect on yeast cells, simple batch cultivation is uneconomic. The aim of this study was to enhance 2-PE productivity using in situ product removal. Here we present a new method of 2-PE production by yeast in a biphasic system with rapeseed oil as the second phase. The chosen solvent is safe, inexpensive and suitable for the extraction of 2-PE. In addition, rapeseed oil appeared to be a valuable source of intermediates for 2-PE synthesis as its presence in the yeast culture significantly enhanced productivity. The process is an environmentally friendly route and gives two final products that can be considered natural: rapeseed oil with a rose odor and pure 2-PE. Both may be subsequently used as food or cosmetics additives. The results obtained are competitive with previously reported values, as it was possible to enhance the overall concentration of 2-PE by 2.7-fold. The total 2-PE concentration in the biphasic system in the 4.5-L biofermentor used was increased to 9.79 g/L, while the 2-PE concentration in the organic phase attained a value of 18.50 g/L.",

     "abstract": "Stilbenes are naturally scarce high-added-value plant compounds with chemopreventive, pharmacological and cosmetic properties. Bioproduction strategies include engineering the metabolisms of bacterial, fungal and plant cell systems. Strikingly, one of the most effective strategies consists in the elicitation of wild grapevine cell cultures, which leads to vast stilbene resveratrol accumulation in the extracellular medium. The combination of both cell culture elicitation and metabolic engineering strategies to produce resveratrol analogs proved more efficient for the hydroxylated derivative piceatannol than for the dimethylated derivative pterostilbene, for which human hydroxylase HsCYP1B1- and grapevine O-methyltransferase VvROMT-transformed cell cultures were respectively used. Rose orcinol O-methyltransferase (OOMT) displays enzymatic properties, which makes it an appealing candidate to substitute VvROMT in the combined strategy to enhance the pterostilbene production level by engineered grapevine cells upon elicitation. Here we cloned a Rosa hybrida OOMT gene, and created a genetic construction suitable for Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation. OOMT’s ability to catalyze the conversion of resveratrol into pterostilbene was first assessed in vitro using protein extracts of agroinfiltrated N. benthamiana leaves and transformed grapevine callus. The grapevine cell cultures transformed with RhOOMT produced about 16 mg/L culture of pterostilbene and reached an extracellular distribution of up to 34% of total production at the best, which is by far the highest production reported to date in a plant system. A bonus large resveratrol production of ca. 1500–3000 mg/L was simultaneously obtained. Our results demonstrate a viable successful metabolic engineering strategy to produce pterostilbene, a resveratrol analog with enhanced pharmacological properties.",

We assessed the effects of the C9R tag on the biophysical and biochemical characteristics of TEV.

TEV-C9R was active over a pH range of 5–8, which was wider than that of the commonly used thrombin, and it remained active upon incubation at 60 °C much longer than the untagged-TEV, which aggregated at this temperature. Static and dynamic light scattering demonstrated the higher solubility of purified TEV-C9R. Furthermore, the thermal unfolding of TEV-C9R, as assessed by circular dichroism at pH 4.7, was almost perfectly reversible, in contrast to that of untagged-TEV, which aggregated at high temperature. These results demonstrate the improved biophysical and biochemical characteristics of TEV-C9R originating from higher solubility and provide another example of how SEP tags can enhance enzyme solubility without altering its activity.",

Microbe-based strategies for metal removal/recovery have received increasing interest thanks to the association of the microbial ability to detoxify toxic metal/metalloid polluted environments with the production of nanomaterials. This study investigates the tolerance and the bioconversion of selenite (SeO32−) by the aerobically grown Actinomycete Rhodococcus aetherivorans BCP1 in association with its ability to produce selenium nanoparticles and nanorods (SeNPs and SeNRs). The BCP1 strain showed high tolerance towards SeO32− with a Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of 500 mM. The bioconversion of SeO32− was evaluated considering two different physiological states of the BCP1 strain, i.e. unconditioned and/or conditioned cells, which correspond to cells exposed for the first time or after re-inoculation in fresh medium to either 0.5 or 2 mM of Na2SeO3, respectively. SeO32− bioconversion was higher for conditioned grown cells compared to the unconditioned ones. Selenium nanostructures appeared polydisperse and not aggregated, as detected by electron microscopy, being embedded in an organic coating likely responsible for their stability, as suggested by the physical-chemical characterization. The production of smaller and/or larger SeNPs was influenced by the initial concentration of provided precursor, which resulted in the growth of longer and/or shorter SeNRs, respectively. The strong ability to tolerate high SeO32− concentrations coupled with SeNP and SeNR biosynthesis highlights promising new applications of Rhodococcus aetherivorans BCP1 as cell factory to produce stable Se-nanostructures, whose suitability might be exploited for biotechnology purposes.",

FAEs as auxiliary enzymes significantly assist xylanolytic and pectinolytic enzymes in gaining access to their site of action during biomass saccharification for biofuel and biochemical production. A limited number of FAEs have been functionally characterized compared to over 1000 putative fungal FAEs that were recently predicted by similarity-based genome mining, which divided phylogenetically into different subfamilies (SFs). In this study, 27 putative and six characterized FAEs from both ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi were selected and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris and the recombinant proteins biochemically characterized to validate the previous genome mining and phylogenetical grouping and to expand the information on activity of fungal FAEs. As a result, 20 enzymes were shown to possess FAE activity, being active towards pNP-ferulate and/or methyl hydroxycinnamate substrates, and covering 11 subfamilies. Most of the new FAEs showed activities comparable to those of previously characterized fungal FAEs.",

Microbial consortium- and axenic culture-based experiments were conducted in a waste nutrient solution (WNS). A microbial consortium grown in the WNS and selected microalgae species of Paracercomonas saepenatans were inoculated in two different synthetic media (Bold’s Basal Medium (BBM) and synthetic WNS) in batch systems, and the microbial growth characteristics and the rate and extent of nutrient removal were determined for each system. No toxicity or growth inhibition was observed during microbial growth in either media. Both the waste-nutrient-grown microbial consortium and Paracercomonas saepenatans can be grown effectively in BBM and WNS, and both remove most ions from both media (e.g., >99% removal of NO3− and 41–100% removal of PO43−) within 16 days. Significant nutrient removal was observed during the growth phase of the microbial communities (4–10 days period), indicating major nutrient utilization for microbial growth as well as chemical mineral precipitation. Furthermore, MINEQL + 4.6 modeling showed higher PO43− removal in WNS during microbial growth (compared to BBM) due to precipitation of phosphate minerals (e.g., hydroxyapatite, vivianite). The dominant microbial species in both systems were also identified. DNA sequencing showed that Vorticella (58%) and Scenedesmus (33%) in WNS and Scenedesmus (89%) in BBM were the predominant species. This study demonstrates the potential application of microbial consortium (predominantly algae and protozoan)-based treatment techniques for hydroponic systems.",

     "abstract": "The recent trends in microalgal cultures are focused on the biorefinery of the biomass components. Some of them are not completely valorised, for example starch. Since there is a wide market for starch products in food and non-food industries, the exploitation of microalgal starch fractions could improve the economic sustainability of microalgae production. In this perspective, the optimization of nitrogen and carbon source uptake for starch accumulation is a critical point for reducing the nitrogen requirement footprint and to increase CO2 capture. In this study, four robust microalgal strains, already known as starch-accumulating strain, were investigated: Chlorella sorokiniana, Scenedesmus vacuolatus, Dunaliella tertiolecta, and Tetraselmis chuii. C. sorokiniana was selected as the best starch producer in the biorefinery context, and the role nitrogen and CO2 concentration had on the starch production was investigated. For light irradiance of 300 μmol m−2 s−1 the optimal nitrogen concentration for growth and starch accumulation resulted 32 mg L−1. The CO2 concentration clearly does not influence the starch accumulation, but concentrations distant from 2% negatively influence microalgal growth, affecting the final starch productivity. The biomass composition during the batch growth of C. sorokiniana was also analysed in order to explicitly characterise the dynamic of starch accumulation during the different growth phases. Protein content decreased during N-depletion, carbohydrates were mainly produced during the early N-depletion, followed by the accumulation of lipids in the late depletion.",

In the second reactor, half the acetate was dosed at the beginning of the cycle and the other half continuously. Having a true feast phase, the enrichment of P. acidivorans was not impeded by the continuous supply of acetate and the culture accumulated 85 wt.% PHA.

To test the integration of primary metabolism, particularly under climate change, we investigated which C and N metabolic traits and transcript levels are correlated in durum wheat flag leaves using a correlation network and a hierarchical cluster analysis. There was a high amount of positive correlation between traits involved in a wide range of biological processes, suggesting a close and intricate coordination between C-N metabolisms at the biochemical and transcriptional levels. Transcript levels for genes related to N uptake and assimilation were especially coexpressed with genes belonging to the respiratory pathway, highlighting the coordination between the synthesis of organic N compounds and provision of energy and C skeletons. Also involved in this coordination were Rubisco and nitrate reductase activities, which play a key role in the regulation of plant metabolism. Carbohydrate accumulation was linked with a down-regulation of photosynthetic and N metabolism genes and nitrate reductase activity. Based on the degree of connectivity between nodes, network exploration facilitated the identification of some traits that may be biologically relevant during plant abiotic stress tolerance, as most of them are involved in limiting steps of plant metabolism.",

The mixed microbial communities of a 3-stage PHA producing system fed initially with molasses and then cheese whey were investigated through amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The transition in feedstock resulted in an adaptation of the acidogenic community, where Actinobacteria dominated with sugarcane molasses (up to 93% of the operational taxonomic units) and Firmicutes, with cheese whey (up to 97%). The resulting fermentation products profile also changed, with a higher fraction of HV precursors obtained with molasses than cheese whey (7.1 ± 0.5 and 1.7 ± 0.7 gCOD/L, respectively). As for the PHA storing culture, the genera Azoarcus, Thauera and Paracoccus were enriched with fermented molasses (average 89% of Bacteria). Later, fermented cheese whey fostered a higher diversity, including some less characterised PHA-storers such as the genera Paenibacillus and Lysinibacillus. Although the microbial community structure was significantly affected by the feedstock shift, the acidogenic and PHA storing performance of the 3-stage system was very similar once a pseudo steady state was attained, showing that a reliable level of functional redundancy was attained in both mixed cultures.",

A recent transcriptomic analysis of the fungus Trichoderma harzianum, known for its increased β-glucosidase activity as compared to Trichoderma reesei, revealed two enzymes from family GH1 with high expression levels. Here we report the cloning, recombinant expression, purification and crystallization of these enzymes, ThBgl1 and ThBgl2. A close inspection of the enzymatic activity of these enzymes surprisingly revealed a marked difference between them despite the sequence similarity (53%). ThBgl1 has an increased tendency to catalyze transglycosylation reaction while ThBgl2 acts more as a hydrolyzing enzyme. Detailed comparison of their crystal structures and the analysis of the molecular dynamics simulations reveal the presence of an asparagine residue N186 in ThBgl2, which is replaced by the phenylalanine F180 in ThBgl1.

Heterotrophic growth was induced by the addition of olive mill wastewaters (9% v·v−1) to the culture. Variations in the calcium concentration affected differently biomass production depending on whether microalgae were cultivated under heterotrophic or photoautotrophic regime. In photoautotrophic regime, increasing the calcium concentration from 20 to 230 mg⋅L−1 decreased maximum cell concentration and growth rate. In heterotrophic cultivation, cell concentration and growth rate decreased with Ca2+ concentration increasing from 20 to 80 mg⋅L−1 but then increased with Ca2+ concentration increasing to 230 mg⋅L−1. Increasing calcium concentration invariably promoted cell aggregation. The precipitation of calcium phosphates can explain the decreasing growth rate and cell concentration attained with increasing calcium concentration, while the influence of Ca2+ concentration on the adsorption of phenols on suspended solids can explain the enhanced growth attained at large Ca2+ concentration under heterotrophic regime.

     "abstract": "Protein production using processed cell lysates is a core technology in synthetic biology and these systems are excellent to produce difficult toxins or membrane proteins. However, the composition of the central lysate of cell-free systems is still a “black box”. Escherichia coli lysates are most productive for cell-free expression, yielding several mgs of protein per ml of reaction. Their preparation implies proteome fractionation, resulting in strongly biased and yet unknown lysate compositions. Many metabolic pathways are expected to be truncated or completely removed. The lack of knowledge of basic cell-free lysate proteomes is a major bottleneck for directed lysate engineering approaches as well as for assay design using non-purified reaction mixtures.This study is starting to close this gap by providing a blueprint of the S30 lysate proteome derived from the commonly used E. coli strain A19. S30 lysates are frequently used for cell-free protein production and represent the basis of most commercial E. coli cell-free expression systems. A fraction of 821 proteins was identified as the core proteome in S30 lysates, representing approximately a quarter of the known E. coli proteome. Its classification into functional groups relevant for transcription/translation, folding, stability and metabolic processes will build the framework for tailored cell-free reactions.

     "abstract": "Research on the enzymatic breakdown of seaweed-derived agar has recently gained attention due to the progress in green technologies for marine biomass utilization. The enzymes known as agarases catalyze the cleavage of glycosidic bonds within the polysaccharide. In this study, a new β-agarase, Aga2, was identified from Cellulophaga omnivescoria W5C. Aga2 is one of four putative agarases from the W5C genome, and it belongs to the glycoside hydrolase 16 family. It was shown to be exclusive to the Cellulophaga genus. Agarase activity assays showed that Aga2 is an endolytic-type β-agarase that produces tetrameric and hexameric neoagaro-oligosaccharides, with optimum activity at 45 °C and pH 8.0. Zinc ions slightly enhanced its activity while manganese ions had inhibitory effects even at very low concentrations. Aga2 has a Km of 2.59 mg mL−1 and Vmax of 275.48 U mg−1. The Kcat is 1.73 × 102 s−1, while the Kcat/Km is 8.04 × 106 s−1 M−1. Aga2 also showed good thermostability at 45 °C and above, and retained >90% of its activity after repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Bioinformatic analysis of its amino acid sequence revealed that intrinsic properties of the protein (e.g. presence of certain dipeptides and the relative volume occupied by aliphatic amino acids) and tertiary structural elements (e.g. presence of salt bridges, hydrophobic interactions and H-bonding) contributed to its thermostability.",

     "abstract": "Among the structural polymers present in the plant cell wall, pectin is the main component of the middle lamella. This heterogeneous polysaccharide has an α-1,4 galacturonic acid backbone, which can be broken by the enzymatic action of pectinases, such as exo-polygalacturonases, that sequentially cleave pectin from the non-reducing ends, releasing mono or di-galacturonic acid residues. Constant demand for pectinases that better suit industrial requirements has motivated identification and characterization of novel enzymes from diverse sources. Bacillus licheniformis has been used as an important source for bioprospection of several industrial biomolecules, such as surfactants and enzymes, including pectate lyases. Here we cloned, expressed, purified, and biochemically and structurally characterized an exo-polygalacturonase from B. licheniformis (BlExoPG). Its low-resolution molecular envelope was derived from experimental small-angle scattering data (SAXS). Our experimental data revealed that BlExoPG is a monomeric enzyme with optimum pH at 6.5 and optimal temperature of approximately 60 °C, at which it has considerable stability over the broad pH range from 5 to 10. After incubation of the enzyme for 30 min at pH ranging from 5 to 10, no significant loss of the original enzyme activity was observed. Furthermore, the enzyme maintained residual activity of greater than 80% at 50 °C after 15 h of incubation. BlExoPG is more active against polygalacturonic acid as compared to methylated pectin, liberating mono galacturonic acid as a unique product. Its enzymatic parameters are Vmax = 4.18 μM.s−1, Km = 3.25 mgmL−1 and kcat = 2.58 s−1.",

GEs belong to a relatively new family of carbohydrate esterases (CE15) in the CAZy database (www.cazy.org), and so far around ten fungal GEs have been characterized. To explore additional GE enzymes, we used a genome mining strategy. BLAST analysis with characterized GEs against approximately 250 publicly accessible fungal genomes identified more than 150 putative fungal GEs, which were classified into eight phylogenetic sub-groups. To validate the genome mining strategy, 21 selected GEs from both ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi were heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris. Of these enzymes, 18 were active against benzyl d-glucuronate demonstrating the suitability of our genome mining strategy for enzyme discovery.",

     "abstract": "During the Industrial Revolution, it became clear that wood was unsuited as an energy source for industrial production, especially iron smelting. However, the transition to coal was the effort of decades. Similarly, the transition from coal to oil was neither a smooth nor rapid process. The transition to an energy and materials production regime based on renewable resources can similarly be expected to be fraught with many setbacks and obstacles, technically and politically. Those earlier transitions, however, were not complicated by the so-called grand challenges faced today. Above energy security and food and water security lurks climate change. Some events of 2015 have politically legitimised climate change and its mitigation, and 2016 saw the world finally sworn to action. The bioeconomy holds some of the answers to the economic challenges thrown up by mitigating climate change while maintaining growth and societal wellbeing. For bioeconomy policy makers, the future is complex and multi-faceted. The issues start in regions and extend to global reach. It is hard to quantify what is going to be the most difficult of challenges. However, one of the visions for the bioeconomy, that of distributed manufacturing in small- and medium-scale integrated biorefineries flies in the face of the current reality of massive fossil fuel and petrochemical economies of scale, married to gargantuan fossil fuel consumption subsidies.",

Particular attention is given to the biotechnology related programmes and more specifically to the “Cell Factory” Key Action in the 5th Framework Programme (1998–2002). This, together with the parallel development of a Strategy on Biotechnology in 2002, served as a solid foundation for the creation of the, at the time, so-called Knowledge-Based Bio-Economy (KBBE). The KBBE concept emerged in 2005, a couple of years before the launch of the 7th Framework Programme (2007–2013). The experience accumulated over the years and the new societal expectations triggered the EU to launch a Strategy on Bioeconomy in 2012. This article concludes with a brief analysis of the two most important impacts of the EU Strategy on Bioeconomy. One is the Bioeconomy dedicated activity within the Programme Horizon 2020 (2014–2020), and the other the creation of a public-private partnership of bio-based industries. Both the impact of Horizon 2020 on the EU Bioeconomy Strategy and the bio-based industries public-private partnership are analysed in depth in two articles elsewhere in this volume.",

The biogenic waste which is generated in enormous quanties in India can be considered as potential feedstock for structuring the bio-based economy. This communication depicts the need for developing waste derived bioeconomy in the Indian perspective. Waste is now being perceived as a resource with value and believed to supplement petroleum feedstock to a great extent if properly utilized. The necessity to introduce waste as the core element for the future economic models which also allows sustainable development is discussed. The review also establishes drivers for the bioeconomy and structures the waste derived bioeconomy in a sustainable format to address the futuristic needs, scope and opportunities envisaged in the business and economic realm.

In most cases, the approaches followed have been top-down policy-related initiatives, triggered by the public sector originating a dynamic which can bring together different bioeconomy stakeholders i.e. industry, academia, financial operators and farmers.This article describes a bottom-up situation with unique bioeconomy-related features that deserve specific attention. Over the last 40 years, Almería, in the south east of Spain, has developed one of the most efficient agro-industrial complexes in the world, evolving from a traditional and subsistence agriculture, to becoming the major vegetable exporter in the European Union (EU). This growth set aside issues such as sustainability, long-term perspectives on water resources or agricultural waste. However, societal concerns about a circular economy, as well as policy initiatives in the EU and in Spain on bioeconomy are changing the situation towards an integrated, efficient and sustainable bioeconomy system. Currently, the production chain demands innovations related to the use of biomass as source of bioproducts and bioenergy in order to remain competitive. Some positive aspects are the relatively small size of the agro-industrial area, making transport and communications rapid and easy, and the existence of strong and dedicated academic and financial institutions.

Not only does research and development in this sector aim at providing high yielding crops in order to maximize production, but R&D in this field will also allow to obtain highly specialized plant varieties with new or improved traits that fit to specific applications. At the same time, there is little awareness among the general public of the fact that state-of-the-art R&D is a prerequisite for the production of sufficient biomass of the right quality in a sustainable manner.

An interdisciplinary approach of various fields such as microbiology, molecular biology, chemistry, genetics, chemical engineering and agriculture in addition to cross-sectional technologies such as economy, logistics and digitalization is necessary to meet the future global challenges. The genomic era has contributed significantly to the exploitation of naturés biodiversity also from extreme habitats. By applying modern technologies it is now feasible to deliver robust enzymes (extremozymes) and robust microbial systems that are active at temperatures up to 120 °C, at pH 0 and 12 and at 1000 bar. In the post-genomic era, different sophisticated “omics” analyses will allow the identification of countless novel enzymes regardless of the lack of cultivability of most microorganisms. Furthermore, elaborate protein-engineering methods are clearing the way towards tailor-made robust biocatalysts. Applying environmentally friendly and efficient biological processes, terrestrial and marine biomass can be converted to high value products e.g. chemicals, building blocks, biomaterials, pharmaceuticals, food, feed and biofuels. Thus, further application of extremophiles has the potential to improve sustainability of existing biotechnological processes towards a greener biobased industry.",

One requisite to this end is the need for standards to measure and represent accurately biological functions, along with languages for data description and exchange. However, the inherent complexity of biological systems and the lack of quantitative tradition in the field have largely curbed this enterprise. Fortunately, the onset of systems and synthetic biology has emphasized the need for standards not only to manage omics data, but also to increase reproducibility and provide the means of engineering living systems in earnest. Some domains of biotechnology can be easily standardized (e.g. physical composition of DNA sequences, tools for genome editing, languages to encode workflows), while others might be standardized with some dedicated research (e.g. biological metrology, operative systems for bio-programming cells) and finally others will require a considerable effort, e.g. defining the rules that allow functional composition of biological activities.

The development of smart bioeconomies needs excellence in science-based concepts, long-term support of innovative and mission-oriented research and a subtle equilibrium between science push and market and social pull.

A key factor regarding VLP safety is the lack of viral genomic material, which enhances safety during both manufacture and administration. Contemporary VLP production may take advantage of several systems, including bacterial, yeast, insect and mammalian cells. The choice of production platform depends on several factors, including cost and the need for post-translational modifications (PTMs), which can be essential in generating an optimal immune response. Some VLP-based vaccines designed to prevent several infectious diseases are already approved and on the market, with many others at the clinical trial or research stage.

These pectinolytic phytopathogens are responsible for significant economic losses, mostly within the potato production sector. Importantly, there are no methods to eradicate these microorganisms once they have infected plant material. Solely preventive measures remain, including early detection and identification of the pathogens, monitoring of their spread in addition to planting certified seed material tested for latent infections. As proper identification of the causative agent allows for efficient limitation of disease spread, numerous detection and differentiation methods have been developed. Most commonly followed procedures involve: isolation of viable bacterial cells (alternatively post-enrichment) on semi-selective media, identification to species level by PCR (single, multiplex, Real time), serology or fatty acids profiling. Differentiation of the isolates is often accomplished by sequencing the housekeeping genes or molecular fingerprinting. In view of lowering total costs of next-generation sequencing (NGS), a huge amount of generated data reveals subtle differences between strains that have proven to be potentially useful for the establishment of specific novel detection pipelines. Successful implementation of molecular diagnostic methods is exemplified by 20-year studies on the populations of pectinolytic bacteria on potatoes in Poland. The presented work aims to gather the characteristics of Dickeya spp. and Pectobacterium spp. important for the identification process in addition to providing an overview of modern and newly developed specific, rapid, high-throughput and cost-effective screening methods for the detection and identification of these phytopathogens.",

     "abstract": "The integration of microbial technologies within the framework of the water-energy nexus has been taking place for over a century, but these mixed microbial communities are considered hard to deal with ‘black boxes’. Process steering is mainly based on avoiding process failure by monitoring conventional parameters, e.g., pH and temperature, which often leads to operation far below the intrinsic potential. Mixed microbial communities do not reflect a randomised individual mix, but an interacting microbiological entity. Advance monitoring to obtain effective engineering of the microbiome is achievable, and even crucial to obtain the desired performance and products. This can be achieved via a top-down or bottom-up approach. The top-down strategy is reflected in the microbial resource management concept that considers the microbial community as a well-structured network. This network can be monitored by means of molecular techniques that will allow the development of accurate and quick decision tools. In contrast, the bottom-up approach makes use of synthetic cultures that can be composed starting from defined axenic cultures, based on the requirements of the process under consideration. The success of both approaches depends on real-time monitoring and control. Of particular importance is the necessity to identify and characterise the key players in the process. These key players not only relate with the establishment of functional conversions, but also with the interaction between partner bacteria. This emphasises the importance of molecular (screening) techniques to obtain structural and functional insights, minimise energy input, and maximise product output by means of integrated microbiome processes.",

Hence, Notch signalling has gained increasing attention as a potential therapeutic target for many disorders. γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were the first therapeutics used to inhibit pathological Notch signalling in various diseases, notably in oncology. Although GSIs show antitumor activity in advanced and metastatic cancer, the lack of substrate specificity and associated toxicity constitute significant limitations to their therapeutic use. Antibodies have emerged as powerful therapeutics due to their specificity, efficacy and safety, and remarkable success has been achieved with their use in immune-mediated diseases and cancer.

Biofilm yields significantly declined when both of the components were withheld from the bioreactors or when both components were provided in excess. Stimulations to the reactors using NH4Cl significantly reduced the total carbon removal performance, while stimulations using KH2PO4 resulted in significant increases in performance. Chromatographic analyses showed that the NH4Cl stimulation enhanced the removal of saturated fatty amides and diethylene glycol butyl ether from the metalworking fluid, but inhibited the removal of diisoproponolamine. Furthermore, NH4Cl additions inhibited the oil/water separation carbon removal mechanism and resulted in the re-dispersion of recalcitrant organic material. The results from this study show that metalworking fluid practitioners should take care in choosing the nutrients used for stimulating bioreactor performance and microbe development.

     "abstract": "S-Adenosyl-l-homocysteine hydrolases (SAHases) are important metabolic enzymes and their dysregulation is associated with some severe diseases. In vivo they catalyze the hydrolysis of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH), the by-product of methylation reactions in various organisms. SAH is a potent inhibitor of methyltransferases, thus its removal from the equilibrium is an important requirement for methylation reactions. SAH hydrolysis is also the first step in the cellular regeneration process of the methyl donor S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM). However, in vitro the equilibrium lies towards the synthetic direction. To enable characterization of SAHases in the physiologically relevant direction, we have developed a coupled photometric assay that shifts the equilibrium towards hydrolysis by removing the product adenosine, using a high affinity adenosine kinase (AK). This converts adenosine to AMP and thereby forms equimolar amounts of ADP, which is phosphorylated by a pyruvate kinase (PK), in turn releasing pyruvate. The readout of the assay is the consumption of NADH during the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) catalyzed reduction of pyruvate to lactic acid. The applicability of the assay is showcased for the determination of the kinetic constants of an SAHase from Bradyrhizobium elkanii (KM,SAH 41 ± 5 μM, vmax,SAH 25 ± 1 μM/min with 0.13 mg/mL enzyme). This assay is a valuable tool for in vitro characterization of SAHases with biotechnological potential, and for monitoring SAHase activity in diagnostics.",

In this organism, the pentose phosphate pathway is the major source of NADPH for lipid biosynthesis. Thus, we over-expressed gene encoding NADP+-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (ZWF1) in a strain deficient in peroxisome biogenesis. However, this strategy suppressed growth during cultivation under lipogenic conditions and did not significantly increase lipid accumulation. Remarkably, co-expression of gene encoding acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP), which functions as an intracellular acyl-CoA transporter and acyl-CoA-pool former, restored growth. Co-expression of ZWF1 and ACBP increased the lipid content to 30% of dry cell weight via de novo lipid synthesis. In comparison to wild type, the engineered strain accumulated 41% more lipids with a higher ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids.",

Batch-production of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) presented an accumulation capacity in the high range (0.44 g/g) after 3 pulses of 50C mM, with a final content of 59% PHB/wt., for the culture selected with 50C mM/day and a 24 h cycle length. These values were in the range to those obtained with pure cultures and higher than the ones for MMC.

Results from the IVT procedure and the traditional methanolysis method were compared; the correlation between the two datasets was fit for the purpose, giving a R2 of 0.975. In search of further simplification, the rationale of IVT was exploited for the development of a “field method” based on the titration of thermolyzed samples with sodium hydrogen carbonate to quantify PHA inside bacterial cells. The accuracy of the IVT method was fit for the purpose.These results lead to the possibility for the on-line measurement of PHA productivity.

Furthermore the effects of surface chemistry were investigated by comparison of enzymatic hydrolysis by Thc_Cut1_PBM of “as received” PET TE membranes with two surface functionalized versions towards a “hydrophilic” and a more “hydrophobic” surface. The effects of adsorbed protein and the efficacy of cleaning steps after enzymatic treatment were elucidated by complementary methods for surface analysis and membrane characterization. With the optimized cleaning protocol, all adsorbed protein could be removed from the enzyme-treated membranes and effects of chemical surface functionalization of the PET TE membranes were demonstrated. The highest efficiency of enzymatic surface hydrolysis was observed for the original PET TE membranes, leading to an 0.36% weight loss corresponding to a removal of ∼3 nm PET from the entire surface of the porous membrane. This correlates very well with the measured increase of barrier pore diameter by 4 nm (a radius reduction? of 2 nm), leading to about a two-fold increased water permeability.",

Phenolic compounds solubilised by water enzyme-assisted and ethanol-based extractions of wet (WP) and dried (DP) pomace were characterised for composition and tested for antioxidant, anti-tyrosinase and anti-inflammatory bioactivities. Ethanol treatment led to higher phenol yields than water extraction, while DP samples showed the highest capacity of releasing polyphenols, most probably as a positive consequence of the pomace drying process. Different compositions and bioactivities were observed between water and ethanol extracts and among different treatments and for the first time the anti-tyrosinase activity of V. vinifera pomace extracts, was here reported. Enzymatic treatments did not significantly improve the total amount of solubilised compounds; Celluclast in DP led to the recovery of extracts enriched in specific compounds, when compared to control. The best extracts (enzymatic plus ethanol treatment total levels) were obtained from DP showing significantly higher amounts of polyphenols, flavonoids, flavanols and tannins and exerted higher antioxidant and anti-tyrosinase activities than WP total extracts. Conversely, anti-inflammatory capacity was only detected in water (with and without enzyme) extracts, with WP samples showing on average a higher activity than DP.

The presence of PHB granules enhanced survival of the bacteria after exposure to hypertonic conditions. Surprisingly, when coping with such conditions, the bacteria did not utilize PHB to harvest carbon or energy, suggesting that, in the osmotic upshock of C. necator, the protective mechanism of PHB granules is not associated with their hydrolysis. The presence of PHB granules influenced the overall properties of the cells, since challenged PHB-free cells underwent massive plasmolysis accompanied by damage to the cell membrane and the leakage of cytoplasm content, while no such effects were observed in PHB containing bacteria. Moreover, PHB granules demonstrated “liquid-like” properties indicating that they can partially repair and stabilize cell membranes by plugging small gaps formed during plasmolysis.

These scenarios encompass three production pathways covering three energy crops: palm oil (PO), microalgae in open ponds (M1) and microalgae in laminar photobioreactors (M2). We have applied Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA) methodology considering the Net Present Value (NPV) and the Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) as the main evaluation criteria. In terms of private investment, biodiesel production from PO is more attractive than from M2. However, regarding efficiency and effectiveness of public funds, M2 is superior to PO because the public BCR and NPV are higher, and the pressure on agricultural land is lower. Moreover, M2 as part of a systemic approach presents a better carbon balance. These findings show that, under a systemic approach based on circular economy, strategies like the one analyzed in this study are economically feasible and may have a promising future.",

     "abstract": "Certain species of plants can benefit from synergistic effects with plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) that improve plant growth and metal accumulation, mitigating toxic effects on plants and increasing their tolerance to heavy metals. The application of PGPR as biofertilizers and atmospheric nitrogen fixators contributes considerably to the intensification of the phytoremediation process. In this paper, we have built a system consisting of rhizospheric Azotobacter microbial populations and Lepidium sativum plants, growing in solutions containing heavy metals in various concentrations. We examined the ability of the organisms to grow in symbiosis so as to stimulate the plant growth and enhance its tolerance to Cr(VI) and Cd(II), to ultimately provide a reliable phytoremediation system. The study was developed at the laboratory level and, at this stage, does not assess the inherent interactions under real conditions occurring in contaminated fields with autochthonous microflora and under different pedoclimatic conditions and environmental stresses. Azotobacter sp. bacteria could indeed stimulate the average germination efficiency of Lepidium sativum by almost 7%, average root length by 22%, average stem length by 34% and dry biomass by 53%. The growth of L. sativum has been affected to a greater extent in Cd(II) solutions due its higher toxicity compared to that of Cr(VI). The reduced tolerance index (TI, %) indicated that plant growth in symbiosis with PGPR was however affected by heavy metal toxicity, while the tolerance of the plant to heavy metals was enhanced in the bacteria-plant system.A methodology based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and differential evolution (DE), specifically a neuro-evolutionary approach, was applied to model germination rates, dry biomass and root/stem length and proving the robustness of the experimental data. The errors associated with all four variables are small and the correlation coefficients higher than 0.98, which indicate that the selected models can efficiently predict the experimental data.",

Granulated activated carbon (GAC) and natural clinoptilolite (CLI) were activated using Cu2+- and Zn2+- ions and the disinfection ability of the resulting materials was tested. Studies of the sorption and desorption kinetics were performed in order to determine and clarify the antimicrobial activity of the metal-activated sorbents. The exact sorption capacities of the selected sorbents, GAC and CLI, activated through use of Cu2+- ions, were 15.90 and 3.60 mg/g, respectively, while for the materials activated by Zn2+- ions, the corresponding capacities were 14.00 and 4.72 mg/g,. The desorption rates were 2 and 3 orders of magnitude lower than their sorption efficacy for the Cu2+-, and Zn2+-activated sorbents, respectively. The intermediate sorption capacity and low desorption rate indicated that the overall antimicrobial activity of the metal-modified sorbents was a result of metal ions immobilized onto surface sites. The effect of antimicrobial activity of free ions desorbed from the metal-activated surface may thus be disregarded. The antimicrobial activities of Cu/GAC, Zn/GAC, Cu/CLI and Zn/CLI were also tested against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. After 15 min exposure, the highest levels of cell inactivation were obtained through the Cu/CLI and the Cu/GAC against E. coli, 100.0 and 98.24%, respectively. However, for S. aureus and yeast cell inactivation, all Cu2+- and Zn2+-activated sorbents proved to be unsatisfactory. A characterization of the sorbents was performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). A concentration of the adsorbed and released ions was determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

The accumulation of these elements on belowground and aboveground tissues was monitored during vegetative and senescence periods for two populations of P. australis, originally from contaminated (MIC) and non-contaminated (GAL) estuaries, respectively. The initial concentration of the elements in the contaminated estuarine sediment decreased in the following order: Fe > Mn > Zn > Pb > Ba > Cr > As > Cu > Ni > Co > Mo > Cd > Se > Hg. A similar trend was recorded in the belowground biomass following remediation, suggesting the potential role of P. australis as an effective biomonitoring tool. Hg was not detected in any plant tissue. An overall annual increase of concentration levels in belowground tissue was observed. Overall, this study suggested that P. australis populations from GAL were substantially more efficient in taking up Ni, Mo and Cr during the second annual cycle in both belowground and aboveground tissue than P. australis populations from MIC. Calculated bio-concentration factors (BCF) suggested a clear metal excluder strategy for Co, Cd, Pb, Cu and Fe, with accumulation and stabilisation belowground, with limited translocation into aerial tissues observed during the length of this study. An excluder behaviour for Zn, Ba and Mn was detected during the second annual cycle, coinciding with a substantial increase of concentration levels belowground. This study demonstrated for the first time the long term efficacy of P. australis for phytoremediation of heavy metal contaminated estuarine sediments.",

     "abstract": "A plant-assisted bioremediation strategy was applied in an area located in Southern Italy, close to the city of Taranto, historically contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and heavy metals. A specific poplar clone (Monviso) was selected for its ability to promote organic pollutant degradation in the rhizosphere, as demonstrated elsewhere. Chemical and microbiological analyses were performed at the time of poplar planting in selected plots at different distances from the trunk (0.25–1 m) and at different soil depths (0–20 and 20–40 cm), at day 420. A significant decrease in PCB congeners and a reduction in all heavy metals was observed where the poplar trees were present. No evidence of PCB and heavy metal reduction was observed in the non poplar-vegetated soil. Microbial analyses (dehydrogenase activity, cell viability, microbial abundance) of the autochthonous microbial community showed an improvement in soil quality. In particular, microbial activity generally increased in the poplar-rhizosphere and a positive effect was observed in some cases at up to 1 m distance from the trunk and up to 40 cm depth. The Monviso clone was effective in promoting both a general decrease in contaminant occurrence and an increase in microbial activity in the chronically polluted area a little more than one year after planting.",

L. sativum L. is sensitive to changes in environmental conditions and has been used in environmental tests. Its short vegetation period and ability to accumulate heavy metals make it suitable for use in repeated phytoextraction. The antioxidant enzymatic system of the plant (catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)) was analysed, to understand the effects of increasing Hg accumulation and translocation. Phytoextraction was repeated six times to decrease Hg contamination in soil, and the efficiency of each step was assessed. The results indicate that L. sativum L. is able to take up and accumulate Hg from contaminated soil. A corresponding increase in enzymatic antioxidants shows that the plant defence system is activated in response to Hg stress. Using compost and KI increases total Hg accumulation and translocation to the above-ground parts of L. sativum L. Repeating the process decreases Hg contamination in pot experiments in all variants of the process. The combined use of compost and KI during repeated phytoextraction increases the efficiency of Hg removal from contaminated soil.",

     "publication date": "09-2017",
     "abstract": "Bioremediation is an effective technology to tackle crude oil spill disasters, which takes advantage of the capacity of naturally occurring microorganisms to degrade petroleum hydrocarbons under a range of environmental conditions. The enzymatic process of breaking down oil is usually more rapid in the presence of oxygen. However, in contaminated sediments, oxygen levels are typically too low to sustain the rapid and complete biodegradation of buried hydrocarbons. Here, we explored the possibility to electrochemically manipulate the redox potential of a crude oil-contaminated marine sediment in order to establish, in situ, conditions that are conducive to contaminants biodegradation by autochthonous microbial communities. The proposed approach is based on the exploitation of low-voltage (2 V) seawater electrolysis to drive oxygen generation (while minimizing chlorine evolution) on Dimensionally Stable Anodes (DSA) placed within the contaminated sediment. Results, based on a laboratory scale setup with chronically polluted sediments spiked with crude oil, showed an increased redox potential and a decreased pH in the vicinity of the anode of ‘electrified’ treatments, consistent with the occurrence of oxygen generation. Accordingly, hydrocarbons biodegradation was substantially accelerated (up to 3-times) compared to ‘non-electrified’ controls, while sulfate reduction was severely inhibited. Intermittent application of electrolysis proved to be an effective strategy to minimize the energy requirements of the process, without adversely affecting degradation performance. Taken as a whole, this study suggests that electrolysis-driven bioremediation could be a sustainable technology for the management of contaminated sediments.",

     "abstract": "The analysis of stable carbon isotopes for the assessment of contaminant fate in the aquifer is impeded in the case of petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) by their chain length. Alternatively, the coupled nitrogen–sulfur–carbon cycles involved into TPH biodegradation under sulfate- and nitrate reducing conditions can be investigated using nitrogen (δ15N) and sulfur (δ34S) isotopic shifts in terminal electron acceptors (TEA) involved in anaerobic TPH oxidation. Biodegradation of a paraffin-rich crude oil was studied in anaerobic aquifer microcosms with nitrate (NIT), sulfate (SUL), nitrate plus sulfate (MIX) and nitrate under sulfate reduction suppression by molybdate (MOL) as TEA. After 8 months, TPH biodegradation was not different (around 33%) in experiments receiving only nitrate (NIT, MOL) versus under mixed TEA-conditions (MIX), despite higher biodiversity under mixed conditions (H′NIT and H′MOL ≈ 5.9, H′MIX = 8.0). Molybdate addition effected higher nitrate depletion, possibly by increasing the production of nitrate reductase. Additional sulfate depletion under mixed conditions suggested bioconversion of polar intermediates. Microcosms only receiving sulfate (SUL) showed no significant TEA and TPH decrease. A Rayleigh kinetic isotope enrichment model for isotopic 15N/14N and 34S/32S shifts in residual TEA gave apparent enrichment factors ɛN,NIT and ɛN,MOL values of −16.7 to −18.0‰ for nitrate as sole TEA and ɛN,MIX of −6.0‰ and ɛS,MIX of −4.1‰ under mixed electron accepting conditions. The low isotopic fractionation under mixed terminal electron accepting conditions was attributed to lithotrophic, sulfide-dependent denitrification by Thiobacillus species, while it was hypothesized that Desulfovibrio replenished the reduced sulfur pool via oxidation of polar hydrocarbon metabolites. Concurrently, organotrophic denitrification was performed by Pseudomonas species, with isotopic fractionation expressed by ɛN,MIX representing the superposition of both denitrification processes. This is, to our knowledge, the first characterization of sulfur and nitrogen isotopic shifts associated to concurrent organotrophic and lithotrophic denitrification in a hydrocarbon-contaminated environment, and offers the prospect of improved understanding of biogeochemical cycles including in situ hydrocarbon biotransformation.",

     "abstract": "Large amounts of polystyrene (PS), one of the most widely used plastics in the world, end up in the environment through industrial discharge and littering, becoming one of the major components of plastic debris. Such plastics, especially the small-sized microplastics and nanoplastics, have received increasing concerns in terms of their potential environmental risks. Feasible approaches for the degradation of PS in waste materials and in the environment are highly desirable. Physicochemical pretreatments of PS may be applied to enhance biological degradation. In the present study, we synthesized 14C-labelled PS polymers, either uniformly labelled on the ring ([U-ring-14C]-PS) or labelled at the β-carbon position of the alkyl chain ([β-14C]-PS), and investigated the mineralisation of the 14C-PS polymers by the fungus Penicillium variabile CCF3219 as well as the effect of ozonation as a physico-chemical pre-treatment on the mineralisation by the fungi. Biodegradation of the 14C-PS polymers was studied in liquid medium (pH 7.5, without additional carbon substrate) with P. variabile for 16 weeks. During the incubation time, 14CO2 was captured to calculate the mineralisation of 14C-PS and the remaining polymers were analysed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry and gel-permeation chromatography (GPC). The results showed that the fungi mineralised both labelled polymers, and that the [U-ring-14C]-PS with a lower molecular weight led to a higher mineralisation rate. Ozonation pre-treatment strongly enhanced mineralisation of [β-14C]-PS. SEM analysis showed that the surface of the ozonated [β-14C]-PS became uneven and rough after the incubation, indicating an attack on the polymer by P. variabile. FT-IR analysis showed that ozonation generated carbonyl groups on the [β-14C]-PS and the amount of the carbonyl groups decreased after incubation of the [β-14C]-PS with P. variabile. GPC analysis showed that the molecular weights of the ozonated [β-14C]-PS decreased after incubation. The present data suggest that ozonation pretreatment could be a potential approach for degradation of PS waste and remediation of PS-contaminated sites.",

To be compatible with live cells, side chains of Uaas have been limited to either chemically inert or bio-orthogonal (i.e., nonreactive toward biomolecules) functionalities. To introduce bioreactivity into live systems, the genetic code has recently been engineered to encode a new class of Uaas, the bioreactive Uaas. These Uaas, after being incorporated into proteins, specifically react with target natural amino acid residues via proximity-enabled bioreactivity, enabling the selective formation of new covalent linkages within and between proteins both in vitro and in live systems. The new covalent bonding ability has been harnessed within proteins to enhance photostability, increase thermostability, staple proteins recombinantly, and build optical nano-switches, and between proteins to pinpoint ligand-receptor interaction, target native receptors irreversibly, and generate covalent macromolecular inhibitors. These diverse bioreactivities, inaccessible to natural proteins, thus open doors to novel protein engineering and provide new avenues for biological studies, biotherapeutics and synthetic biology.",

Recombinant enzyme production on the 5-L bioreactor scale (Rs pCAE: 3245 U L−1) exceeded the productivity of the wild type strain by a factor of 800. Based on substrate specificity profiling, the purified recombinant Rs pCAE was classified as a p-coumaroyl esterase (pCAE) with a pronounced chlorogenic acid esterase side activity. The Rs pCAE was also active on methyl cinnamate, caffeate and ferulate and on feruloylated saccharides. The unprecedented substrate profile of Rs pCAE together with the lack of sequence similarity to known FAEs or pCAEs suggested that the Rs pCAE represents a new type of enzyme. Hydroxycinnamic acids were released from agro-industrial side-streams, such as destarched wheat bran (DSWB), sugar beet pectin (SBP) and coffee pulp (CP). Overnight incubation of coffee pulp with the Rs pCAE resulted in the efficient release of p-coumaric (100%), caffeic (100%) and ferulic acid (85%) indicating possible applications for the valorization of food processing wastes and for the enhanced degradation of lignified biomass.",

Traditionally, the search for microorganisms suitable for bioremediation has been based on the selection of isolated strains able to remove a specific type of pollutant. However, this strategy has now become obsolete, since co-pollution is a global reality. Thus, current studies attempt to find bacterial cultures capable of coping with a mixture of organic and inorganic compounds. In this sense, the bacterial consortium SFC 500-1 has demonstrated efficiency for Cr(VI) and phenol removal, both of which are found in many industrial wastewaters. In the present study, the ability of SFC 500-1 for simultaneous removal was improved through its entrapment in a Ca-alginate matrix. This strategy led to an increased removal of Cr(VI), which was partially reduced to Cr(III). Immobilised cells were able to tolerate and degrade phenol up to 1,500 mg/l at high rates, forming catechol and cis,cis-muconate as oxidation intermediates. Successful removal potential through 5 cycles of reuse, as well as after long-term storage, was another important advantage of the immobilised consortium. These characteristics make SFC 500-1 an interesting system for potential application in the biotreatment of co-polluted effluents.",

The results indicated that the unstructured growth model can be used to evaluate lactate producing fermentation. Under the experimental fermentation conditions, one strain showed the ability to tolerate a high lignin concentration (2.5 g/L) but lacked the capacity for sufficient pentose uptake.

Butanol has fuel properties almost on a par with gasoline, such as high energy content, low vapor pressure, non-hygroscopic nature, less volatility, flexible fuel blends and high octane number. The paper reviews some recent advances in acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation with special emphasis on the primary challenges encountered in butanol fermentation, including butanol toxicity, solvent intolerance and bacteriophage contamination. The mechanisms for butanol recovery techniques have been covered along with their benefits and limitations. A comprehensive discussion of genetic and metabolic engineering of butanol-producing microorganisms is made for the prospective development of industrially-relevant strains that can overcome the technical challenges involved in efficient butanol production.",

Presently, all commercially available alginates are manufactured from brown algae. However, bacterial alginates have advantages with regard to compositional homogeneity and reproducibility. In order to be able to design bacterial strains that are better suited for industrial alginate production, defining limiting factors for alginate biosynthesis is of vital importance. Our group has been studying alginate biosynthesis in Pseudomonas fluorescens using several complementary approaches. Alginate is synthesised and transported out of the cell by a multiprotein complex spanning from the inner to the outer membrane. We have developed an immunogold labelling procedure in which the porin AlgE, as a part of this alginate factory, could be detected by transmission electron microscopy. No time-dependent correlation between the number of such factories on the cell surface and alginate production level was found in alginate-producing strains.Alginate biosynthesis competes with the central carbon metabolism for the key metabolite fructose 6-phosphate. In P. fluorescens, glucose, fructose and glycerol, are metabolised via the Entner-Doudoroff and pentose phosphate pathways. Mutational analysis revealed that disruption of the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase gene zwf-1 resulted in increased alginate production when glycerol was used as carbon source. Furthermore, alginate-producing P. fluorescens strains cultivated on glucose experience acid stress due to the simultaneous production of alginate and gluconate. The combined results from our studies strongly indicate that the availability of fructose 6-phosphate and energy requires more attention in further research aimed at the development of an optimised alginate production process.",

Research efforts have been directed towards establishing technical feasibility in the use of mixed microbial cultures (MMC) for PHA production using residuals as feedstock, mainly consisting of industrial process effluent waters and wastewaters. In this context, PHA production can be integrated with waste and wastewater biological treatment, with concurrent benefits of resource recovery and sludge minimization.Over the past 15 years, much of the research on MMC PHA production has been performed at laboratory scale in three process elements as follows: (1) acidogenic fermentation to obtain a volatile fatty acid (VFA)-rich stream, (2) a dedicated biomass production yielding MMCs enriched with PHA-storing potential, and (3) a PHA accumulation step where (1) and (2) outputs are combined in a final biopolymer production bioprocess. This paper reviews the recent developments on MMC PHA production from synthetic and real wastewaters. The goals of the critical review are: a) to highlight the progress of the three-steps in MMC PHA production, and as well to recommend room for improvements, and b) to explore the ideas and developments of integration of PHA production within existing infrastructure of municipal and industrial wastewaters treatment. There has been much technical advancement of ideas and results in the MMC PHA rich biomass production. However, clear demonstration of production and recovery of the polymers within a context of product quality over an extended period of time, within an up-scalable commercially viable context of regional material supply, and with well-defined quality demands for specific intent of material use, is a hill that still needs to be climbed in order to truly spur on innovations for this field of research and development.",

They share a similar genome size and a high proteome similarity. P. corrugata produces many biomolecules which play an important role in bacterial cell survival and fitness. Both species produce different medium-chain-length PHAs (mcl-PHAs) from the bioconversion of glycerol to a transparent film in P. mediterranea and a sticky elastomer in P. corrugata. In this work, using RNA-seq we investigated the transcriptional profiles of both bacteria at the early stationary growth phase with glycerol as the carbon source. Quantitative analysis of P. mediterranea transcripts versus P. corrugata revealed that 1756 genes were differentially expressed. A total of 175 genes were significantly upregulated in P. mediterranea, while 217 were downregulated. The largest group of upregulated genes was related to transport systems and stress response, energy and central metabolism, and carbon metabolism. Expression levels of most genes coding for enzymes related to PHA biosynthesis and central metabolic pathways showed no differences or only slight variations in pyruvate metabolism. The most relevant result was the significantly increased expression in P. mediterranea of genes involved in alginate production, an important exopolysaccharide, which in other Pseudomonas spp. plays a key role as a virulence factor or in stress tolerance and shows many industrial applications. In conclusion, the results provide useful information on the co-production of mcl-PHAs and alginate from glycerol as carbon source by P. mediterranea in the design of new strategies of genetic regulation to improve the yield of bioproducts or bacterial fitness.",

In a previous paper [Broeren et al., 2016], LCA results per kg and per functionality equivalent of bio-based plastics were presented, together with economic considerations. The present paper discusses the mechanical and thermal properties of a range of commercially available bio-based plastics based on polylactic acid (PLA), cellulose esters, starch and polyamides, and the feasibility of replacing fossil-based counterparts based on performance. The evaluation is approached from an end user perspective. First, potentially suitable bio-based plastics are selected based on manufacturers’ specifications in technical data sheets, then a first experimental evaluation is performed on injection moulded ISO specimens, and finally a further selection of plastics is tested on large 50 × 70 cm panels. This technical feasibility study indicates that so far bio-based plastics do not completely match the properties of high performance materials like flame retardant V-0 PC/ABS blends used in electronic devices. The performance gap is being decreased by the development of stereocomplex PLA and hybrid PLA blends with polycarbonate, which offer clearly improved properties with respect to maximum usage temperature and toughness. In addition, several materials meet the V-0 flammability requirements needed in specific durable applications. On the other hand, improving these properties so far has negative consequences for the bio-based content. This study also shows that replacement of bulk polymers like PS is feasible using PLA compounds with a bio-based content as high as 85%.",

     "abstract": "A pilot-scale study aiming to evaluate the potential use of poly-3-hydroxy-butyrate (PHB) as an electron donor source for in situ bioremediation of chlorinated hydrocarbons in groundwater was conducted. Compared with commercially available electron donors, PHB offers a restricted fermentation pathway (i.e., through acetic acid and molecular hydrogen) by avoiding the formation of any residual carbon that could potentially spoil groundwater quality. The pilot study was carried out at an industrial site in Italy, heavily contaminated by different chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs). Prior to field testing, PHB was experimentally verified as a suitable electron donor for biological reductive dechlorination processes at the investigated site by microcosm studies carried out on site aquifer material and measuring the quantitative transformation of detected CAHs to ethene. Owing to the complex geological characteristics of the aquifer, the use of a groundwater circulation well (GCW) was identified as a potential strategy to enable effective delivery and distribution of electron donors in less permeable layers and to mobilise contaminants. A 3-screened, 30-m-deep GCW coupled with an external treatment unit was installed at the site. The effect of PHB fermentation products on the in situ reductive dechlorination processes were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The results from the first 4 months of operation clearly demonstrated that the PHB fermentation products were effectively delivered to the aquifer and positively influenced the biological dechlorination activity. Indeed, an increased abundance of Dehalococcoides mccartyi (up to 6.6 fold) and reduced CAH concentrations at the installed monitoring wells were observed.",

     "abstract": "Production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) by open mixed microbial cultures (MMCs) has been attracting increasing interest as an alternative technology to PHA production by pure cultures, due to the potential for lower costs associated with the use of open systems (eliminating the requirement for sterile conditions) and the utilisation of cheap feedstock (industrial and agricultural wastes). Such technology relies on the efficient selection of an MMC enriched in PHA-accumulating organisms. Fermented cheese whey, a protein-rich complex feedstock, has been used previously to produce PHA using the feast and famine regime for selection of PHA accumulating cultures. While this selection strategy was found efficient when operated at relatively low organic loading rate (OLR, 2 g-COD L−1 d−1), great instability and low selection efficiency of PHA accumulating organisms were observed when higher OLR (ca. 6 g-COD L−1 d−1) was applied. High organic loading is desirable as a means to enhance PHA productivity. In the present study, a new selection strategy was tested with the aim of improving selection for high OLR. It was based on uncoupling carbon and nitrogen supply and was implemented and compared with the conventional feast and famine strategy. For this, two selection reactors were fed with fermented cheese whey applying an OLR of ca. 8.5 g-COD L−1 (with 3.8 g-COD L−1 resulting from organic acids and ethanol), and operated in parallel under similar conditions, except for the timing of nitrogen supplementation. Whereas in the conventional strategy nitrogen and carbon substrates were added simultaneously at the beginning of the cycle, in the uncoupled substrates strategy, nitrogen addition was delayed to the end of the feast phase (i.e. after exogenous carbon was exhausted). The two different strategies selected different PHA-storing microbial communities, dominated by Corynebacterium and a Xantomonadaceae, respectively with the conventional and the new approaches. The new strategy originated a more efficient PHA-production process than the conventional one (global PHA productivity of 6.09 g-PHA L−1 d−1 and storage yield of 0.96 versus 2.55 g-PHA L−1 d−1 and 0.86, respectively). Dissociation between the feast to famine length ratio (F/F) and storage efficiency was shown to be possible with the new strategy, allowing selection of an efficient PHA-storing culture with complex feedstock under high organic loading rates.",

Furthermore, the sterilisation and storage of nanocarrier formulations represents a complicated but mandatory step for their effective use. In our previous work we assessed the use of an autoclaving process to achieve, in one simple step, sterile self-assembled hyaluronan-cholesterol (HA-CH) and hyaluronan-riboflavin (HA-Rfv) nanohydrogels (NHs). In the present work, the effect of the high temperature on HA-CH has been studied in detail. HA-CH suspensions were characterised in terms of size and polydispersity by Dynamic Light Scattering at different temperatures and conditions; the HA-CH chemical structure and its molecular weight were assessed via FT-IR and GPC analysis after the sterilising cycle in an autoclave at 121 °C for 20 min. The obtained NHs were then observed with TEM and AFM microscopy, in both dry and liquid conditions. The Young’s modulus of the NHs was determined, evidencing the soft nature of these nanosystems; the critical aggregation concentration (c.a.c) of the nanosuspension was also assessed. Thereafter, alginate lyase (AL) was conjugated to NHs, with the aim of developing a useful system for therapies against bacterial infections producing alginate biofilms. The conjugation efficiency and the enzymatic activity of AL were determined after immobilisation. The AL-NHs system showed the ability to depolymerise alginate, offering an opportunity to be a useful nanosystem for the treatment of biofilm-associated infections.",

     "abstract": "A sequencing batch reactor (SBR) is typically used for selecting mixed microbial cultures (MMC) for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production. Since many waste streams suitable as process feedstock for PHA production are nitrogen-deficient, a nutrient supply in the SBR is typically required to allow for efficient microbial growth. The scope of this study was to devise a nitrogen feeding strategy which allows controlling the nitrogen levels during the feast and famine regime of a lab-scale SBR, thereby selecting for PHA-storing microorganisms. At the beginning of the cycle the reactor was fed with a synthetic mixture of acetic and propionic acids at an overall organic load rate of 8.5 gCOD L−1 d−1 (i.e. 260 Cmmol L−1 d−1), whereas nitrogen (in the form of ammonium sulphate) was added either simultaneously to the carbon feed (coupled feeding strategy) or after the end of the feast phase (uncoupled feeding strategy). As a main result, PHA production was more than doubled (up to about 1300 ± 64 mgCOD L−1) when carbon and nitrogen were separately fed and the higher PHA production also corresponded to an 82% increase in the polymer HV content (up to 20 ± 1%, wt wt−1). Three SBR runs were performed with the uncoupled carbon and nitrogen feeding at different carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios (of 14.3, 17.9, and 22.3 Cmol Nmol−1, respectively) which were varied by progressively reducing the concentration of the nitrogen feeding. In spite of a comparable PHA storage yield at 14.3 and 17.9 Cmol Nmol−1 (0.41 ± 0.05 gCODPHA gCODVFA−1 and 0.38 ± 0.05 gCODPHA gCODVFA−1, respectively), the storage response of the selected MMC significantly decreased when the C/N ratio was set at the highest investigated value. Notably, an increase in this parameter also resulted in a change in the HV content in the polymer regardless the composition of the organic acids solution.",

MMC PHA production is commonly carried out in a 3-stage process of acidogenesis, PHA culture selection and accumulation. This research focused on the possibility of tailoring PHA by controlling the acidogenic reactor operating conditions, namely pH, using cheese whey as model feedstock. The objective was to investigate the impact that dynamically varying the acidogenic pH, when targeting different PHA monomer profiles, had on the performance and microbial community profile of the anaerobic reactor. To accomplish this, an anaerobic reactor was continuously operated under dynamic pH changes, ranging from pH 4 to 7, turning to pH 6 after each change of pH. At pH 6, lactate and acetate were the dominant products (41–48% gCOD basis and 22–44% gCOD basis, respectively). At low pH, lactate production was higher while at high pH acetate production was favoured. Despite the dynamic change of pH, the fermentation product composition at pH 6 was always similar, showing the resilience of the process, i.e. when the same pH value was imposed, the culture produced the same metabolic products independently of the history of changes occurring in the system. The different fermentation product fractions led to PHAs of different compositions. The microbial community, analysed by high throughput sequencing of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene fragments, was dominated by Lactobacillus, but varied markedly when subjected to the highest and lowest pH values of the tested range (4 and 7), with increase in the abundance of Lactococcus and a member of the Candidate Division TM7. Different bacterial profiles obtained at pH 6 during this dynamic operation were able to produce a consistent profile of fermentation products (and consequently a constant PHA composition), demonstrating the community’s functional redundancy.",

However, they cannot be used directly in highly productive industrial poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB) production, as the classical fed-batch fermentation strategy requires highly concentrated feed streams. This problem has been circumvented in this report by retaining the cells during the fermentation in the bioreactor using an external microfiltration module. Synthetic medium containing a glucose concentration of 50 g/L was continuously fed to Cupriavidus necator, which converted the sugar to P3HB. With this setup we were able to achieve high productivities (3.10 g P3HB/(L h)) and reach high cell densities (148 g/L) containing 76% P3HB, and obtained good yields (0.33 g P3HB/g added glucose). The added sugar from the feed was instantly consumed by the bacteria, resulting in a negligible loss of sugar to the permeate. This approach creates the possibility of polyhydroxyalkanoate production from a range of cheap and easily available substrates, for which only waste water treatment or biogas production has been cost-competitive until now.",

In this work, a biocatalytic approach has been used for the synthesis of an Fmoc-tripeptide that is able to self-assemble in water affording a self-supporting hydrogel. The mechanical properties of this material have been enhanced through chemical crosslinking by using a natural compound, genipin, that allows to minimize cytotoxic effects. Moreover, we have tested the potential of the prepared materials to be employed as drug delivery systems using naproxen as an anti-inflammatory model drug, and studying its release kinetics in aqueous medium. The cytotoxicity of the hydrogels has been evaluated, and their mechanical and morphological properties have been studied by rheology and SEM microscopy.",

For each cultural condition, we (i) evaluated growth kinetics and measured the cell metabolic activity by MTT assay, (ii) monitored PHA production and (iii) estimated the expression of phaC1 and phaC2 genes through RT-PCR. Our results show that the use of glutamine as co-feeder in P. mediterranea led to an improvement of the specific growth rate and cell metabolic activity and enhanced the uptake of all the carbon sources assayed. Moreover, the use of glutamine reduced significantly the time required for PHA production and increased biopolymer yield, as consequence of an early activation of phaC1 and phaC2.",

     "abstract": "A pure culture of the filamentous bacterium Thiothrix, strain CT3, was aerobically cultured in a chemostat under continuous acetate feeding at three different culture residence times (RT 6, 12 or 22 d) and the same volumetric organic load rate (OLR 0.12 gCOD/L/d).Cells cultured at decreasing RT in the chemostat had an increasing transient response to acetate spikes in batch tests. The maximum specific acetate removal rate increased from 25 to 185 mgCOD/gCOD/h, corresponding to a 1.8 to 8.1 fold higher respective steady-state rate in the chemostat. The transient response was mainly due to acetate storage in the form of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), whereas no growth response was observed at any RT. Interestingly, even though the storage rate also decreased as the RT increased, the storage yield increased from 0.41 to 0.50 COD/COD. This finding does not support the traditional view that storage plays a more important role as the transient response increases.The transient response of the steady-state cells was much lower than in cells cultured under periodic feeding (at 6 d RT, from 82 to 247 mgCOD/gCOD/h), with the latter cells showing both storage and growth responses. On the other hand, even though steady-state cells had no growth response and their storage rate was also less, steady-state cells showed a higher storage yield than cells cultured under dynamic feeding. This suggests that in Thiothrix strain CT3, the growth response is triggered by periodic feeding, whereas the storage response is a constitutive mechanism, independent from previous acclimation to transient conditions.",

Initial screening methods (oil spreading, drop collapse, haemolytic activity and emulsification activity) showed that approximately 36% of the 51 isolated cultures exhibited the ability to produce biosurfactants. Subsequent studies using a selected culturable mixed culture (which included Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) revealed that only P. aeruginosa was able to produce this biosurfactant. HPLC–MS analysis showed that the surface active compounds were rhamnolipids. Further comparative studies confirmed that the total yield of rhamnolipids was notably higher in the bioreactor inoculated with the selected mixed culture (940.58 ± 1.10 mg/L) compared to the bioreactor inoculated with the axenic strain of P. aeruginosa (108.47 ± 0.41 mg/L). Twelve rhamnolipid congeners were identified during cultivation of the selected mixed culture, whereas six congeners were detected during cultivation of the sole axenic strain of P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, increased production of rhamnolipids was observed when the concentration of autoinducer molecules (AI-2) responsible for interspecies signaling increased, suggesting the influence of quorum-sensing communication on biosynthesis efficiency. This observation may be of importance for large-scale production of this biosurfactant, as it opens new possible solutions based on the use of mixed cultures or external addition of stimulating autoinducers.",

One of the main limiting factors for scaled up production and downstream applications of rhamnolipids is the fact that they are predominantly produced from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this article, we have reported the production and characterisation of long chain rhamnolipids from non-pathogenic Burkholderia thailandensis E264 (ATCC 700388). We have also investigated the antibacterial and antibiofilm properties of these rhamnolipids against some oral pathogens (Streptococcus oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Neisseria mucosa and Streptococcus sanguinis), important for oral health and hygiene. Treating these bacteria with different concentrations of long chain rhamnolipids resulted in a reduction of 3–4 log of bacterial viability, placing these rhamnolipids close to being classified as biocidal. Investigating long chain rhamnolipid efficacy as antibiofilm agents for prospective oral-related applications revealed good potency against oral-bacteria biofilms in a co-incubation experiments, in a pre-coated surface format, in disrupting immature biofilms and has shown excellent combination effect with Lauryl Sodium Sulphate which resulted in a drastic decrease in its minimal inhibitory concentration against different bacteria. Investigating the rhamnolipid permeabilization effect along with their ability to induce the formation of reactive oxygen species has shed light on the mechanism through which inhibition/killing of bacteria may occur.",

Differentially fixed and paraffin embedded tissue pairs were sectioned and pathological review was performed according to the Prosigna assay protocol. RNA was isolated using the Prosigna assay kit and analyzed using the NanoString nCounter Dx Analysis system. 47 of the 50 blocks (94%) passed RNA quality control (QC) criteria and were collectively designated as the analysis set.We found that RNA yield and purity (A260/A280) were not significantly different between the fixatives within the analysis set. In the analysis of ROR score, the tissue pairs had a Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.91, similar to the correlation observed between paired tissue blocks using a single fixative in previous studies. Subtype concordance between differentially fixed tissue pairs was high (K = 0.80). No significant bias or variability in risk of recurrence (ROR) score attributable to fixative was detected in this study. Further analysis revealed that sample pairs with larger differences in ROR score were limited to nearly-depleted tissue blocks containing large amounts of normal tissue due to proximity of the tumor margin. The results of this study demonstrate that the fixative, AFA, does not contribute significantly to bias and variability of assay results.",

Intracellular and extracellular constituents were monitored in batch tests under different electron donor and acceptor conditions and specific oxygen and nitrogen uptake rates were evaluated. Results showed that phosphorus uptake was inhibited during the simultaneous presence of electron donor (acetate) and acceptor (O2/NO3−) in the mixed liquor. In the presence of acetate, PHAs and glycogen were produced under both aerobic and anoxic conditions irrespectively to the PHAs amount already stored intracellularly. The Krebs cycle reactions and oxidative phosphorylation provided the reduced coenzymes and energy required for PHAs synthesis when biomass polyphosphate content was low. On the contrary, polyphosphate cleavage provided the ATP required for PHAs synthesis in the presence of high biomass polyphosphate content. Inhibition of the respiratory chain reactions was observed when biomass with high polyphosphate and low PHAs content was subjected to simultaneous presence of electron donor and acceptor. PHAs utilization rather than glycogen degradation appears to favor phosphate accumulation since no polyphosphate synthesis occurred in the absence of PHAs reserves.",

This heterologous expression was tested in several E. coli mutant backgrounds with increased availability of C4 intermediates. It was found that this metabolic rewiring improved the synthesis of the target products in several mutants, with the dcuD mutant being the most suitable background for hydrogen and ethanol specific productions and glycerol consumption.

However, no specific antibacterial VOCs have been identified to date. The purpose of the present study was to identify specific VOCs that contribute to Bcc inhibition by the Antarctic strain. When grown on defined medium containing D-gluconate and L-glutamate as carbon, nitrogen and energy sources, P. haloplanktis TAC125 is unable to inhibit the growth of Bcc strains. However, single addition of several amino acids to the defined medium restores the P. haloplanktis TAC125 inhibition ability. With the aim of identifying specific volatile compound/s responsible for Bcc inhibition, we set up an apparatus for VOC capture, accumulation, and storage. P. haloplanktis TAC125 was grown in an automatic fermenter which was connected to a cooling system to condense VOCs present in the exhaust air outlet. Upon addition of methionine to the growth medium, the VOC methylamine was produced by P. haloplanktis TAC125. Methylamine was found to inhibit the growth of several Bcc strains in a dose-dependent way. Although it was reported that P. haloplanktis TAC125 produces VOCs endowed with antimicrobial activity, this is the first demonstration that methylamine probably contributes to the anti-Bcc activity of P. haloplanktis TAC125 VOCs.",

     "abstract": "Umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation is associated with long periods of aplastic anaemia. This undesirable situation is due to the low cell dose available per unit of UCB and the immaturity of its progenitors. To overcome this, we present a cell culture strategy aimed at the expansion of the CD34+ population and the generation of granulocyte lineage-committed progenitors. Two culture products were produced after either 6 or 14 days of in vitro expansion, and their characteristics compared to non-expanded UCB CD34+ controls in terms of phenotype, colony-forming activity and multilineage repopulation potential in NOD-scid IL2Rγnull mice. Both expanded cell products maintained rapid SCID repopulation activity similar to the non-expanded control, but 14-day cultured cells showed impaired long term SCID repopulation activity. The process was successfully scaled up to clinically relevant doses of 89 × 106 CD34+ cells committed to the granulocytic lineage and 3.9 × 109 neutrophil precursors in different maturation stages. Cell yields and biological properties presented by the cell product obtained after 14 days in culture were superior and therefore this is proposed as the preferred production setup in a new type of dual transplant strategy to reduce aplastic periods, producing a transient repopulation before the definitive engraftment of the non-cultured UCB unit. Importantly, human telomerase reverse transcriptase activity was undetectable, c-myc expression levels were low and no genetic abnormalities were found, as determined by G-banding karyotype, further confirming the safety of the expanded product.",

A deeper understanding of microbial responses to stress is indeed attainable only considering the phenomenon as a whole. Exhaustive knowledge of the various stress response systems, and of their interconnections, is important for different applications, from the prevention and counteraction of bacterial infectious diseases to the engineering of robust cell factories. The presentations covered all of these aspects, enabling an active interaction among participants. It also stimulated discussions and cross-fertilisation among disciplines, which was one of the aims of the meeting.

The process comprised steps for pre-denitrification, nitrification and post-denitrification and included integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) with biofilm carrier media to support nitrification. In a pilot-scale demonstration (500–800 L), wastewater treatment performance, in line with European standards, were achieved for total chemical oxygen demand (83% removal) and total nitrogen (80% removal) while producing a biomass that was able to accumulate up to 49% PHA of volatile suspended solids with acetic acid or fermented organic residues as substrates. Robust performance in wastewater treatment and enrichment of PHA-producing biomass was demonstrated under realistic conditions including influent variability during 225 days of operation. The IFAS system was found to be advantageous since maintaining nitrification on the biofilm allowed for a relatively low (2 days) solids retention time (SRT) for the suspended biomass in the bulk phase. Lower SRT has advantages in higher biomass yield and higher active fraction in the biomass which leads to higher PHA productivity and content. The outcomes show that production of added-value biopolymers may be readily integrated with carbon and nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater.",

Plants were transformed with combinations of the CzcC, CzcB and CzcA genes, and the impact on Cd mobilization was analysed. Plants expressing PpCzcC showed no differences in Cd accumulation, whereas those expressing PpCzcB or PpCzcA accumulated less Cd in the shoots, but more Cd in the roots. Plants expressing both PpCzcB and PpCzcA accumulated less Cd in the shoots and roots compared to controls, whereas plants expressing all three genes showed a significant reduction in Cd levels only in shoots. These results show that components of the CzcCBA system can be expressed in plants and may be useful for developing plants with a reduced capacity to accumulate Cd in the shoots, potentially reducing the toxicity of food/feed crops cultivated in Cd-contaminated soils.",

The meeting presented numerous methods for the development of novel synthetic strains, synthetic biological tools and synthetic biology applications. With the aid of synthetic biology, production costs of chemicals, metabolites and food products are expected to decrease, by generating sustainable biochemical production of such resources. Also, such synthetic biological advances could be applied for medical purposes, as in pharmaceuticals and for biosensors. Recurrent, linked themes throughout the meeting were the shortage of resources, the world’s transition into a bioeconomy, and how synthetic biology is helping tackle these issues through cutting-edge technologies. While there are still limitations in synthetic biology research, innovation is propelling the development of technology, the standardisation of synthetic biological tools and the use of suitable host organisms.

Two Burkholderia fungorum strains (B. fungorum DBT1 and B. fungorum 95) were monitored during their growth for both capacity and efficiency of selenite (SeO32−) reduction and elemental selenium formation. Both strains are environmental isolates in origin: B. fungorum DBT1 was previously isolated from an oil refinery drainage, while B. fungorum 95 has been enriched from inner tissues of hybrid poplars grown in a soil contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Our results showed that B. fungorum DBT1 is able to reduce 0.5 mM SeO32− to Se° when cultured aerobically in liquid medium at 27 °C, while B. fungorum 95 can reduce more than 1 mM SeO32− to Se° within 96 h under the same growth conditions, with the appearance of SeNPs in cultures of both bacterial strains. Biogenic SeNPs were spherical, with pH-dependent charge and an average hydrodynamic diameter of 170 nm and 200 nm depending on whether they were produced by B. fungorum 95 or B. fungorum DBT1, respectively. Electron microscopy analyses evidenced that Se nanoparticles occurred intracellularly and extracellularly. The mechanism of SeNPs formation can be tentatively attributed to cytoplasmic enzymatic activation mediated by electron donors. Biogenic nanoparticles were then probably released outside the bacterial cells as a consequence of a secretory process or cell lysis. Nevertheless, formation of elemental selenium nanoparticles under aerobic conditions by B. fungorum DBT1 and B. fungorum 95 is likely due to intracellular reduction mechanisms. Biomedical and other high tech sectors might exploit these biogenic nanoparticles in the near future, once fully characterized and tested for their multiple properties.",

Carbon catabolite repression was avoided by maintaining glucose concentration below 10 g/L. Xylose concentrations above 30 g/L were inhibitory for growth and production. In fed-batch cultivations, pulse size and feed addition rate were controlled in order to reach high productivities and efficient sugar consumptions. High xylose uptake and P(3HB) productivity were attained with glucose-rich mixtures (glucose/xylose ratio in the feed = 1.5 w/w) using high feeding rates, while with xylose-richer feeds (glucose/xylose = 0.8 w/w), a lower feeding rate is a robust strategy to avoid xylose build-up in the medium. Xylitol production was observed with xylose concentrations in the medium above 30–40 g/L. With sugar mixtures featuring even lower glucose/xylose ratios, i.e. xylose-richer feeds (glucose/xylose = 0.5), xylonic acid (a second byproduct) was produced. This is the first report of the ability of Burkholderia sacchari to produce both xylitol and xylonic acid.",

Hence, we investigated the response of P. polymyxa to high 2,3-BD concentrations. In fed-batch cultures (6-L bioreactor) 2,3-BD was accumulated to a maximum concentration of 47 g/L despite the presence of residual 13 g/L glucose in the medium. Concomitantly, accumulation of acetoin, the precursor of 2,3-BD increased after maximum 2,3-BD concentration was reached, suggesting that 2,3-BD was reconverted to acetoin after the concentration tolerance threshold of 2,3-BD was exceeded. Cultures of P. polymyxa were then challenged with levo-2,3-BD (20, 40 and 60 g/L) at 0 h in a glucose medium, and a concentration dependent growth inhibition response to levo-2,3-BD was observed. The growth of P. polymyxa was completely inhibited by 60 g/L levo-2,3-BD. Furthermore, P. polymyxa was challenged with incremental 2,3-BD concentrations (20, 40 and 60 g/L at 12, 24 and 36 h, respectively) to mimic 2,3-BD accumulation during fermentation. Interestingly, 2,3-BD was reconverted to acetoin when its concentration reached 60 g/L, possibly to alleviate 2,3-BD toxicity. Collectively, our findings indicate that 2,3-BD-mediated toxicity is a major metabolic impediment to 2,3-BD overproduction, thus, making it an important metabolic engineering target towards rational design of a 2,3-BD-overproducing strain.",

Yet, there is still uncertainty about wider implications of this technology for rural development, including effects for landless rural laborers. Bt-related yield advantages may lead to intensified production and higher demand for labor. Building on farm survey data collected in Pakistan and using double-hurdle regression models, we analyze employment effects of Bt cotton adoption. Model estimates show that Bt adoption has increased the demand for hired labor by 55%. Manual harvesting, which is common in Pakistan, is a labor-intensive activity primarily carried out by female laborers. Accordingly, gender disaggregation shows that the employment-generating effects are particularly strong for women, who often belong to the most disadvantaged groups of rural societies. These results suggest that Bt technology can contribute to additional employment income for the poor and to more equitable rural development.",

Selected nutritional and operational parameters were evaluated to identify strategies that favour the production of each metabolite. From those experiments, it was possible to isolate cells able to produce 22% more butanol than the parent strain in serum bottles. The supplementation of the culture medium with 2 mg l−1 of iron increased the production of butanol by 163%, and the optimum inoculum age was found to be 12 hours. Overall, the experiments conducted in bioreactor led to lower butanol titers than in serum bottles, which is attributed to the higher pressure present in the bottles. At pH 6.0, N2 sparging notoriously favoured the production of biomass and 1,3-PDO, while a lower pH (5.0) led to a higher butanol yield, although growth was negatively affected. The results herein gathered allowed the identification of specific conditions that favour the production of either butanol or 1,3-PDO.

Whereas functionalization with antibodies is generally well established, immobilization of DNA probes, such as aptamers, is not yet fully explored. In this work, four different types of commercially available magnetic particles, coated with streptavidin, maleimide or carboxyl groups, were evaluated for their surface coverage with aptamer bioreceptors, efficiency in capturing target protein and non-specific protein adsorption on their surface. A recently developed aptamer against the peanut allergen, Ara h 1 protein, was used as a model system. Conjugation of biotinylated Ara h 1 aptamer to the streptavidin particles led to the highest surface coverage, whereas the coverage of maleimide particles was 25% lower. Carboxylated particles appeared to be inadequate for DNA functionalization. Streptavidin particles also showed the greatest target capturing efficiency, comparable to the one of particles functionalized with anti-Ara h 1 antibody. The performance of streptavidin particles was additionally tested in a sandwich assay with the aptamer as a capture receptor on the particle surface. While the limit of detection obtained was comparable to the same assay system with antibody as capture receptor, it was superior to previously reported values using the same aptamer in similar assay schemes with different detection platforms. These results point to the promising application of the Ara h 1 aptamer-functionalized particles in bioassay development.",

     "abstract": "Cancer biomarkers represent a revolutionary advance toward personalised cancer treatment, promising therapies that are tailored to subgroups of patients sharing similar generic traits. Notwithstanding the optimism driving this development, biomarkers also present an array of social and ethical questions, as witnessed in sporadic debates across different literatures. This review article seeks to consolidate these debates in a mapping of the complex terrain of ethical and social aspects of cancer biomarker research. This mapping was undertaken from the vantage point offered by a working cancer biomarker research centre called the Centre for Cancer Biomarkers (CCBIO) in Norway, according to a dialectic move between the literature and discussions with researchers and practitioners in the laboratory. Starting in the lab, we found that, with the exception of some classical bioethical dilemmas, researchers regarded many issues relative to the ethos of the biomarker community; how the complexity and uncertainty characterising biomarker research influence their scientific norms of quality. Such challenges to the ethos of cancer research remain largely implicit, outside the scope of formal bioethical enquiry, yet form the basis for other social and ethical issues. Indeed, looking out from the lab we see how questions of complexity, uncertainty and quality contribute to debates around social and global justice; undermining policies for the prioritisation of care, framing the stratification of those patients worthy of treatment, and limiting global access to this highly sophisticated research. We go on to discuss biomarker research within the culturally-constructed ‘war on cancer’ and highlight an important tension between the expectations of ‘magic bullets’ and the complexity and uncertainty faced in the lab. We conclude by arguing, with researchers in the CCBIO, for greater reflexivity and humility in cancer biomarker research and policy.",

     "abstract": "Humic acids (HAs) are macromolecules of undefined compositions that vary with origin, the process by which they are obtained and functional groups present in their structure, such as quinones, phenols, and carboxylic acids. In addition to agriculture, there is an increased interest in HAs due to their important pharmacological effects. However, HAs are not readily soluble in water at physiological pH, which may limit their bioavailability. Although primary aggregation forms non-uniform pseudo-micelles, the presence of ionisable groups in the HA molecule makes pH an environmental stimulus for controlled aggregation and precipitation. The aim of this work was to induce HA deprotonation and protonation, without compromising their colloidal dispersion, by means of pH changes as a strategy to produce nanoparticles. Deprotonation and protonation were achieved by treating HAs with sodium hydroxide and acetic acid, respectively, at various concentrations. Non pH-treated HAs at the same concentrations were used as control. The evolution of the treatments was monitored by pH changes in bulk solutions as a function of time. At equilibrium, the conformation of the colloidal structures was characterised by the predominant mean diameter, polydispersity index and absorbance of the solutions. The zeta potential was also measured in protonation assays. Moreover, the fungicidal activity of the nanoparticles was evaluated on the mycelial growth of three fungal genera. The results showed the pH decrease or increment as a function of the balance between hydroxyl and carboxyl groups and of the diffusion rate inside the structures. Deprotonation followed by protonation produced nanosized (100–200 nm), electrostatically stable (−30 mV) and pH-responsive particles with a polydispersity index <0.5. The protonated nanoparticles significantly inhibited (P ≤ 0.05) the mycelial growth of Candida albicans in vitro, when compared with control, and the fungicidal activity was dose-dependent. No activity was observed for the deprotonated HAs nanoparticles. These results show that deprotonation followed by protonation is an easy and useful strategy for the controlled production of HA nanoparticles, which exhibit a tendency to elicit fungicidal effects, with potential to develop new classes of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.",

Ten antibody clones showing different ranking in terms of frequency were reproduced from synthetic DNA constructs and their capacity to bind HDL was verified by an immunoassay.

The characterisation and optimisation of the combined steps have been carried out on strains of Stichococcus bacillaris, focusing on catalyst type and concentration, reaction time and temperature, methanol/biomass ratio, pre-mixing time and water content in the biomass. The bio-oil yield has been referenced as production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). The maximum yield (∼17%) was achieved using dried biomass with alkaline catalyst at 60 °C and methanol/biomass weight ratio of 79:1. Alkaline catalyst conditions gave faster reaction rates and higher bio-oil yields than acid catalyst. Yield was also strongly affected by water content in the biomass. A mechanistic interpretation has been proposed to elucidate the effect of the different operating conditions. However, the structural characteristics of the Chlorophyta cell wall can be very different, leading to different bio-oil yields when the same protocol is applied. Therefore, the optimised protocol of direct transesterification for Stichococcus bacillaris strains was tested on other Stichococcus strains and several other Chlorophyta species characterised by a different cell wall structure. It was clearly demonstrated that different results for bio-oil yield were obtained within the same microalgal species and much more within different microalgal genera.",

A 26−2 fractional factorial design experiment followed by a central composite design (CCD 23) was performed to optimize the culture conditions and improve the extracellular proteolytic activity. The results indicated that the presence of peptone in the medium was the most influential factor in protease production. Enzymatic activity was enhanced by the interaction between low glucose and peptone concentrations. The optimization of culture conditions with the aid of mathematical modeling enabled a c. 45% increase in proteolytic activity and at the same time reduced the amount of glucose and peptone required for the culture.

Sweet cherry is a non-climacteric fruit, for which ripening is known to be regulated by abscisic acid. Here we aimed to examine the hormone profiles, including measurements of abscisic acid, auxins, cytokinins and gibberellins by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS), in relation to variations in sugar and anthocyanin contents, during growth and ripening of this fruit. Hormonal profiling revealed that indole-3-acetic acid, GA1 and trans-zeatin levels decreased at early stages of fruit development, while GA3 levels decreased at early stages but also later, once anthocyanin accumulation started. Conversely, abscisic acid levels rose significantly once the fruit started to synthetize anthocyanins, and isopentenyladenosine levels also increased during the ripening of sweet cherries. A strong negative correlation was found between GA4 levels and both fruit biomass and anthocyanin levels, and between the levels of trans-zeatin and both fruit biomass and total sugar contents. In contrast, abscisic acid and isopentenyladenosine levels correlated positively with fruit biomass, anthocyanin and total soluble sugar content. Results suggest that auxins, cytokinins and gibberellins may act coordinately with abscisic acid in the regulation of sweet cherry development and ripening. Furthermore, it is shown that hormonal profile measurements by UHPLC–MS/MS may be a helpful tool to elucidate the timing of action of each specific hormonal compound during ripening, which has important applications in the agri-food biotechnological sector.",

In BG CP, yields were homogenous and there was no substantial difference in the variation of the CP content between primary transformants (T0), clones of T0 individuals, T1 siblings and F1 siblings of hybrids.

     "abstract": "It is not known whether diesel-degrading bacterial communities are structurally and functionally robust when exposed to different hydrocarbon types. Here, we exposed a diesel-degrading consortium to model either alkanes, cycloalkanes or aromatic hydrocarbons as carbon sources to study its structural resistance. The structural resistance was low, with changes in relative abundances of up to four orders of magnitude, depending on hydrocarbon type and bacterial taxon. This low resistance is explained by the presence of hydrocarbon-degrading specialists in the consortium and differences in growth kinetics on individual hydrocarbons. However, despite this low resistance, structural and functional resilience were high, as verified by re-exposing the hydrocarbon-perturbed consortium to diesel fuel. The high resilience is either due to the short exposure time, insufficient for permanent changes in consortium structure and function, or the ability of some consortium members to be maintained during exposure on degradation intermediates produced by other members. Thus, the consortium is expected to cope with short-term exposures to narrow carbon feeds, while maintaining its structural and functional integrity, which remains an advantage over biodegradation approaches using single species cultures.",

     "abstract": "Stratified Medicine (SM) is becoming a natural result of advances in biomedical science and a promising path for the innovation-based biopharmaceutical industry to create new investment opportunities. While the use of biomarkers to improve R&D efficiency and productivity is very much acknowledged by industry, much work remains to be done to understand the drivers and conditions that favour using a stratified approach to create economically viable products and to justify the investment in SM interventions as a stratification option.In this paper we apply a decision analytical methodology to address the economic attractiveness of different SM development options in a cost-contained healthcare environment. For this purpose, a hypothetical business case in the oncology market has been developed considering four feasible development scenarios.The article outlines the effects of development time and time to peak sales as key economic value drivers influencing profitability of SM interventions under specific conditions. If regulatory and reimbursement challenges can be solved, decreasing development time and enhancing early market penetration would most directly improve the economic attractiveness of SM interventions. Appropriate tailoring of highly differentiated patient subgroups is the prerequisite to leverage potential efficiency gains in the R&D process. Also, offering a better targeted and hence ultimately more cost-effective therapy at reimbursable prices will facilitate time to market access and allow increasing market share gains within the targeted populations.",

The majority of studies of indole action have been performed with bacteria cultured under aerobic conditions and little information is available about its effects under anaerobic conditions. Here the effect of the indole on anaerobic metabolism of Escherichia coli WDHL was studied. Indole in the range 0.5–8 mM was added to the culture medium and cell growth, hydrogen and metabolite production were compared to cultures lacking indole. Results showed that while 8 mM indole abolished growth completely, 4 mM indole had a partial bacteriostatic effect and the maximum optical density of the culture decreased by 44% compared to the control cultures. In addition, 4 mM indole had an important effect on anaerobic metabolism. Hydrogen production increased from 650 ± 115 to 1137 ± 343 mL H2/L, and hydrogen yield increased from 0.45 ± 0.1 to 0.94 ± 0.34 mol H2/mol glucose, compared to the control culture. Carbon flux was also affected and the composition of the final by-products changed. Lactate (41 mM) was the main metabolite in the control cultures, whereas ethanol (56.2 mM) and acetate (41.2 mM) were the main metabolites in the cultures with 2 mM indole. We conclude that the supplementation of E. coli cultures with exogenous indole is a simple and novel strategy to improve the production of hydrogen as well as other metabolites such as ethanol used as biofuels.",

     "abstract": "This work focuses on the performance of ten commercial Saccharomyces yeast strains in the batch alcoholic fermentation of sugars contained in selected industrial wastewaters from the soft drink industry. Fermentation has been applied successfully to treat these effluents prior to their disposal. Although many strains were investigated, similar behaviour was observed between all of the Saccharomyces strains tested. When media were inoculated with 2 g L−1 of yeast, all strains were able to completely consume the available sugars in less than 14 h. Thus, any of the strains studied in this work could be used in non-conventional wastewater treatment processes based on alcoholic fermentation. However, ethanol production varied between strains, and these differences could be significant from a production point of view. Saccharomyces bayanus produced the most ethanol, with a mean yield of 0.44 gethanol gsugarconsumed−1 and an ethanol specific production rate of 5.96 gethanol (L h)−1. As the assayed soft drinks wastewaters contain about 105 gsugar/L of fermentable sugars, the concentration of ethanol achieved after the fermentations process was 46.2 gethanol/L. A rigorous kinetic modelling methodology was used to model the Saccharomyces bayanus fermentation process. The kinetic model included coupled mass balances and a minimal number of parameters. A simple unstructured model based on the Andrews equation (substrate inhibition) was developed. This model satisfactorily described biomass growth, sugar consumption and bioethanol production. In addition to providing insights into the fermentative performance of potentially relevant strains, this work can facilitate the design of large-scale ethanol production processes that use wastewaters from the sugar-sweetened beverage industry as feedstock.",

In both species, shoot and root proliferation as well as plant biomass were generally higher when NAA was combined with the individual CK than in NAA or CK treatment. The highest concentration of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, 619 pmol g−1 DW) and 2-oxindole-3-acetic acid (OxIAA, 2381 pmol g−1 DW) were observed in EA-treated with NAA alone while mT treatment (without NAA) had the most abundant indole-3-acetyl-l-aspartic acid (IAAsp, 904 and 582 pmol g−1 DW for EA and EZ, respectively) in both species. A significant concentration of total endogenous CK accumulated in both Eucomis regenerants from mT and mT + NAA when compared to the other treatments.

     "abstract": "Mutation breeding has a long-standing history and in some major crop species, many of the most important cultivars have their origin in germplasm generated by mutation induction. For almost two decades, methods for TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) have been established in model plant species such as Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana L.), enabling the functional analysis of genes. Recent advances in mutation detection by second generation sequencing technology have brought its utility to major crop species. However, it has remained difficult to apply similar approaches in forage and turf grasses, mainly due to their outbreeding nature maintained by an efficient self-incompatibility system.Starting with a description of the extent to which traditional mutagenesis methods have contributed to crop yield increase in the past, this review focuses on technological approaches to implement TILLING-based strategies for the improvement of forage grass breeding through forward and reverse genetics. We present first results from TILLING in allogamous forage grasses for traits such as stress tolerance and evaluate prospects for rapid implementation of beneficial alleles to forage grass breeding.In conclusion, large-scale induced mutation resources, used for forward genetic screens, constitute a valuable tool to increase the genetic diversity for breeding and can be generated with relatively small investments in forage grasses. Furthermore, large libraries of sequenced mutations can be readily established, providing enhanced opportunities to discover mutations in genes controlling traits of agricultural importance and to study gene functions by reverse genetics.",

Following the elucidation of each step in their biosynthesis and the important components of perception and signaling, several activators, repressors and co-repressors have been identified which contribute to fine-tuning the regulation of JA-induced gene expression. Many of the metabolic reactions in which JA participates, such as conjugation with amino acids, glucosylation, hydroxylation, carboxylation, sulfation and methylation, lead to numerous compounds with different biological activities. These metabolites may be highly active, partially active in specific processes or inactive. Hydroxylation, carboxylation and sulfation inactivate JA signaling. The precursor of JA biosynthesis, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), has been identified as a JA-independent signaling compound. An increasing number of OPDA-specific processes is being identified.

By contrast, the scavenging of ROS by prenyllipids affects signaling pathways where ROS play a role as signaling molecules.As the primary antioxidants, isoprenoid quinones and chromanols are synthesized under high-light stress in response to any increased production of ROS. During photo-oxidative stress, these prenyllipids are continuously synthesized and oxidized to other compounds. In turn, their oxidation products (hydroxy-plastochromanol, plastoquinol-C, plastoquinone-B) can still have an antioxidant function.

Fungal conidia and sclerotia could be considered the most important structures for pathogenesis as their germination is one of the first steps towards a host infection. They represent interesting objects for proteomic studies because of the presence of unique proteins with unexplored biotechnological potential required for pathogen viability, development and the subsequent host infection.

They participate in the metabolism of polyamines or osmoprotectants. The enzymes are characterized by their broad substrate specificity covering ω-aminoaldehydes, aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes as well as nitrogen-containing heterocyclic aldehydes. The isoenzyme 1 from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum; SlAMADH1) oxidizes aliphatic aldehydes very efficiently and converts also furfural, its derivatives or benzaldehyde, which are present at low concentrations in alcoholic distillates such as fruit brandy. In this work, SlAMADH1 was examined as a bioanalytical tool for their detection. These aldehydes arise from fermentation processes or thermal degradation of sugars and their presence is related to health complications after consumption including nausea, emesis, sweating, decrease in blood pressure, hangover headache, among others. Sixteen samples of slivovitz (plum brandy) from local producers in Moravia, Czech Republic, were analyzed for their aldehyde content using a spectrophotometric activity assay with SlAMADH1. In all cases, there were oxidative responses observed when monitoring NADH production in the enzymatic reaction. Aldehydes in the distillate samples were also subjected to a standard determination using reversed-phase HPLC with spectrophotometric and tandem mass spectrometric detection after a derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. Results obtained by both methods were found to correlate well for a majority of the analyzed samples.

     "abstract": "Cytokinin plant hormones have been shown to play an important role in plant response to abiotic stresses. Herein, we expand upon the findings of Pospíšilová et al. [30] regarding preparation of novel transgenic barley lines overexpressing cytokinin dehydrogenase 1 gene from Arabidopsis under the control of mild root-specific promotor of maize β-glycosidase. These lines showed drought-tolerant phenotype mainly due to alteration of root architecture and stronger lignification of root tissue. A detailed transcriptomic analysis of roots of transgenic plants subjected to revitalization after drought stress revealed attenuated response through the HvHK3 cytokinin receptor and up-regulation of two transcription factors implicated in stress responses and abscisic acid sensitivity. Increased expression of several genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway as well as of genes encoding arogenate dehydratase/lyase participating in phenylalanine synthesis was found in roots during revitalization. Although more precursors of lignin synthesis were present in roots after drought stress, final lignin accumulation did not change compared to that in plants grown under optimal conditions. Changes in transcriptome indicated a higher auxin turnover in transgenic roots. The same analysis in leaves revealed that genes encoding putative enzymes responsible for production of jasmonates and other volatile compounds were up-regulated. Although transgenic barley leaves showed lower chlorophyll content and down-regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in photosynthesis than did wild-type plants when cultivated under optimal conditions, they did show a tendency to return to initial photochemical activities faster than did wild-type leaves when re-watered after severe drought stress. In contrast to optimal conditions, comparative transcriptomic analysis of revitalized leaves displayed up-regulation of genes encoding enzymes and proteins involved in photosynthesis, and especially those encoded by the chloroplast genome. Taken together, our results indicate that the partial cytokinin insensitivity induced in barley overexpressing cytokinin dehydrogenase contributes to tolerance to drought stress.",

The barley (Hordeum vulgare) cultivar Golden Promise was transformed using the cytokinin dehydrogenase 1 gene from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtCKX1) under the control of mild root-specific β-glucosidase promoter from maize. Increased cytokinin degradation activity was observed positively to affect the number and length of lateral roots. The impact on morphology depended upon the recombinant protein's subcellular compartmentation. While assumed cytosolic and vacuolar targeting of AtCKX1 had negligible effect on shoot growth, secretion of AtCKX1 protein to the apoplast had a negative effect on development of the aerial part and yield. Upon the application of severe drought stress, all transgenic genotypes maintained higher water content and showed better growth and yield parameters during revitalization. Higher tolerance to drought stress was most caused by altered root morphology resulting in better dehydration avoidance.",

The pathogenicity of R. fascians strain D188 is known to be encoded by the linear plasmid pFiD188 and to be dictated by its capacity to produce a mixture of cytokinins. Here, we show that D188-5, the nonpathogenic plasmid-free derivative of the wild-type strain D188 actually has a plant growth-promoting effect. With the availability of the genome sequence of R. fascians, the chromosome of strain D188 was mined for putative plant growth-promoting functions and the functionality of some of these activities was tested. This analysis together with previous results suggests that the plant growth-promoting activity of R. fascians is due to production of plant growth modulators, such as auxin and cytokinin, combined with degradation of ethylene through 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase. Moreover, R. fascians has several functions that could contribute to efficient colonization and competitiveness, but there is little evidence for a strong impact on plant nutrition.

     "abstract": "Flowering time variation was identified within a mapping population of doubled haploid lines developed from a cross between the introgressive line 8.1 and spring bread wheat cv. Tähti. The line 8.1 carried introgressions from tetraploid Triticum militinae in the cv. Tähti genetic background on chromosomes 1A, 2A, 4A, 5A, 7A, 1B and 5B. The most significant QTL for the flowering time variation was identified within the introgressed region on chromosome 5A and its largest effect was associated with the VRN-A1 locus, accounting for up to 70% of phenotypic variance. The allele of T. militinae origin was designated as VRN-A1f-like. The effect of the VRN-A1f-like allele was verified in two other mapping populations. QTL analysis identified that in cv. Tähti and cv. Mooni genetic background, VRN-A1f-like allele incurred a delay of 1.9–18.6 days in flowering time, depending on growing conditions. Sequence comparison of the VRN-A1f-like and VRN-A1a alleles from the parental lines of the mapping populations revealed major mutations in the promoter region as well as in the first intron, including insertion of a MITE element and a large deletion. The sequence variation allowed construction of specific diagnostic PCR markers for VRN-A1f-like allele determination. Identification and quantification of the effect of the VRN-A1f-like allele offers a useful tool for wheat breeding and for studying fine-scale regulation of flowering pathways in wheat.",

In vitro manipulations of flax are used for genetic improvement and breeding while improvements in adventitious root formation are important for biotechnological programs focused on regeneration and vegetative propagation of genetically valuable plant material. Additionally, flax hypocotyl segments possess outstanding morphogenetic capacity, thus providing a useful model for the investigation of flax developmental processes.Here, we investigated the crosstalk between hydrogen peroxide and auxin with respect to reprogramming flax hypocotyl cells for root morphogenetic development. Exogenous auxin induced the robust formation of adventitious roots from flax hypocotyl segments while the addition of hydrogen peroxide further enhanced this process. The levels of endogenous auxin (indole-3-acetic acid; IAA) were positively correlated with increased root formation in response to exogenous auxin (1-Naphthaleneacetic acid; NAA). Histochemical staining of the hypocotyl segments revealed that hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase, but not superoxide, were positively correlated with root formation. Measurements of antioxidant enzyme activities showed that endogenous levels of hydrogen peroxide were controlled by peroxidases during root formation from hypocotyl segments.In conclusion, hydrogen peroxide positively affected flax adventitious root formation by regulating the endogenous auxin levels. Consequently, this agent can be applied to increase flax regeneration capacity for biotechnological purposes such as improved plant rooting.",

The fungus attacks unfertilized ovaries of grasses and forms sclerotia, which represent the only type of tissue where the synthesis of EAs occurs. The biosynthetic pathway of EAs has been extensively studied; however, little is known concerning its regulation. Here, we present the quantitative transcriptome analysis of the sclerotial and mycelial tissues providing a comprehensive view of transcriptional differences between the tissues that produce EAs and those that do not produce EAs and the pathogenic and non-pathogenic lifestyle. The results indicate metabolic changes coupled with sclerotial differentiation, which are likely needed as initiation factors for EA biosynthesis. One of the promising factors seems to be oxidative stress. Here, we focus on the identification of putative transcription factors and regulators involved in sclerotial differentiation, which might be involved in EA biosynthesis. To shed more light on the regulation of EA composition, whole transcriptome analysis of four industrial strains differing in their alkaloid spectra was performed. The results support the hypothesis proposing the composition of the amino acid pool in sclerotia to be an important factor regulating the final structure of the ergopeptines produced by Claviceps purpurea.",

Second, methods were developed to allow multiplexed enrichment and quantification of peptide surrogates of protein biomarkers representing a very broad range of concentrations and widely different molecular masses in human plasma. The total workflow coefficients of variation (including the 3 sequential steps of digestion, SISCAPA peptide enrichment and mass spectrometric analysis) for 5 proteotypic peptides measured in 6 replicates of each of 6 different samples repeated over 6 days averaged 3.4% within-run and 4.3% across all runs. An experiment to identify sources of variation in the workflow demonstrated that MRM measurement and tryptic digestion steps each had average CVs of ∼2.7%. Because of the high purity of the peptide analytes enriched by antibody capture, the liquid chromatography step is minimized and in some cases eliminated altogether, enabling throughput levels consistent with requirements of large biomarker and clinical studies.",

The Global Proteome Survey or GPS is a method that combines mass spectrometry and affinity enrichment with the use of antibodies. The technology enables profiling of complex proteomes in a species independent manner. The sensitivity of GPS, and other methods relying on affinity enrichment, is largely affected by the activity of the exploited affinity reagent. We here present an improvement of the GPS platform by utilizing an antibody immobilization approach which ensures a controlled immobilization process of the antibody to the magnetic bead support. More specifically, we make use of an antibody format that enables site-directed biotinylation and use this in combination with streptavidin coated magnetic beads. The performance of the expanded GPS platform was evaluated by profiling yeast proteome samples. We demonstrate that the oriented antibody immobilization strategy increases the ability of the GPS platform and results in larger fraction of functional antibodies.

Thus for any specific biological problem, both efficient and at the same time mild, protocols for cell separation, together with tissue specific panels of antibodies, need to be developed and optimized. Here we characterize an antibody panel that permits the discrimination of mononuclear muscle cell populations by mass cytometry and use it to characterize the cell populations obtained by three different cell extraction procedures from muscle fibers.

Mutations of SHP-2 are known to affect the activation of the RAS pathway. Gain-of-function mutations cause the Noonan syndrome, the most common non-chromosomal congenital disorder. In order to obtain a holistic picture of the intricate regulatory mechanisms underlying SHP-2 physiology and pathology, we set out to characterize perturbations of the cell phosphorylation profile caused by an altered localization of SHP-2. To describe the proteins whose activity may be directly or indirectly modulated by SHP-2 activity, we identified tyrosine peptides that are differentially phosphorylated in wild type SHP-2 cells and isogenic cells expressing a non-functional SHP-2 variant that cannot dephosphorylate the physiological substrates due to a defect in cellular localization upon growth factor stimulation. By an iTRAQ based strategy coupled to mass spectrometry, we have identified 63 phosphorylated tyrosine residues in 53 different proteins whose phosphorylation is affected by SHP-2 activity. Some of these confirm already established regulatory mechanisms while many others suggest new possible signaling routes that may contribute to the modulation of the ERK and p38 pathways by SHP-2. Interestingly many new proteins that we found to be regulated by SHP-2 activity are implicated in the formation and regulation of focal adhesions.",

While monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies have been shown to be useful in assessing the phosphoproteome, we have expanded our efforts to exploit the Forkhead-associated 1 (FHA1) domain as scaffold for generating recombinant affinity reagents that recognize phosphothreonine-containing peptides. A phage display library of FHA1 variants was screened by affinity selection with 15 phosphothreonine-containing peptides corresponding to various human transcription factors and kinases, including human Myc, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and extracellular-signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). The library yielded binding variants against 10 targets (66% success rate); success was largely determined by what residue occurred at the +3 position (C-terminal) to the pThr moiety (i.e., pT+3). The FHA domains binding Myc, CaMKII, and ERK1/2 were characterized and compared against commercially available antibodies. All FHA domains were shown to be phosphorylation-dependent and phosphothreonine-specific in their binding, unlike several commercial monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Both the pThr and the residue at the pT+3 position were major factors in defining the specificity of the FHA domains.",

Due to their robustness and ease of handling, immunoassays are favourite methods for investigation of various biological or medical questions. Nevertheless in many cases, additional analyses such as mass spectrometry are used to validate or confirm the results of immunoassays. To minimize the workload and to increase confidence in immunoassays, there are urgent needs for antibodies which are both highly specific and well validated. Unfortunately many commercially available antibodies are neither well characterized nor fully tested for cross-reactivities. Adequate quality control and validation of an antibody is time-consuming and can be frustrating. Such validation needs to be performed for every assay/application. However, where an antibody validation is successful, a highly specific and stable reagent will be on hand. This article describes the validation processes of antibodies, including some often neglected factors, as well as unspecific binding to other sample compounds in a multiparameter diagnostic assay. The validation consists of different immunological methods, with important assay controls, and is performed in relation to the development of a diagnostic test.",

As in other fields, neuroscientists are frequently confronted with inaccurate and irreproducible Ab-based results and/or reporting. The UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility was created with the mission of addressing the unmet need for high-quality Abs in neuroscience research by applying a unique approach to generate and validate mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) optimized for use against mammalian brain (i.e., NeuroMabs). Here we describe our methodology of multi-step mAb screening focused on identifying mAbs exhibiting efficacy and specificity in labeling mammalian brain samples. We provide examples from NeuroMab screens, and from the subsequent specialized validation of those selected as NeuroMabs. We highlight the particular challenges and considerations of determining specificity for brain immunolabeling. We also describe why our emphasis on extensive validation of large numbers of candidates by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry against brain samples is essential for identifying those that exhibit efficacy and specificity in those applications to become NeuroMabs. We describe the special attention given to candidates with less common non-IgG1 IgG subclasses that can facilitate simultaneous multiplex labeling with subclass-specific secondary antibodies. We detail our recent use of recombinant cloning of NeuroMabs as a method to archive all NeuroMabs, to unambiguously define NeuroMabs at the DNA sequence level, and to re-engineer IgG1 NeuroMabs to less common IgG subclasses to facilitate their use in multiplex labeling. Finally, we provide suggestions to facilitate Ab development and use, as to design, execution and interpretation of Ab-based neuroscience experiments. Reproducibility in neuroscience research will improve with enhanced Ab validation, unambiguous identification of Abs used in published experiments, and end user proficiency in Ab-based assays.",

In a pilot scheme, a library of 456 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) binders to 134 antigens was used. They were arranged in a microarray format and incubated with the protein content of clinical tissue samples isolated from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and healthy pancreas, as well as recurrent and non-recurrent bladder tumours. We observed significant variation in the expression of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (CHFR) as well as the glutamate receptor interacting protein 2 (GRIP2), for example, always with more than one of the scFvs binding to these targets. Only the relevant antibodies were then characterised further on antigen microarrays and by surface plasmon resonance experiments so as to select the most specific and highest affinity antibodies.

Firstly, sample extraction, indispensable because of the presence of mycelia, can bring into the extract components with a similar structure to that of the analyte of interest; secondly, mycelia can influence the recovery of the analyte. We prepared calibration standards of 3-phenoxy-1,2-propanediol (PPD) in the pure solvent and in the presence of mycelia (spiked before or after extraction) from five fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus tubingensis, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, Penicillium sp. and Aspergillus terreus). The quantification of PPD was carried out by HPLC–UV and UV–vis spectrophotometry. The manuscript shows that the last method is as accurate as the HPLC method. However, the colorimetric method led to a higher data throughput, which allowed the study of more samples in a shorter time. Matrix effects were evaluated visually from the plotted calibration data and statistically by simultaneously comparing the intercept and slope of calibration curves performed with solvent, post-extraction spiked standards and pre-extraction spiked standards. Significant differences were found between the post- and pre-extraction spiked matrix-matched functions. Pre-extraction spiked matrix-matched functions based on A. tubingensis mycelia, selected as the reference, were validated and used to compensate for low recoveries. These validated functions were successfully applied to the quantification of PPD achieved during the hydrolysis of glycidyl phenyl ether by mycelium-bound epoxide hydrolases and equivalent hydrolysis yields were determined by HPLC–UV and UV–vis spectrophotometry. This study may serve as starting point to implement matrix effects evaluation when mycelium-bound epoxide hydrolases are studied.",

However, the molecular mechanisms governing the synergistic effects between catalytic domains and their CBMs are not fully understood. Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate the functional effects of the fusion of a CBM belonging to family 6, which exhibits high affinity to xylan, with the GH11 xylanase from Bacillus subtilis, which does not have a CBM in its wild-type form. The wild-type enzyme (BsXyl11) and the chimeric protein (BsXyl11-CBM6) were heterologously produced in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity for biochemical characterization. The molecular fusion did not alter the pH and temperature dependence, but kinetic data revealed an increase of 65% in the catalytic efficiency of the chimeric enzyme. Furthermore, the BsXyl11-CBM6 chimera was used to supplement the commercial cocktail Accellerase® 1500 and improved the reducing sugar release by 17% from pretreated sugarcane bagasse.

An attractive candidate is cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS), a cell-lysate-based in vitro expression system, which can utilize linear DNA as expression templates, bypassing time-consuming cloning steps of plasmid-based methods. Traditionally, such linear DNA expression templates (LET) have been vulnerable to degradation by nucleases present in the cell lysate, leading to lower yields. This challenge has been significantly addressed in the recent past, propelling LET-based CFPS as a useful tool for studying, screening and engineering proteins in a high-throughput manner. Currently, LET-based CFPS has promise in fields such as functional proteomics, protein microarrays, and the optimization of complex biological systems.",

     "abstract": "High activity and stability are essential for (hemi)cellulolytic enzymes used in biomass conversion, while non-productive binding of cellulases to lignin reduces saccharification efficiency and needs to be avoided. One potential strategy is the addition of inexpensive metal ions. This paper describes the influence of divalent metal ions on the activity, thermostability, and saccharification efficiency of (hemi)cellulolytic enzymes produced in-house by Aspergillus niger under solid-state fermentation (SSF). The use of Mn2+ provided the best (hemi)cellulolytic activity and stability, with an increase in endoglucanase activity of up to 57%. The use of Mn2+ was then investigated in the saccharification of sugarcane bagasse submitted to acid, steam-explosion, and hydrothermal pretreatments. The addition of Mn2+ ions at 10 mM in the saccharification of acid-pretreated bagasse resulted in a 34% increase in glucose release. These positive effects appeared to be due to a reduction in non-productive enzyme adsorption. The findings suggest that the addition of inexpensive metal ions can help to improve activity, thermostability, and saccharification efficiency of (hemi)cellulolytic enzymes.",

Polyphenolic compounds of wet (WP) and dried (DP) red pomace were recovered by enzymatic digestions and ethanol-based extractions. Fungamyl and Celluclast enzymes were found to be the most effective in enhancing polyphenol release from WP. WP samples showed the highest capacity of releasing polyphenols with 2 h control 24°C and 2 h 1% Celluclast resulting as the best treatments. A significantly lower amount of polyphenols was recovered from DP most probably as a consequence of the pomace drying. The best extracts contained high amounts of total polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins and anthocyanins and exerted antioxidant and cholesterol-lowering activities. The results support the possibility of exploiting the extracts coming from grape processing by-products as ingredients for functional and innovative products in the nutraceutical, pharmaceutical or cosmetic fields.",

     "abstract": "Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is one of the most devastating plant diseases, and poses a significant agricultural concern because of the lack of an efficient control method. Eugenol is a plant-derived natural compound that has been widely used as a food additive and in medicine. In the present study, we demonstrated the potential of eugenol to enhance the resistance of tomato plants to TYLCV. The anti-TYLCV efficiency of eugenol was significantly higher than that of moroxydine hydrochloride (MH), a widely used commercial antiviral agent. Eugenol application stimulated the production of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) and salicylic acid (SA) in tomato plants. The full-length cDNA of SlPer1, which has been suggested to be a host R gene specific to TYLCV, was isolated from tomato plants. A sequence analysis suggested that SlPer1 might be a nucleobase-ascorbate transporter (NAT) belonging to the permease family. The transcript levels of SlPer1 increased markedly in response to treatment with eugenol or TYLCV inoculation. The results of this study also showed that SlPer1 expression was strongly induced by SA, MeJA (jasmonic acid methyl ester), and NO. Thus, we propose that the increased transcription of SlPer1 contributed to the high anti-TYLCV efficiency of eugenol, which might involve in the generation of endogenous SA and NO. Such findings provide the basis for the development of eugenol as an environmental-friendly agricultural antiviral agent.",

     "abstract": "Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) designate a unique family of bioactive lactose-based molecules present in human breast milk. Using lactose as a cheap donor, some β-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23) can catalyze transgalactosylation to form the human milk oligosaccharide lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT; Gal-β(1,4)-GlcNAc-β(1,3)-Gal-β(1,4)-Glc). In order to reduce reaction times and be able to work at temperatures, which are less welcoming to microbial growth, the current study investigates the possibility of using thermostable β-galactosidases for synthesis of LNnT and N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc; Gal-β(1,4)-GlcNAc), the latter being a core structure in HMOs. Two hyperthermostable GH 1 β-galactosidases, Ttβ-gly from Thermus thermophilus HB27 and CelB from Pyrococcus furiosus, were codon-optimized for expression in Escherichia coli along with BgaD-D, a truncated version of the GH 42 β-galactosidase from Bacillus circulans showing high transgalactosylation activity at low substrate concentrations. The three β-galactosidases were compared in the current study in terms of their transgalactosylation activity in the formation of LacNAc and LNnT. In all cases, BgaD-D was the most potent transgalactosidase, but both thermostable GH 1 β-galactosidases could catalyze formation of LNnT and LacNAc, with Ttβ-gly giving higher yields than CelB. The thermal stability of the three β-galactosidases was elucidated and the results were used to optimize the reaction efficiency in the formation of LacNAc, resulting in 5–6 times higher reaction yields and significantly shorter reaction times.",

     "abstract": "The enzymatic hydrolysis (EH) rate normally decreases during the hydrolysis, leaving unhydrolyzed material as residue. This phenomenon occurs during the hydrolysis of both cellulose (avicel) and lignocellulosic material, in nature or even pretreated. The progression of EH of steam pretreated sugarcane bagasse was associated with an initial (fast), intermediate (slower) and recalcitrant (slowest) phases, at glucan to glucose conversion yields of 61.7, 81.6 and 86%, respectively. Even though the EH of avicel as a simpler material than steam pretreated sugarcane bagasse, EH slowdown was present. The less thermo-stable endo-xylanase lost 58% of initial enzyme activity, followed by β-glucosidase that lost 16%, culminating in FPase activity loss of 30% in the first 24 hours. After 72 hours of EH the total loss of FPase activity was 40% compared to the initial activity. Analysis of the solid residue from EH showed that lignin content, phenolic compounds and ash increased while glucan decreased as hydrolysis progressed. During the initial fast phase of EH, the total solid residue surface area consisted predominantly of internal surface area. Thereafter, in the intermediate and recalcitrant phases of EH, the ratio of external:internal surface area increased. The proposed fiber damage and decrease in internal surface area, probably by EH action, was visualized by scanning electron microscopy imagery. The higher lignin/glucan ratio as EH progressed and enzyme deactivation by thermo instability were the main effects observed, respectively to substrate and enzyme.",

To enhance the limited overexpression capability of natural promoters, various strategies for promoter engineering have been developed and used to construct gene expression systems in B. subtilis and other hosts. By applying a semi-rational approach for promoter engineering, a series of expression plasmids containing single and dual promoters were constructed using aminopeptidase (AP) with an intrinsic signal peptide as the reporter protein. Of the single and dual promoters investigated, the dual promoter PgsiB–PHpaII gave the best performance. To optimize secretion efficiency, the signal peptide YncM was selected after screening a library containing 19 different Sec-type signal peptides. The AP activity detected in the supernatants of a recombinant strain containing the plasmid pBSG24-YncM was as high as 88.86 U/mL. The capacity of the expression plasmid pBSG24-YncM was also evaluated with batch fermentation in a 5-L fermentor. Increased production of AP (205 U/mL, equal to 1.7 g/L) was achieved after 45 h of fermentation.

Both quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and NanoString methods were employed to look at expression of genes related to fat and glucose metabolism and this paper compares results from both methods. We conclude that NanoString offers a valuable alternative to qPCR and our data suggest that results are more accurate because of the reduced sample handling and direct quantification of gene copy number without the need for enzymatic amplification. However, we have highlighted a potential challenge for both methods, which needs to be addressed when designing primers or probes.

In order to avoid the bias generated by different assay methodologies, in this work we investigated the main properties of ten laccases from fungi and bacteria under identical conditions. As a general rule, the optimal activity was apparent at pH 3–4 and was lost at pH ≥ 7.0 (all laccases were stable at pH ≥ 7.0); enzymes active at neutral pH values were also identified. For all tested laccases, activity increased with temperature up to 80°C and stability was good at 25°C. Interestingly, laccases insensitive to high salt concentration were identified, this favoring their use in treating waste waters. Indeed, bacterial laccases retained a significant activity in the presence of DMSO (up to 40% final concentration) and of surfactants, suggesting that they can be applied in lignin degradation processes requiring solvents. The available laccases are versatile and satisfy requirements related to different processes. Notably, the recombinant laccase from Bacillus licheniformis favorably compares with the tested enzymes, indicating that it is well suited for different biotechnological applications.",

The bioreactors were operated at inlet loads (ILs) of 130 and 195 g m−3 hour−1 and at an empty bed residence time (EBRT) of 12.5 s. Under an IL of ∼130 g m−3 hour−1, BTF1 presented higher elimination capacities (ECs) than BTF2, with average values of 106 ± 7 and 68 ± 8 g m−3 hour−1, respectively. However, differences in ECs between BTFs were decreased by reducing the irrigation intervals from 1 min every 12 min to 1 min every 2 hours in BTF2. Average values of EC were 111 ± 25 and 90 ± 7 g m−3 hour−1 for BTF1 and BTF2, respectively, when working at an IL of ∼195 g m−3 hour−1. Microbial analysis revealed a significant shift in the microbial community of BTF1 inoculated with Pseudomonas sp. BOE200. At the end of the experiment, the species Microbacterium sp., Chryseobacterium sp., Acinetobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Mycobacterium sp. were detected. In BTF2 inoculated with activated sludge, the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique showed a diverse microbial community including species that was able to use 2-butoxyethanol as its carbon source, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida as representative species. Although BTF1 inoculated with Pseudomonas sp.

A brown seaweed Ecklonia maxima is widely used commercially as a biostimulant to improve plant growth and crop protection. Eckol, a phenolic compound isolated from E. maxima has recently shown stimulatory effects in maize, indicating its potential use as a plant biostimulant. Cabbage is a widely cultivated vegetable crop throughout the world, which requires high input of fertilizers and is susceptible to several aphid borne diseases. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of foliar application of eckol on the growth, phytochemical constituents and myrosinase activity (aphid resistance capacity) of commercially cultivated cabbage. Foliar application of eckol (10−6 M) significantly enhanced shoot and root length, shoot and root fresh and dry weight, leaf area and leaf number. This treatment also showed a significant increase in photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll ‘a’, chlorophyll ‘b’, total chlorophyll and carotenoid) compared to the untreated plants. The levels of protein, proline and iridoid glycosides were significantly higher in cabbage leaves with eckol treatment. All the control plants were severely infested with cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae) but no infestation was observed on the eckol-sprayed plants, which can be attributed to an increase in myrosinase activity. This study reveals dual effects (plant growth promoting and insect repelling) of eckol on cabbage plants that need further investigations both under field conditions and in other brassicaceous species.",

Model substrates were systematically designed with variations of the chain length of the alcohol and the acid as well as with varying content of the aromatic constituent terephthalic acid (Ta).HPLC/MS identification and quantification of the hydrolysis products terephthalic acid (Ta), benzoic acid (Ba), adipic acid (Ada), mono(4-hydroxybutyl) terephthalate (BTa), mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (ETa), mono-(6-hydroxyhexyl) terephthalate (HTa) and bis(4-hydroxybutyl) terephthalate (BTaB) indicated that these enzymes indeed hydrolyze the tested esters. Shorter terminal chain length acids but longer chain length alcohols in oligomeric model substrates were generally hydrolyzed more efficiently. Thc_Cut1 hydrolyzed aromatic ester bonds more efficiently than HiC resulting in up to 3-fold higher concentrations of the monomeric hydrolysis product Ta. Nevertheless, HiC exhibited a higher overall hydrolytic activity on the tested polyesters, resulting in 2-fold higher concentration of released molecules. Thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) of the polymeric model substrates revealed a general trend that a lower difference between melting temperature (Tm) and the temperature at which the enzymatic degradation takes place resulted in higher susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis.",

One is a horizontal fixed bed reactor; plug-flow operated (PF-PBC) with severe limitation of oxygen. In this reactor, the air was supplied to an equalizer reservoir at the start of the PF-PBC reactor.

This study investigated the effects of yeast extract, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (Na2EDTA), and acetic acid on 2,3-BD production from xylose. The central composite design approach was used to optimize the concentrations of these components. It was found that simultaneous addition of yeast extract, Na2EDTA, and acetic acid could significantly improve 2,3-BD production.

Furthermore, the 2,3-BD yield was 0.475 g/g, 95.0% of the theoretical maximum value.

In order to facilitate NPs adhesion on human dental surfaces, two different strategies were employed: PLGA particles with an external shell of CS to produce a positive surface charge allowing CHX loaded PLGA NPs to interact with the negative charged dental surfaces, while CS particles were functionalized with peptidomimetic derivative glutathione (GSH). The morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. A sustained release profile of CHX from CS NPs was achieved. CS-based NPs adhered on human tooth surfaces in a simulated brushing and rinsing process and their in vitro toxicity evaluation on Human Gingival Fibroblasts (HGFs) was between 20 and 60% in all experimental conditions. Thanks to their adhesion properties and low cytotoxicity, the synthesized CS-based formulations may be efficiently exploited for therapy purposes or to enhance in vivo dental care (i.e. preparation of toothpastes or other cosmetics for daily oral care).",

     "abstract": "Biofertilization with plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria is a potential alternative to plant productivity. Here, in vitro propagation of Handroanthus ochraceus (yellow lapacho), a forest crop with high economic and environmental value, was developed using the Azospirillum brasilense strains Cd and Az39 during rhizogenesis. Epicotiles of in vitro plantlets were multiplied in Woody Plant Medium (WPM). For rooting, elongated shoots were transferred to auxin-free Murashige–Skoog medium with Gamborg's vitamins and WPM, both at half salt concentration (½MSG and ½WPM), and inoculated with Cd or Az39 at the base of each shoot. Anatomical studies were performed using leaves cleared and stained with safranin for optical microscopy and leaves and roots metalized with gold–palladium for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In ½WPM auxin-free medium, A. brasilense Cd inoculation produced 55% of rooting, increased root fresh and dry weight (45% and 77%, respectively), and led to lower stomata size and density with similar proportion of open and closed stomata. Both strains selectively increased the size or density of glandular trichomes in ½MSG. Moreover, bacteria were detected on the root surface by SEM. In conclusion, the difference in H. ochraceus response to A. brasilense inoculation depends on the strain and the plant culture media. Cd strain enhanced rooting in auxin-free ½WPM and produced plantlets with features similar to those expected in ex vitro plants. This work presents an innovative in vitro approach using beneficial plant–microorganism interaction as an ecologically compatible strategy in plant biotechnology.",

     "abstract": "Rhamnogalacturonan I (RGI) modifying enzymes catalyse the degradation of the RGI backbone and encompass enzymes specific for either the α1,2-bond linking galacturonic acid to rhamnose or the α1,4-bond linking rhamnose to galacturonic acid in the RGI backbone. The first microbial enzyme found to be able to catalyse the degradation of the RGI backbone, an endo-hydrolase (EC 3.2.1.171) derived from Aspergillus aculeatus, was discovered 25 years ago. Today the group of RGI modifying enzymes encompasses endo- and exo-hydrolases as well as lyases. The RGI hydrolases, EC 3.2.1.171–EC 3.2.1.174, have been described to be produced by Aspergillus spp. and Bacillus subtilis and are categorized in glycosyl hydrolase families 28 and 105. The RGI lyases, EC 4.2.2.23–EC 4.2.2.24, have been isolated from different fungi and bacterial species and are categorized in polysaccharide lyase families 4 and 11. This review brings together the available knowledge of the RGI modifying enzymes and provides a detailed overview of biocatalytic reaction characteristics, classification, structure-function traits, and analyses the protein properties of these enzymes by multiple sequence alignments in neighbour-joining phylogenetic trees. Some recently detected unique structural features and dependence of calcium for activity of some of these enzymes (notably the lyases) are discussed and newly published results regarding improvement of their thermostability by protein engineering are highlighted. Knowledge of these enzymes is important for understanding microbial plant cell wall degradation and for advancing enzymatic processing and biorefining of pectinaceous plant biomass.",

The mycelial growth of P. variotii and T. virens exhibited a reduction of 10 and 30%, respectively, after the conidia were pre-treated with charcoal polymers, and in particular, no mycelial growth was found in C. globosum during 5 days of culture. The adsorption of Ca2+ into charcoal was suggested to inhibit growth due to the reduction in the flux of calcium ions (Ca2+) into the hyphae. In 5 h, about 15 mM of Ca2+ were removed from CaCl2 solution with 0.2 g/mL of polymers, and the nano-sized pores of the charcoals on the polymer were responsible for the Ca2+ adsorption.",

This community was dominated by the genera Flavisolibacter and Zoogloea as well as an unidentified organism belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes. The population was observed to cycle through an increase in Zoogloea followed by a return to a community composition similar to the initial one (highly enriched in Flavisolibacter). It was found that the PHA accumulation capacity of the community was robust to population flux during enrichment and even PHA accumulation, with final polymer composition dependent on the overall proportion of acetic to propionic acids in the feed. This community adaptation suggests that mixed culture PHA production is a robust process.",

This results in a variety of physiological responses leading to altered growth parameters, including growth inhibition or activation of secondary metabolism pathways. Moreover, the expression of other plasmid-encoded genes such as antibiotic resistance genes or repressor proteins may also alter growth kinetics.In this work, we have developed a second-generation system suitable for Escherichia coli expression with an antibiotic-free plasmid maintenance mechanism based on a glycine auxotrophic marker (glyA). Metabolic burden related to plasmid maintenance and heterologous protein expression was minimized by tuning the expression levels of the repressor protein (LacI) and glyA using a library of promoters and applying synthetic biology tools that allow the rapid construction of vectors. The engineered antibiotic-free expression system was applied to the l-fuculose phosphate aldolase (FucA) over-production, showing an increase in production up to 3.8-fold in terms of FucA yield (mg g−1DCW) and 4.5-fold in terms of FucA activity (AU g−1DCW) compared to previous expression. Moreover, acetic acid production was reduced to 50%, expressed as gAc gDCW−1.Our results showed that the aforementioned approaches are of paramount importance in order to increment the protein production in terms of mass and activity.",

     "abstract": "This study examined community responses to use of genetically modified (GM) content in food in the context of responses to familiar food additives by testing an empirically and theoretically derived model of the predictors of responses to both GM content and food integrity issues generally. A nationwide sample of 849 adults, selected at random from the Australian Electoral Roll, responded to a postal Food and Health Survey. Structural equation modelling analyses confirmed that ratings of general concern about food integrity (related to the presence of preservatives and other additives) strongly predicted negativity towards GM content. Concern about food integrity was, in turn, predicted by environmental concern and health engagement. In addition, both concern about food integrity generally and responses to GM content specifically were weakly predicted by attitudes to benefits of science and an intuitive (i.e., emotionally-based) reasoning style. Data from a follow-up survey conducted under the same conditions (N = 1184) revealed that ratings of concern were significantly lower for use of genetic engineering in food than for four other common food integrity issues examined. Whereas the question of community responses to GM is often treated as a special issue, these findings support the conclusion that responses to the concept of GM content in food in Australia are substantially a specific instance of a general sensitivity towards the integrity of the food supply. They indicate that the origins of responses to GM content may be largely indistinguishable from those of general responses to preservatives and other common food additives.",

     "abstract": "In bioethanol production processes, the media composition has an impact on product concentration, yields and the overall process economics. The main purpose of this research was to develop a low-cost mineral-based supplement for successful alcoholic fermentation in an attempt to provide an economically feasible alternative to produce bioethanol from novel sources, for example, sugary industrial wastewaters. Statistical experimental designs were used to select essential nutrients for yeast fermentation, and its optimal concentrations were estimated by Response Surface Methodology. Fermentations were performed on synthetic media inoculated with 2.0 g L−1 of yeast, and the evolution of biomass, sugar, ethanol, CO2 and glycerol were monitored over time. A mix of salts [10.6 g L−1 (NH4)2HPO4; 6.4 g L−1 MgSO4·7H2O and 7.5 mg L−1 ZnSO4·7H2O] was found to be optimal. It led to the complete fermentation of the sugars in less than 12 h with an average ethanol yield of 0.42 gethanol/gsugar. A general C-balance indicated that no carbonaceous compounds different from biomass, ethanol, CO2 or glycerol were produced in significant amounts in the fermentation process. Similar results were obtained when soft drink wastewaters were tested to evaluate the potential industrial application of this supplement. The ethanol yields were very close to those obtained when yeast extract was used as the supplement, but the optimized mineral-based medium is six times cheaper, which favorably impacts the process economics and makes this supplement more attractive from an industrial viewpoint.",

Magnetic beads coated with annexin A5 (ANX-beads), which bound to phosphatidylserine moieties on the surfaces of most EVs, were tested for their ability to capture induced apoptotic bodies in vitro and other phosphatidylserine-presenting vesicles in body fluids. Our results show that up to 60% of induced apoptotic bodies could be captured by the ANX-beads. The vesicles captured from cultured media or plasma contained amplifiable RNA. Suitable blood samples for EV collection included EDTA-plasma and serum but not heparin-plasma. In addition, EVs in plasma were labile to freeze-and-thaw cycles. In rodents xenografted with human cancer cells, tumor-derived mRNA could be detected in EVs captured from serum samples. Active proteins could be detected in EVs captured from ascites but not from plasma. In conclusion, we have developed a magnetic bead-based procedure for the collection of EVs from body fluids and proved that captured EVs contain biomolecules from their parent cells, and therefore have great potential for disease diagnosis.",

The influence of these parameters on the degradation of H2S was clearly underlined, showing the need for their control, performed through an increase of watering flow rate.

The effect of two commercially available nZVI products, Nanofer 25 (non-stabilized) and Nanofer 25S (stabilized), was examined. Considerable toxicity to the soil yeast Trichosporon cutaneum was observed. Two chemically different humic substances (HSs) were studied as a possible protection agent that mitigates nZVI toxicity: oxidized oxyhumolite X6 and humic acid X3A. The effect of addition of HSs was studied in different phases of the experiment to establish the effect on cells and nZVI. SEM and TEM images revealed an ability of both types of nZVI and HSs to adsorb on surface of the cells. Changes in cell surface properties were also observed by zeta potential measurements. Our results indicate that HSs can act as an electrosteric barrier, which hinders mutual interaction between nZVI and treated cell. Thus, the application of HS seems to be a promising solution to mitigating the toxic action of nZVI.",

Pretreatment conditions with severities from 3.05 to 4.12 were compared in order to identify conditions that favour the recovery of hemicellulose-derived sugars, cellulose digestibility or the combined sugars yield (CSY) from the pretreatment-enzymatic hydrolysis.Xylose oligosaccharide was the major sugar in hydrolysates from all pretreatment conditions. Maximum hemicellulose-sugars recovery (52% of the feedstock content) was obtained at 200°C and 5 min. The highest cellulose digestibility (95%) was found at 200°C – 15 min, although glucose recovery from hydrolysis was maximised at 200°C – 10 min (digestibility >92%) due to higher mass yield of pretreated solids. The maximum CSY (nearly 77% of theoretical content) was obtained at 200°C – 5 min. Sugar loss after pretreatment was observed to higher extent at harsher severities. However, the concentrations of sugar degradation products and acetic acid were at levels below tolerance limits of the downstream biological conversions.Steam explosion pretreatment without acid impregnation is a good technology for production of fermentable sugars from triticale straw. This work provides foundation for future autohydrolysis steam explosion optimization studies to enhanced sugars recovery and digestibility of triticale straw.",

However, their separation is required before they can be applied for further applications. Electrodialysis (ED) is a promising separation method, but its efficiency needs to be improved when separating AAs with similar isoelectric points. Thus, specific conversions are required to form product with different charges. Here we studied the enzymatic conversions which can be used as a means to aid the ED separation of neutral AAs. A model mixture containing l-serine, l-phenylalanine and l-methionine was used. The reactions of l-serine decarboxylase and l-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase were employed to specifically convert serine and phenylalanine into ethanolamine and trans-cinnamic acid. At the isoelectric point of methionine (pH 5.74), the charge of ethanolamine and trans-cinnamic acid are +1 and –1, therefore facilitating potential separation into three different streams by electrodialysis.

A simultaneous decrease in growth rate, total protein content, cell size, and the percentage of cells in the S/G2 phase of cell cycle, as well as an increase in the percentage of cells with a CD71−/GpA+ surface marker profile, indicates HSPC differentiation into red blood cells. Compared with proliferating HSPCs, differentiating HSPCs showed significantly lower glucose and glutamine consumption rates, lactate and ammonia production rates, and amino acid consumption and production rates in both SS and SF conditions. Furthermore, extracellular acidification was associated with late proliferation phase, suggesting a reduced cellular metabolic rate during the transition from proliferation to differentiation. Under both SS and SF conditions, cells demonstrated a high metabolic rate with a mixed metabolism of both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in early and late proliferation, an increased dependence on OXPHOS activity during differentiation, and a shift to glycolytic metabolism only during maturation phase. These changes indicate that cell metabolism may have an important impact on the ability of HSPCs to proliferate and differentiate into red blood cells.",

     "abstract": "This study aimed to isolate mercury resistant bacteria, determine the minimum inhibitory concentration for Hg, estimate mercury removal by selected isolates, explore the mer genes, and detect and characterize the activity of the enzyme mercuric (II) reductase produced by a new strain of Pseudomonas sp. B50A. The Hg removal capacity of the isolates was determined by incubating the isolates in Luria Bertani broth and the remaining mercury quantified by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. A PCR reaction was carried out to detect the merA gene and the mercury (II) reductase activity was determined in a spectrophotometer at 340 nm. Eight Gram-negative bacterial isolates were resistant to high mercury concentrations and capable of removing mercury, and of these, five were positive for the gene merA. The isolate Pseudomonas sp. B50A removed 86% of the mercury present in the culture medium and was chosen for further analysis of its enzyme activity. Mercuric (II) reductase activity was detected in the crude extract of this strain. This enzyme showed optimal activity at pH 8 and at temperatures between 37°C and 45°C. The ions NH4+, Ba2+, Sn2+, Ni2+ and Cd2+ neither inhibited nor stimulated the enzyme activity but it decreased in the presence of the ions Ca2+, Cu+ and K+. The isolate and the enzyme detected were effective in reducing Hg(II) to Hg(0), showing the potential to develop bioremediation technologies and processes to clean-up the environment and waste contaminated with mercury.",

     "abstract": "Haloferax mediterranei was cultivated in highly saline medium using cheese whey as the substrate for the production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), P(3HB-co-3HV). Acid hydrolysis provided a simple inexpensive method to obtain a cheese whey hydrolysate that was used for cultivation of H. mediterranei.Batch bioreactor cultivation of H. mediterranei resulted in the production of an active biomass concentration of 7.54 g L−1 with a polymer content of 53%, and a volumetric productivity of 4.04 g L−1 day−1. Supplementation of the cultivation medium with micronutrients favored galactose consumption that was used for polymer synthesis after exhaustion of the available glucose. P(3HB-co-3HV) with a 3-hydroxyvalerate content of 1.5 mol% was extracted from the biomass by hypo-osmotic shock. The polymer presented a molecular mass of 4.4 × 105, with a polydispersity index of 1.5. This work demonstrated the feasibility of using cheese whey for the production of a value-added biopolymer with high volumetric productivity, by using a glucose- and galactose-rich substrate obtained by acid hydrolysis of cheese whey. The use of H. mediterranei as the producing strain avoids the need for strict sterility due to the culture's high salinity requirements and, also, allows for polymer extraction by simply contacting the biomass with water.",

This control is even more difficult to achieve when the polymer is not synthesized by chemists, but produced by nature, in this case, bacteria. In this study mechanism and role of two 3-hydroxyvalerate (3-HV) inducing substrates on the production of PHBV with high, 80%, 3-HV content were evaluated. It was found that levulinic acid contributes to biomass and bio-polymer content enhancement, whereas sodium propionate mainly contributes to 3-HV enhancement. Optimized proportions of feeding substrates at 1 g/L and 2.5 g/L, respectively for levulinic acid and sodium propionate allowed a 100% productivity enhancement, at 3.9 mg/L/hour, for the production of PHBV with 80% 3-HV.",

Inactivation of UGPase in P. tricornutum led to a significant decrease in chrysolaminaran content and an increase in lipid synthesis.

When fed a manure slurry of 10% total solid (TS), similar system performance, 36–38% volatile solid (VS) removal and 0.21–0.22 L methane g−1 VS fed, was achieved between a 5-day and 7.5-day HRT for the thermophilic digester. However, the thermophilic digester achieved a greater volumetric biogas yield when operated at a 5-day RT than at a 7.5-day HRT (6.3 vs. 4.7 L/L/d), while the mesophilic digester had a stable volumetric biogas yield (about 1.0 L/L/d). Each of the digesters harbored distinct yet dynamic microbial populations, and some of the methanogens were significantly correlated with methane productions. Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta were the most important methanogenic genera in the thermophilic and the mesophilic digesters, respectively. The microbiological findings may help understand the metabolism that underpins the anaerobic processes within each of the two digesters of TPAD systems when fed dairy manure.",

Nowadays, coffee is the second largest traded commodity in the world, after petroleum. Hence, coffee industry is responsible for the generation of large amounts of waste, especially spent coffee grounds (SCG). Various attempts to valorize this waste stream of coffee industry were made. This article summarizes our research and publications aiming at the conversion of SCG into valuable products – polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and carotenoids. At first, oil extracted from SCG (approx. 15 wt% oil in SCG) can be efficiently (YP/S = 0.82 g/g) converted into PHA employing Cupriavidus necator H16. Further, the solid residues after oil extraction can be hydrolyzed (by the combination of chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis) yielding fermentable sugars, which can be further used as a substrate for the production of PHAs employing Bacillus megaterium (YP/S = 0.04 g/g) or Burkholderia cepacia (YP/S = 0.24 g/g). Alternatively, SCG hydrolysate can be used as a substrate for biotechnological production of carotenoids by carotenogenic yeast Sporobolomyces roseus. Solid residues after either oil extraction or hydrolysis can be used as fuel in industrial boilers to generate heat and energy. Therefore, entire biomass of SCG can be used for sustainable production of PHAs and/or carotenoids employing bio-refinery approach.",

Numerous strains of microalgae have already been assessed as feedstocks for bioethanol and biodiesel production, but commercial scale algal biofuel production is yet to be demonstrated, most likely due to huge energy costs associated with algae cultivation, harvesting and processing. Biorefining, integrated processes for the conversion of biomass into a variety of products, can improve the prospects of microalgal biofuels by combining them with the production of high value co-products. Numerous microalgal strains in China have been identified as producers of various high value by-products with wide application in the medicine, food, and cosmetics industries. This paper reviews microalgae resources in China and their potential in producing liquid biofuels (bioethanol and biodiesel) and high value products in an integrated biorefinery approach. Implementation of a ‘high value product first’ principle should make the integrated process of fuels and chemicals production economically feasible and will ensure that public and private interest in the development of microalgal biotechnology is maintained.",

Such operations are free from material erosion by competing metabolic pathways, from kinetic restrictions by physical barriers and regulating circuits, and from toxicity problems with reactive foreign substrates, which are notorious problems in whole-cell systems.

Temperature and concentrations of glycerol and Na2HPO4 are the experimental variables with the most significant influence on PHB production by B2.

In contrast, under the same conditions, a maximum PHB concentration of 1.20 g/L in the bioreactor was reached at 11 hours. These values correspond to a 48% and 314% increase in PHB production compared to the initial culture conditions. These results suggest the potential of B2 as a PHB producer using raw glycerol, which is an inexpensive, abundant and readily available carbon source.",

     "abstract": "The yield of heterologous proteins is often limited by several bottlenecks in the secretory pathway of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It was shown earlier that synthesis of measles virus hemagglutinin (MeH) is inefficient mostly due to a bottleneck in the translocation of viral protein precursors into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of yeast cells. Here we report that heat shock with subsequent induction of MeH expression at 37 °C improved translocation of MeH precursors when applied at higher cell densities. The amount of MeH glycoprotein increased by about 3-fold after heat shock in the late-log phases of both glucose and ethanol growth. The same temperature conditions increased both secretion titer and yield of another heterologous protein human GRP78/BiP by about 50%. Furthermore, heat shock at the late-log glucose growth phase also improved endogenous invertase yield by approximately 2.7-fold. In contrast, a transfer of yeast culture to lower temperature at diauxic shift followed by protein expression at 20 °C almost totally inhibited translocation of MeH precursors. The difference in amounts of MeH glycoprotein under expression at 37 °C and 20 °C was about 80-fold, while amounts of unglycosylated MeH polypeptides were similar under both conditions. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed that besides over-expressed ER-resident chaperone Kar2, an increased expression of several cytosolic proteins (such as Hsp104, Hsp90 and eEF1A) may contribute to improved translocation of MeH.",

In this study, whey has been selected as the most technologically and economically suitable primary substrate for anaerobic in situ biodegradation of TNT. Under laboratory conditions, various additions of whey, molasses, acetate and activated sludge as an inoculant were tested and the process was monitored using numerous chemical analyses including phospholipid fatty acid analysis. The addition of whey resulted in the removal of more than 90% of the TNT in real contaminated soil (7 mg kg−1 and 12 mg kg−1 of TNT). The final bioremediation strategy was suggested on the basis of the laboratory results and tested under real conditions at a TNT contaminated site in the Czech Republic. During the pilot test, three repeated injections of whey suspension into the sandy aquifer were performed over a 10-month period. In total, approximately 5 m3 of whey were used. A substantial decrease in the TNT groundwater concentration from the original levels (equalling 1.49 mg l−1 to 8.58 mg l−1) was observed in most of the injection wells, while the concentrations of the TNT biotransformation products were found to be elevated. Pilot-scale application results showed that the anoxic and/or anaerobic conditions in the aquifer were sufficient for TNT bio-reduction by autochthonous microorganisms. Whey application was not accompanied by undesirable effects such as a substantial decrease in the pH or clogging of the wells. The results of the study document the suitability of application of whey to bioremediate TNT contaminated sites in situ.",

The latter appears to be instantaneously reduced to p-aminophenol, as that in turn was detected as the first stable intermediate. This study investigated the downstream pathway of sulfonamide antibiotics by testing the strain's ability to degrade suspected intermediates of this pathway. While p-aminophenol was degraded, degradation products could not be identified. Benzoquinone was shown to be degraded to hydroquinone and hydroquinone in turn was shown to be degraded to 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene. The latter is assumed to be the potential substrate for aromatic ring cleavage. However, no products from the degradation of 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene could be identified. There are no signs of accumulation of intermediates causing oxidative stress, which makes Microbacterium sp. strain BR1 an interesting candidate for industrial waste water treatment.",

However, engineering and understanding of microbial heat tolerance are difficult and insufficient because it is a complex physiological trait which probably correlates with all gene functions, genetic regulations, and cellular metabolisms and activities. In this work, a novel strain engineering approach named Genome Replication Engineering Assisted Continuous Evolution (GREACE) was employed to improve the heat tolerance of Escherichia coli. When the E. coli strain carrying a mutator was cultivated under gradually increasing temperature, genome-wide mutations were continuously generated during genome replication and the mutated strains with improved thermotolerance were autonomously selected. A thermotolerant strain HR50 capable of growing at 50°C on LB agar plate was obtained within two months, demonstrating the efficiency of GREACE in improving such a complex physiological trait. To understand the improved heat tolerance, genomes of HR50 and its wildtype strain DH5α were sequenced. Evenly distributed 361 mutations covering all mutation types were found in HR50. Closed material transportations, loose genome conformation, and possibly altered cell wall structure and transcription pattern were the main differences of HR50 compared with DH5α, which were speculated to be responsible for the improved heat tolerance. This work not only expanding our understanding of microbial heat tolerance, but also emphasizing that the in vivo continuous genome mutagenesis method, GREACE, is efficient in improving microbial complex physiological trait.",

Phytopathogenic fungi of the genus Claviceps (e.g. C. purpurea) comprise a major biological source of ergot alkaloids. Worldwide industrial production of these alkaloids derives almost equally from two biotechnological procedures: submerged culture of the fungus in fermenters and field parasitic production in dormant fungal organs known as sclerotia (also termed ergot). Ergot yields from field cultivation are greatly affected by weather and also can be much reduced by pollen contamination from imperfectly male-sterile rye, as only unfertilized ovaries can be infected by C. purpurea spores. Two substances with gametocidal effect – maleic hydrazide and 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid – were tested during three consecutive seasons in small field experiments for the ability to induce or amplify the male sterility of rye as well as the impacts on germination of C. purpurea spores and general vitality of rye host plants. Maleic hydrazide was proven to be a highly effective gametocide on both a fertile rye variety and a variety with imperfectly induced cytoplasmic male sterility. It showed negligible effect on germination of C. purpurea spores. Both accurate dosaging of the active gametocidal compound and timing of the application just 2–3 weeks before onset of anthesis proved crucial to achieving high ergot yield with minimum grain impurities.",

The presence of magnesium on both normal (hFOB) and cancer (SaOS-2) osteoblast cell behavior was investigated in (Ti,Mg)N surfaces with or without prior hydroxyapatite (HA) deposition (in simulated body fluid, SBF). Mg incorporation on TiN films was found to have no apparent effect on the cell proliferation in bare surfaces but cell spreading was better on low Mg content surface for hFOB cells. SaOS-2 cells, on the other hand, showed an increased extra cellular matrix (ECM) deposition on low Mg surfaces but ECM deposition almost disappeared when Mg content was increased above 10 at%. HA deposited surfaces with high Mg content was shown to cause a significant decrease in cell viability. While the cells were flattened, elongated and spread over the surface in contact with each other via cellular extensions on unmodified and low Mg doped surfaces, unhealthy morphologies of cells with round shape with a limited number of extended arms was visualized on high Mg containing samples. In summary, Mg incorporation into the TiN coatings by arc-PVD technique and successive HA deposition led to promising cell responses on low Mg content surfaces for a better osteointegration performance.",

Recent progress in the manipulation and synthesis of colloidal particles with well-defined surface properties and shapes makes them ideal candidates to probe the fundamental surface properties leading to dynamic wetting effects.

     "abstract": "Magnetic micro- and nanoparticles (‘magnetic beads’) have been used to advantage in many microfluidic devices for sensitive antigen (Ag) detection. Today, assays that use as read-out of the signal the number count of immobilized beads on a surface for quantification of a sample's analyte concentration have been among the most sensitive and have allowed protein detection lower than the fg mL−1 concentration range. Recently, we have proposed in this category a magnetic bead surface coverage assay (Tekin et al., 2013 [1]), in which ‘large’ (2.8 μm) antibody (Ab)-functionalized magnetic beads captured their Ag from a serum and these Ag-carrying beads were subsequently exposed to a surface pattern of fixed ‘small’ (1.0 μm) Ab-coated magnetic beads. When the system was exposed to a magnetic induction field, the magnet dipole attractive interactions between the two bead types were used as a handle to approach both bead surfaces and assist with Ag–Ab immunocomplex formation, while unspecific binding (in absence of an Ag) of a large bead was reduced by exploiting viscous drag flow. The dose–response curve of this type of assay had two remarkable features: (i) its ability to detect an output signal (i.e. bead number count) for very low Ag concentrations, and (ii) an output signal of the assay that was non-linear with respect to Ag concentration. We explain here the observed dose–response curves and show that the type of interactions and the concept of our assay are in favour of detecting the lowest analyte concentrations (where typically either zero or one Ag is carried per large bead), while higher concentrations are less efficiently detected. We propose a random walk process for the Ag-carrying bead over the magnetic landscape of small beads and this model description explains the enhanced overall capture probability of this assay and its particular non-linear dose response curves.",

Here, a single molecule magnetic torque tweezers study is reported, aiming to quantify surfactant-induced changes in the torsional flexibility of a protein model system: protein-G–immunoglobulin G (IgG) attached to a glass surface. The influences of Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS) and Polysorbate 20 (Tween 20) on the protein pair have been investigated. The proteins were exposed to the surfactants at concentrations relative to the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC), namely 0.1× CMC, 1× CMC and 10× CMC. Both surfactants increase the torsional flexibility of the protein-G–IgG complex. Tween 20 is most effective at increasing the torsional flexibility of the complex at the surface while SDS is more effective at dissociating the protein bonds. Tweezer data on the IgG–IgG protein pair show no influence of Tween 20 on the torsional flexibility. Furthermore, temperature dependent near-UV and far-UV Circular Dichroism (CD) data at 10× CMC show that Tween 20 does not significantly alter the secondary and tertiary structure of both protein-G and IgG while SDS does. These results provide evidence that both the mechanical properties of the protein structure and the interaction between proteins can alter the torsional rigidity measured with magnetic torque tweezers. This study shows for the first time the ability to use magnetic torque tweezers as a probe for surfactant-induced changes in proteins at a single molecule level.",

     "abstract": "Molecular interferences are an important challenge in biotechnologies based on antibody–antigen interactions, such as sandwich immunoassays. We report how a sandwich immunoassay with magnetic particles as label can be used to probe interference by surfactants. Surfactants are often used to improve the performance of immunoassays, however the surfactants can affect the involved proteins and the mechanism of action of surfactant molecules on the antibody–antigen system is mostly unknown. As an example, we investigated molecular interference by a nonionic surfactant (Pluronic F-127) in a cardiac troponin (cTn) sandwich immunoassay with two monoclonal antibodies. The influence of the surfactant below the critical micelle concentration (0.00–0.04%) on dissociation properties was quantified in a magnetic tweezers setup, where a force is applied to the molecules via magnetic particle labels. The force-dependent dissociation curves revealed the existence of two distinct cTn-dependent bond types, namely a weak bond attributable to non-specific binding of cTn, and a strong bond attributable to the specific binding of cTn. The dissociation rate constant of the strong bonds increased with the surfactant concentration by about a factor of two. Circular dichroism spectroscopy data showed that the nonionic surfactant influences the conformation of cTn while not noticeably affecting the two monoclonal antibodies. This suggests that the surfactant-induced increase of the dissociation rate of the specific sandwich-type cTn binding may be related to a conformational change of the antigen molecule. The described methodology is an effective tool to study the influence of surfactants and other interferences on assays based on protein interactions.",

The proteins were bound to magnetic particles and polystyrene surfaces by EDC/NHS reaction chemistry and by physisorption, respectively. Two different molecular configurations have been investigated, with either the Ara h 1 protein on the particles or the Ara h 1 protein on the polystyrene surface. A model with a Gaussian distribution of energy barriers for dissociation gives an adequate description for the measured multi-exponential decays. We hypothesize that distributions of molecular orientations as well as experimentally induced variations may underlay the observed distributions. The two molecular configurations show a different peak value of the energy distribution. Similarly, SPR experiments for two distinct configurations (either Ara h 1 protein on the surface, or anti-Ara h 1 antibody on the surface) also show clear differences in dissociation behavior. We hypothesize that the multivalency of the involved molecules leads to different modes of binding.

By computing the scattering efficiency of doublets and singlets, we demonstrate the absolute quantification of a few % of doublets in a well dispersed suspension. More generally, these optical variations are related to the aggregation state of the sample. This method can be easily applied to an agglutination assay, where target proteins induce aggregation of colloidal particles. By observing only aligned clusters, we increase sensitivity and we reduce the background noise as compared to a classical agglutination assay: we obtain a detection limit on the C-reactive protein of less than 3 pM for a total assay time of 10 min.",

Although most of these major infectious diseases are treatable, the early identification of individuals requiring treatment remains a major issue. The incidence of these diseases would be reduced if rapid diagnostic tests were widely available at the community and primary care level in low-resource settings. Strong research efforts are thus being focused on replacing standard clinical diagnostic methods, such as the invasive detection techniques (biopsy or endoscopy) or expensive diagnostic and monitoring methods, by affordable and sensitive tests based on novel biomarkers. The development of new methods that are needed includes solid-phase separation techniques. In this context, the integration of magnetic particles within bioassays and biosensing devices is very promising since they greatly improve the performance of a biological reaction. The diagnosis of clinical samples with magnetic particles can be easily achieved without pre-enrichment, purification or pretreatment steps often required for standard methods, simplifying the analytical procedures. The biomarkers can be specifically isolated and preconcentrated from complex biological matrixes by magnetic actuation, increasing specificity and the sensitivity of the assay.

At the end of this research project students submit a research paper on their field and laboratory activities and discuss their experimental data and observations.

Each collection site is recorded on a Google Maps module and the data from student research activities is made available to other undergraduate students. This data is then used to generate a microorganism database of pesticide degrading activity and promote reading, critical thinking, and analytical skills as part of the curriculum. Our sampling of agricultural sites and wastewater within and around the city of Houston has identified seven distinct genera of OP degrading organisms, including Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Exiguobacterium, Delftia, Agrobacterium, Aeromonas, and Rhizobium.

Cell permeabilization lead to an efficient bioconversion by β-galactosidase resulting in synthesis of GOS. A maximum GOS yield of 36% (w/w) of total sugars was achieved and the products consisted of tri- and tetra-galacto-oligosaccharides. A lactose conversion rate of 80% and productivity of 24 g/L/h was obtained under the optimum conditions at lactose concentration of 20% (w/v), temperature 40°C, pH 6.5 and enzyme units after 3 h of reaction time. Tetrasaccharides were the main component of the reaction mixture. The products were quantitated by HPLC and structurally characterized by mass spectrometry.",

     "publication date": "05-2015",
     "abstract": "Facile co-immobilization of enzymes is highly desirable for bioconversion methods involving multi-enzymatic cascade reactions. Here we show for the first time that three enzymes can be immobilized in flat-sheet polymeric membranes simultaneously or separately by simple pressure-driven filtration (i.e. by directing membrane fouling formation), without any addition of organic solvent. Such co-immobilization and sequential immobilization systems were examined for the production of methanol from CO2 with formate dehydrogenase (FDH), formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FaldDH) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Enzyme activity was fully retained by this non-covalent immobilization strategy. The two immobilization systems had similar catalytic efficiencies because the second reaction (formic acid → formaldehyde) catalyzed by FaldDH was found to be the cascade bottleneck (a threshold substrate concentration was required). Moreover, the trade-off between the mitigation of product inhibition and low substrate concentration for the adjacent enzymes probably made the co-immobilization meaningless. Thus, sequential immobilization could be used for multi-enzymatic cascade reactions, as it allowed the operational conditions for each single step to be optimized, not only during the enzyme immobilization but also during the reaction process, and the pressure-driven mass transfer (flow-through mode) could overcome the diffusion resistance between enzymes. This study not only offers a green and facile immobilization method for multi-enzymatic cascade systems, but also reveals the reaction bottleneck and provides possible solutions for the bioconversion of CO2 to methanol.",

     "abstract": "Fusion of the sugar-starvation-induced αAmy3 promoter with its signal peptide has enabled secretion of recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) into the culture medium. To simplify the production process and increase the rHSA yield in rice suspension cells, a one-step strategem without medium change was adopted. The yield of rHSA was increased sixfold by this one-step approach compared with the two-step recombinant protein process, in which a change of the culture medium to sugar-free medium is required. The one-step strategem was applied to check repeated cycle of rHSA production, and the production of rHSA was also higher in each cycle in the one-step, as opposed to the two-step, production process. The use of the one-step process resulted in fewer damaged cells during the cell sugar starvation phase for recombinant protein production. Furthermore, we scaled up the rHSA production in a 2-L airlift and a 2-L stirred tank bioreactor by the one-step approach, and concluded that rHSA can be enriched to 45 mg L−1 in plant culture commonly used MS medium by the airlift-type bioreactor. Our results suggest that rHSA production can be enriched by this optimized cultivation strategem.",

     "abstract": "Vanillin is one of the world's most important flavor and fragrance compounds in foods and cosmetics. Recently, we demonstrated that vanillin could be produced from ferulic acid via 4-vinylguaiacol in a coenzyme-independent manner using the decarboxylase Fdc and the oxygenase Cso2. In this study, we investigated a new two-pot bioprocess for vanillin production using the whole-cell catalyst of Escherichia coli expressing Fdc in the first stage and that of E. coli expressing Cso2 in the second stage. We first optimized the second-step Cso2 reaction from 4-vinylguaiacol to vanillin, a rate-determining step for the production of vanillin. Addition of FeCl2 to the cultivation medium enhanced the activity of the resulting E. coli cells expressing Cso2, an iron protein belonging to the carotenoid cleavage oxygenase family. Furthermore, a butyl acetate–water biphasic system was effective in improving the production of vanillin. Under the optimized conditions, we attempted to produce vanillin from ferulic acid by a two-pot bioprocess on a flask scale. In the first stage, E. coli cells expressing Fdc rapidly decarboxylated ferulic acid and completely converted 75 mM of this substrate to 4-vinylguaiacol within 2 h at pH 9.0. After the first-stage reaction, cells were removed from the reaction mixture by centrifugation, and the pH of the resulting supernatant was adjusted to 10.5, the optimal pH for Cso2. This solution was subjected to the second-stage reaction. In the second stage, E. coli cells expressing Cso2 efficiently oxidized 4-vinylguaiacol to vanillin. The concentration of vanillin reached 52 mM (7.8 g L−1) in 24 h, which is the highest level attained to date for the biotechnological production of vanillin using recombinant cells.",

     "abstract": "Among agro-wastes, olive mill wastewater (OMW) truly qualifies as a high impact organic residue due to its biochemical-rich composition and high annual production. In the present investigation, dephenolized OMW (OMWdeph) was employed as the feedstock for a biotechnological two-stage anaerobic process dedicated to the production of biohydrogen and volatile fatty acids (VFAs), respectively. To this end, two identically configured packed-bed biofilm reactors were operated sequentially. In the first, the hydraulic retention time was set to 1 day, whereas in the second it was equal to 5 days. The rationale was to decouple the hydrolysis of the organic macronutrients held by the OMWdeph, so as to quantitatively generate a biogas enriched in H2 (first stage aim), for the acidogenesis of the residual components left after hydrolysis, to then produce a highly concentrated mixture of VFAs (second stage aim). Results showed that the generation of H2 and VFAs was effectively split, with carbohydrates and lipids, respectively, being the main substrates of the two processes. About 250 ml H2 L−1 day−1 was produced, corresponding to a yield of 0.36 mol mol−1 of consumed carbohydrates (expressed as glucose equivalents). The overall concentration of VFAs in the acidogenic process was 13.80 g COD L−1, so that 2.76 g COD L−1 day−1 was obtained. Second generation biorefineries use a selected fraction of an organic waste to conduct a microbiologically-driven pathway towards the generation of one target molecule. With the proposed approach, a greater value of the waste was attained, since the multi-purpose two-stage process did not entail competition for substrates between the first and the second steps.",

It is hardly or not degraded during the conventional technology used in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (up to 7%) and many studies have found it ubiquitous in various environmental matrices in concentrations typically ranging from μg L−1 to ng L−1.Streptomyces MIUG 4.89 was previously studied for its ability in carbamazepine biodegradation (up to 14%) during cultivation in submerged system under aerobic conditions at an initial CBZ concentration of 0.2 mg L−1. The influence of some factors (independent variables) upon biodegradation potential was examined by Plackett–Burman analysis. Central composite design of experiments (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM) were used to get more information about the significant effects and their interactions of the five parameters selected upon their biodegradation potential in order to increase the elimination yield of this drug from a liquid medium. The investigated ranges of the independent variables were: 1.0–3.0 g L−1 yeast extract, 3.0–10.0 g L−1 glucose, 4.0–10.0% (v/v) inoculation level, pH 5.0–7.0 and 50–250 mL of medium at a constant initial concentration of carbamazepine (CBZ) of 0.2 mg L−1. The response surface analysis results showed that the capacity of the selected strain Streptomyces MIUG 4.89 to degrade carbamazepine was high in submerged cultivation system by cultivation in a liquid medium containing 6.5 g L−1 glucose and 2 g L−1 yeast extract, inoculated at 7% (v/v) and cultivated at pH 6.0, during 7 days of incubation at 25 °C and 150 rpm.

Kinetic studies revealed three distinct stages of the biosorption process. The pseudo-second order model and the Langmuir model described well the kinetics and equilibrium of the biosorption process, with a determination coefficient, R2 > 0.99. The value of the mean free energy of adsorption, E, is less than 16 kJ/mol at 25°C, suggesting that, at low temperature, the dominant process involved in Cd(II) biosorption by dead T. viride is the chemical ion-exchange. With the temperature increasing to 40–50°C, E values are above 16 kJ/mol, showing that the particle diffusion mechanism could play an important role in Cd(II) biosorption.The studies on T. viride growth in Cd(II) solutions and its bioaccumulation performance showed that the living biomass was able to bioaccumulate 100% Cd(II) from a 50 mg/L solution at pH 6.0.The influence of pH, biomass dosage, metal concentration, contact time and temperature on the bioremoval efficiency was evaluated to further assess the biosorption capability of the dead biosorbent. These complex influences were correlated by means of a modeling procedure consisting in data driven approach in which the principles of artificial intelligence were applied with the help of support vector machines (SVM), combined with genetic algorithms (GA). According to our data, the optimal working conditions for the removal of 98.91% Cd(II) by T. viride were found for an aqueous solution containing 26.11 mg/L Cd(II) as follows: pH 6.0, contact time of 3833 min, 8 g/L biosorbent, temperature 46.5°C.

The heavy metals concentrations were analysed by using an Atomic Absorption Spectrometer with graphite furnace, the results being further used to calculate the bioconcentration factors for a few key taxa like green and red algae, molluscs and fishes.Seven sampling sites influenced by anthropogenic pollution sources (municipal wastewater treatment plants and diffuse sources) were considered and a total of 300 samples were analysed for the period 2011–2012, this being the first unitary study for the Romanian Black Sea marine ecosystem.In 2011 and 2012 there were no significant differences between the sampling areas considering the heavy metals concentrations in water. For the sediments significant differences were observed between sampling sites for some heavy metals, namely Pb in 2011 and Pb, Cu and Cd in 2012, the highest concentrations being registered in the southern sector of the Romanian Black Sea shore, where the anthropogenic pollution sources are represented by the harbour and wastewater treatment plants.The values of the bioaccumulation factors (BCFsed) shows that algae are good accumulators for Cu > Pb > Ni > Cr > Cd, in comparison with BCFwater where the order of heavy metal accumulation was different: Cr > Ni > Pb > Cd > Cu. Molluscs have higher bioconcentration factors for Cu and Cd for sediments and for Cu and Ni for water. Rapana venosa accumulated more Cd and Cu. For fishes, Pb, Cu and Ni had the highest values in the tissues of benthonic species Mullus barbatus. In bivalve molluscs and fishes, in the majority of cases, there were not recorded exceeding mean concentrations as compared to the maximum allowed concentrations for Cd and Pb.",

     "abstract": "Aromatic amines are important industrial products having in their molecular structure one or more aromatic rings. These are used as precursors for the synthesis of dyes, adhesives, pesticides, rubber, fertilizers and surfactants. The aromatic amines are common constituents of industrial effluents, generated mostly by the degradation of azo dyes. Several of them are a threat to human health because they can by toxic, allergenic, mutagenic or carcinogenic. The most common are benzenesulfonic amines, such as 4-ABS (4-aminobenzene sulfonic acid) and naphthalene sulfonic amines, such as 4-ANS (4-amino naphthalene sulfonic acid). Sometimes, the mixtures of toxic compounds are more toxic or inhibitory than the individual compounds, even for microorganisms capable of degrading them. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the degradation of the mixture 4-ANS plus 4-ABS by a bacterial community immobilized in fragments of volcanic stone, using a packed bed continuous reactor. In this reactor, the amines loading rates were varied from 5.5 up to 69 mg L−1 h−1. The removal of the amines was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and chemical oxygen demand. With this information, we have studied the substrate inhibition of the removal rate of the aromatic amines during the degradation of the mixture of sulfonated aromatic amines by the immobilized microorganisms. Experimental results were fitted to parabolic, hyperbolic and linear inhibition models. The model that best characterizes the inhibition of the specific degradation rate in the biofilm reactor was a parabolic model with values of RXM = 58.15 ± 7.95 mg (109 cells h)−1, Ks = 0.73 ± 0.31 mg L−1, Sm = 89.14 ± 5.43 mg L−1 and the exponent m = 5. From the microbial community obtained, six cultivable bacterial strains were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16S rDNA genes. The strains belong to the genera Variovorax, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Arthrobacter, Nocardioides and Microbacterium. This microbial consortium could use the mixture of aromatic amines as sources of carbon, nitrogen, energy and sulfur.",

The aim of the present work was to develop a dual purpose system for the treatment of the anaerobic effluents from pig waste utilizing Neochloris oleoabundans and to evaluate its growth, lipid content and lipid profile of the harvested biomass and the removal of nutrients from the media. Cultures of N. oleoabundans were established in 4 L flat plate photobioreactors using diluted effluents from two different types of anaerobic filters, one packed with ceramic material (D1) and another one packed with volcanic gravel (D2). Maximum biomass concentration in D1 was 0.63 g L−1 which was significantly higher than the one found in D2 (0.55 g L−1). Cultures were very efficient at nutrient removal: 98% for NNH4+ and 98% for PO43−. Regarding total lipid content, diluted eflluents from D2 promoted a biomass containing 27.4% (dry weight) and D1 a biomass containing 22.4% (dry weight). Maximum lipid productivity was also higher in D2 compared to D1 (6.27 ± 0.62 mg L−1 d−1 vs. 5.12 ± 0.12 mg L−1 d−1). Concerning the FAMEs profile in diluted effluents, the most abundant one was C18:1, followed by C18:2 and C16:0. The profile in D2 contained less C18:3 (linolenic acid) than the one in D1 (4.37% vs. 5.55%). In conclusion, this is the first report demonstrating that cultures of N. oleoabundans treating anaerobic effluents from pig waste are very efficient at nutrient removal and a biomass rich in lipids can be recovered. The maximum total lipid content and the most convenient FAMEs profile were obtained using effluents from a digester packed with volcanic gravel.",

     "abstract": "Under adverse environments, plants produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can trigger cell death when their accumulation surpasses the antioxidant capacity of ROS scavenging systems. These systems function in chloroplasts mainly through the ascorbate-mediated water–water cycle, in which ascorbate is photoreduced by ferredoxin in the photosynthetic system. Our previous study showed that the fraction of the reduced form of ascorbate was increased in ferredoxin-transgenic Arabidopsis (CPF) plants which overexpressed plant ferredoxin-like protein (PFLP) in their chloroplasts. Thus, we hypothesized that expression of PFLP could alter the tolerance of plants to abiotic stresses through increasing reduced form of ascorbate. In this study, we found that two CPF lines exhibited lower mortality rates at five days, following two days of heat treatment. Compared to non-transgenic wild type (Col-0) plants, CPF plants exhibited decreased H2O2 content, MDA accumulation, and ion leakage after heat treatment. To confirm the efficacy of ferredoxin against heat stress in chloroplasts, we evaluated two RNA interference (RNAi) lines on two endogenous ferredoxin isoforms, Atfd1 or Atfd2, of Arabidopsis plants. Both lines not only decreased their amounts of ascorbate, but also exhibited adverse reactions following heat treatment. Based on these results, we conclude that expression of PFLP in chloroplasts can confer tolerance to heat stress. This tolerance might be associated with the increasing of ascorbate in plants.",

Bacillus lipopeptides, specifically lipopeptide homologues exhibiting antifungal efficacy, offer an alternative environmentally benign protocol for reduction of postharvest phytopathogens. This work is directed towards Bacillus lipopeptide production for biocontrol of postharvest phytopathogens in general and fungal phytopathogens in particular.Bacillus amyloliquefaciens DSM 23117 was identified as an organism with superior potential for lipopeptide production, via screening of 4 Bacillus candidates, in terms of antifungal lipopeptide concentration, yield, productivity and preferred homologue ratio. Efficacy of B. amyloliquefaciens lipopeptides against Botrytis cinerea substantiated appropriateness of this Bacillus species. Subsequent process modification of B. amyloliquefaciens cultures demonstrated that the concentration and ratio of the lipopeptides were significantly influenced by process conditions and further, distinguished nitrate and oxygen availability as key parameters defining optimal lipopeptide production. Discrete B. amyloliquefaciens cultures supplied with 4, 8, 10 and 12 g/L NH4NO3 demonstrated optimal lipopeptide concentration, yield and productivity, with respect to both total and antifungal lipopeptides, in the culture containing 8 g/L NH4NO3. Enhancement of total and antifungal lipopeptide kinetics similar to those quantified on increasing the nitrate from 4 to 8 g/L NH4NO3 were exhibited in B. amyloliquefaciens cultures when the oxygen in the sparge gas was increased from 21 to 30 mol%. The enhancement of lipopeptide production under conditions of increased nitrate and increased oxygen supply is explained in terms of increased availability of nitrogen for synthesis.This work has highlighted key parameters for maximisation of Bacillus lipopeptide production and manipulation of antifungal/surfactin ratios for optimum efficacy and informs on future development of process strategies towards production optimisation of antifungal lipopeptides as a green alternative to synthetic chemicals.",

The result showed that glucose yield at low enzyme dosage was positively linear correlated with the yield at high enzyme dosage, for both the untreated and pretreated materials. The pretreatment significantly increased the accessibility of substrates by enzyme due to the increase of internal and external surface area. Glucose yield also showed a linear correlation with dye adsorption. However, the increase in glucose yield as a result of pretreatment did not correlate with the increases in crystallinity index and decreases in degree of polymerization. The Principal Component Analysis of infrared data indicated that lignin was the main component that differentiated the varieties before and after pretreatment.

     "abstract": "This study explored the utilization of a white-rot fungus (WRF), Phanerochaete chrysosporium, immobilized in wood chips, to remove carbamazepine and naproxen under non-sterile condition. The removal efficiencies for both pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in artificially contaminated water were improved by 4% for naproxen and 30% for carbamazepine in seven days, compared to without wood chips. Although adsorption was crucial at the early stage, bioremoval was found to be the main removal mechanism for both PhACs. The extracellular enzymes played important role s in the naproxen removal, while the intracellular enzyme system was responsible for the carbamazepine removal. The increased of intracellular enzyme activity through the immobilization of WRF cells may contribute to the significantly enhanced removal efficiency for carbamazepine. In addition, the removal of naproxen or carbamazepine slightly increased when both compounds coexisted, compared to the system where the two pharmaceuticals existed separately. Based on the batch experimental results, a fixed-bed bioreactor packed with a mixture of WRF mycelia pellets and wood chips was developed and operated with the intermittent feeding and continuous aerating mode for 28 days under non-sterile condition, with naproxen and carbamazepine spiked into the influent at 1.0 mg L−1. Almost complete removal of naproxen and 60-80% removal of carbamazepine were obtained in the first two weeks. However, the removal efficiencies for both compounds suddenly dropped to as low as less than 20% by the 14th day, possibly due to the contamination by other microorganisms in the reactor. After the addition of 8.25% sodium hypochlorite at the ratio of 1:100 (v/v) into the influent tank on both Day 20 and Day 25, a rapid recovery (higher than 95%) was achieved in the naproxen removal, by effectively inhibiting contamination in the reactor. In comparison, the same rebounding phenomenon was not observed for carbamazepine and this difference may be associated to the various enzyme-working systems. A longer hydraulic retention time (HRT) was conducive to improve the removal of both compounds.",

In the present study, a full-length cDNA 1793 bp encoding 479 amino acids and βGRP1 was obtained from Plutella xylostella by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (designed as P×βGRP1) which showed significant similarities with other insect's βGRPs. The transcription level was constitutively expressed and upregulated by microbial induction in all life stages of P. xylostella. Tissue distribution showed P×βGRP1 to be mainly expressed in fat body as detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Subsequent to knock down the P×βGRP1 expression and the transcripts of Toll-like receptor, cecropin 1 and cecropin 2 decreased in P. xylostella. Meanwhile, the bacterial colonies increased and the expression of four AMP genes decreased on injection of anti-P×βGRP1 into Bombyx mori. The results demonstrated that P×βGRP1 can play a vital role in response to the expression of AMP genes in P. xylostella.",

The effect of the reaction temperature on the yield and quality of liquid products was discussed. The results showed that the reaction temperature affected the hydrocarbon fuel yield but had a minor influence on its properties. The highest conversion efficiency from sunflower oils to hydrocarbon fuels was 30.1%, which was obtained at 550°C. The reaction temperature affected the component content of the non-condensable gases. The non-condensable gases generated at 550°C contained the highest content of light hydrocarbons (C1C5), CO, CO2 and H2. Compared to raw sunflower oils, the properties of hydrocarbon fuels including the dynamic viscosity, pH, moisture content, density, oxygen content and heating value were improved.",

These substances are difficult to determine in environmental samples because of lack of appropriate analytical procedures. On the other hand they are suspected to influence the ecological equilibrium in aquatic ecosystems. Thus, studies on their fate in the environment, especially on the routes of their degradation seem to be of interest to both industrial and environmental chemistry.

However, features such as good stability to temperature, pH, ions and chemicals are required characteristics for industrial applications. This work aimed to provide a comparative biochemical analysis of three thermostable BGLs from Pyrococcus furiosus and Thermotoga petrophila. The genes PfBgl1 (GH1 from P. furiosus), TpBgl1 (GH1 from T. petrophila) and TpBgl3 (GH3 from T. petrophila) were cloned and proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified enzymes are hyperthermophilic, showing highest activity at temperatures above 80°C at acidic (TpBgl3 and PfBgl1) and neutral (TpBgl1) pHs. The BGLs showed greatest stability to temperature mainly at pH 6.0. Activities using a set of different substrates suggested that TpBgl3 (GH3) is more specific than GH1 family members. In addition, the influence of six monosaccharides on BGL catalysis was assayed. While PfBgl1 and TpBgl3 seemed to be weakly inhibited by monosaccharides, TpBgl1 was activated, with xylose showing the strongest activation. Under the conditions tested, TpBgl1 showed the highest inhibition constant (Ki = 1100.00 mM) when compared with several BGLs previously characterized. The BGLs studied have potential for industrial use, specifically the enzymes belonging to the GH1 family, due to its broad substrate specificity and weak inhibition by glucose and other saccharides.",

These isolates were subjected to characterisation and identification by MS MALDI-TOF of whole cells and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA genes. The isolates were screened by gas chromatography for their ability to degrade the selected pesticides. Some isolates were able to degrade pesticides, and the formation of degradation products (γ-pentachlorocyclohexane (γ-PCCH), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD)) observed in liquid culture confirmed their degradation capability. The isolates and DNA samples isolated from the contaminated soil were also screened for the bphA1 gene (encoding biphenyl-2,3-dioxygenase, the first enzyme in the PCB degradation pathway) and its occurrence was demonstrated. The isolates were also screened for the presence of linA, encoding dehydrochlorinase, the first enzyme of the HCH degradation pathway. The linA gene could not be found in any of the tested isolates, possibly due to the high specificity of the primers used. The isolates with the most effective degradation abilities could be used for further in situ bioremediation experiments with contaminated soil.",

The current study was focused on optimisation of tacrolimus biosynthesis by Streptomyces tsukubaensis through the use of culture media supplements. Enrichment of the fermentation medium with propionic acid, propylene glycol or propanol resulted in a 5.5-, 3.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, increase in tacrolimus production. The optimal concentration of the precursors was 0.25% for both propanol and propionic acid and 0.75% for propylene glycol. The mode of action of each media supplement tested was unique. For instance, propionic acid acted as a tacrolimus biosynthesis precursor while propylene glycol induced mycelial growth of S. tsukubaensis. Results from the current study clearly demonstrate that a set of novel culture medium supplements considerably increased tacrolimus production. Application of such promoters of tacrolimus biosynthesis may lead to a substantial improvement in the production of tacrolimus by S. tsukubaensis in industrial fermentation processes.",

Nowadays, fragrance encapsulation in biocompatible nanocontainer material is emerging as a novel strategy to overcome the evaporation of volatile molecules and to prolong the sensory characteristics of fragrance molecules and the longevity of perfumes. The objective of this study was to develop an innovative sustained release system of perfume, by entrapping fragrance molecules in a polymeric nanocarrier; the impact of this strategy on the human axillary microbiome was further assessed. Stabilised poly-l-lactic acid nanocapsules (PLA-NCs) with a diameter of approximately 115 nm were prepared through nanoprecipitation. Size and morphology of the capsules were evaluated using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Two model hydrophobic compounds, chlorobenzene and fluorescein, representing two different types of functionalised molecules, were encapsulated in PLA-NCs with an efficiency rate of 50%. Different release behaviours were seen, dependent on hydrophobicity. For hydrophobic compounds, a steady release was observed over 48 hours. The polymeric nanocarriers did not impact the human axillary microbiome. Because of the slow and sustained release of fragrances, encapsulation of molecules in biocompatible NCs can represent a revolutionary contribution to the future of toiletries, body deodorant products, and in washing and cleaning sectors.",

To achieve complete occupancy in co-crystallization experiments, the minimal requirement is one ligand for each of the two sites within the TTR tetramer. Here we present a new strategy for the co-crystallization of TTR using high molecular weight polyethylene glycol instead of high ionic strength precipitants, with ligands solubilized in multicomponent mixtures of compounds. This strategy is applied to the crystallization of TTR complexes with curcumin and 16α-bromo-estradiol.

     "abstract": "The use of genetically modified (GM) crops and their applications is partially suppressed in European Union (EU) agriculture, even if one would expect otherwise given their complementarity with the neoliberal and industrialised EU agricultural regime in place. By applying a qualitative content analysis, this paper analyses how food manufacturers and retailers (referred to as gatekeepers in the food industry) explain and defend the exclusion of GM-labelled food products on the EU market. The study design places emphasis on the role of perceptions in the strategic behaviour of gatekeepers and on the role of interaction in this regard, as we assume that the way in which gatekeepers perceive the ‘rules of the game’ for commercialising GM crop applications on the EU food market will be influenced by their interaction with other agribusiness actors.In a first stage, the analysis determines thematic congruence in the (types of) perceptions that explain an agribusiness actor's overall interpretation of the EU business environment for GM crop applications. This perceived ‘structuring arena’ (SA) for GM crop applications – as conceptualised within our framework – contains areas of either internal and external tensions, that have a compelling or non-committal influence on the agribusiness actor's interpretation. In a second stage, the analysis particularly defines how gatekeepers in the food industry perceive and experience the SA for GM crop applications on the EU market, and how these perceptual tensions subsequently influence their strategic behaviour for GM-labelled products on the EU market. Finally, we highlight how these perceptions and actions (or inaction) suppress the main changes in practice that are necessary to manage this wicked problem.",

Five fractions of extracellular and cell-wall polysaccharides were obtained by extraction, ethanol precipitation, and purification by ion-exchange, gel and affinity chromatography. The capacity of isolated polysaccharide fractions to induce innate inflammatory cytokines, and to modulate cytokine responses of activated lymphocytes was investigated. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were activated in vitro with polysaccharide fractions, in order to induce innate inflammatory cytokines: tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL) 12 and interferon gamma (IFN-γ). For the immunomodulation capacity, polysaccharide fractions were cultured with ionomycine and phorbol myristate acetate (IONO + PMA) activated PBMC, and the concentrations of induced IL-2, IL-4, IFN-γ, IL-10 and IL-17 were measured. The results showed that polysaccharides from G. lucidum induced moderate to high amounts of innate inflammatory cytokines. Fungal cell-wall polysaccharides were stronger innate inflammatory cytokines inducers, while extracellular polysaccharides demonstrated a higher capacity to modulate cytokine responses of IONO + PMA induced production of IL-17. The results indicate that G. lucidum polysaccharides enhance Th1 response with high levels of IFN-γ and IL-2, and display low to no impact on IL-4 production. A similar pattern was observed at regulatory cytokine IL-10. All of the polysaccharide fractions tested induced IL-17 production at different concentration levels.",

     "abstract": "This review aims to explore the needs and opportunities of research & development in the field of biowaste biorefinery in Europe. Modern industry in recent years is giving its close attention on organic waste as a new precious bioresource. Specific biowaste valorisation pathways are focusing on food processing waste, being food sector the first manufacture in Europe. Anyway they need to be further tested and validated and then transferred at the larger scale. In particular, they also need to become integrated, combining biomass pretreatments and recovery of biogenic chemicals with bioconversion processes in order to obtain a large class of chemicals. This will help to (a) use the whole biowaste, by avoiding producing residues and providing to the approach the required environmental sustainability, and (b) producing different biobased products that enter different markets, to get the possible economical sustainability of the whole biorefinery. However, the costs of the developed integrated processes might be high, mostly for the fact that the industry dealing with such issues is still underdeveloped and therefore dominated by high processing costs. Such costs can be significantly reduced by intensifying research & development on process integration and intensification. The low or no cost of starting material along with the environmental benefits coming from the concomitant biowaste disposal would offset the high capital costs for initiating such a biorefinery. As long as the oil prices tend to increase (and they will) this strategy will become even more attractive.",

     "abstract": "The growing concern for the increase of the global warming effects due to anthropogenic activities raises the challenge of finding novel technological approaches to stabilize CO2 emissions in the atmosphere and counteract impinging interconnected issues such as desertification and loss of biodiversity. Biological-CO2 mitigation, triggered through biological fixation, is considered a promising and eco-sustainable method, mostly owing to its downstream benefits that can be exploited. Microorganisms such as cyanobacteria, green algae and some autotrophic bacteria could potentially fix CO2 more efficiently than higher plants, due to their faster growth. Some examples of the potential of biological-CO2 mitigation are reported and discussed in this paper.In arid and semiarid environments, soil carbon sequestration (CO2 fixation) by cyanobacteria and biological soil crusts is considered an eco-friendly and natural process to increase soil C content and a viable pathway to soil restoration after one disturbance event. Another way for biological-CO2 mitigation intensively studied in the last few years is related to the possibility to perform carbon dioxide sequestration using microalgae, obtaining at the same time bioproducts of industrial interest. Another possibility under study is the exploitation of specific chemotrophic bacteria, such as Ralstonia eutropha (or picketii) and related organisms, for CO2 fixation coupled with the production chemicals such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs).In spite of the potential of these processes, multiple factors still have to be optimized for maximum rate of CO2 fixation by these microorganisms. The optimization of culture conditions, including the optimal concentration of CO2 in the provided gas, the use of metabolic engineering and of dual purpose systems for the treatment of wastewater and production of biofuels and high value products within a biorefinery concept, the design of photobioreactors in the case of phototrophs are some of the issues that, among others, have to be addressed and tested for cost-effective CO2 sequestration.",

To tackle the supply risk challenge, innovation is required with respect to sustainable primary mining, substitution of critical metals, and urban mining. In these three categories, biometallurgy can play a crucial role. Indeed, microbe–metal interactions have been successfully applied on full scale to win materials from primary sources, but are not sufficiently explored for metal recovery or recycling. On the one hand, this article gives an overview of the microbial strategies that are currently applied on full scale for biomining; on the other hand it identifies technologies, currently developed in the laboratory, which have a perspective for large scale metal recovery and the needs and challenges on which bio-metallurgical research should focus to achieve this ambitious goal.",

     "abstract": "This paper contains a critical examination of the current application of environmental biotechnologies in the field of bioremediation of contaminated groundwater and sediments. Based on analysis of conventional technologies applied in several European Countries and in the US, scientific, technical and administrative barriers and constraints which still need to be overcome for an improved exploitation of bioremediation are discussed. From this general survey, it is evident that in situ bioremediation is a highly promising and cost-effective technology for remediation of contaminated soil, groundwater and sediments. The wide metabolic diversity of microorganisms makes it applicable to an ever-increasing number of contaminants and contamination scenarios. On the other hand, in situ bioremediation is highly knowledge-intensive and its application requires a thorough understanding of the geochemistry, hydrogeology, microbiology and ecology of contaminated soils, groundwater and sediments, under both natural and engineered conditions. Hence, its potential still remains partially unexploited, largely because of a lack of general consensus and public concerns regarding the lack of effectiveness and control, poor reliability, and possible occurrence of side effects, for example accumulation of toxic metabolites and pathogens. Basic, applied and pre-normative research are all needed to overcome these barriers and make in situ bioremediation more reliable, robust and acceptable to the public, as well as economically more competitive. Research efforts should not be restricted to a deeper understanding of relevant microbial reactions, but also include their interactions with the large array of other relevant phenomena, as a function of the truly variable site-specific conditions. There is a need for a further development and application of advanced biomolecular tools for site investigation, as well as of advanced metabolic and kinetic modelling tools. These would allow a quicker evaluation of the bioremediation potential of a site, and in turn a preliminary assessment of the technical feasibility of the chosen bioprocess which could replace or at least reduce the need for time-consuming and expensive field tests. At the same time, field tests will probably remain unavoidable for a detailed design of full scale remedial actions and the above reported tools will in any event be useful for a better design and a more reliable operation.",

     "abstract": "Emerging pollutants reach the environment from various anthropogenic sources and are distributed throughout environmental matrices. Although great advances have been made in the detection and analysis of trace pollutants during recent decades, due to the continued development and refinement of specific techniques, a wide array of undetected contaminants of emerging environmental concern need to be identified and quantified in various environmental components and biological tissues. These pollutants may be mobile and persistent in air, water, soil, sediments and ecological receptors even at low concentrations. Robust data on their fate and behaviour in the environment, as well as on threats to ecological and human health, are still lacking. Moreover, the ecotoxicological significance of some emerging micropollutants remains largely unknown, because satisfactory data to determine their risk often do not exist.This paper discusses the fate, behaviour, (bio)monitoring, environmental and health risks associated with emerging chemical (pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, hormones, toxins, among others) and biological (bacteria, viruses) micropollutants in soils, sediments, groundwater, industrial and municipal wastewaters, aquaculture effluents, and freshwater and marine ecosystems, and highlights new horizons for their (bio)removal. Our study aims to demonstrate the imperative need to boost research and innovation for new and cost-effective treatment technologies, in line with the uptake, mode of action and consequences of each emerging contaminant. We also address the topic of innovative tools for the evaluation of the effects of toxicity on human health and for the prediction of microbial availability and degradation in the environment. Additionally, we consider the development of (bio)sensors to perform environmental monitoring in real-time mode. This needs to address multiple species, along with a more effective exploitation of specialised microbes or enzymes capable of degrading endocrine disruptors and other micropollutants. In practical terms, the outcomes of these activities will build up the knowledge base and develop solutions to fill the significant innovation gap faced worldwide.",

     "abstract": "Human histocompatibility antigens are quite heterogeneous and promote the rejection of transplanted tissue. Recent advances in stem cell research that enable the use of a patient's own stem cells for transplantation are very important because rejection could be avoided. In particular, Yamanaka's group in Japan gave new hope to patients with incurable diseases when they developed induced murine pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in 2006 and human iPSCs in 2007. Whereas embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from the inner cell mass and are supported in culture by LIF, iPSCs are derived from fetal or adult somatic cells. Through the application of iPSC technology, adult somatic cells can develop a pluripotent state. One advantage of using iPSCs instead of ESCs in regenerative medicine is that (theoretically) immune rejection could be avoided, although there is some debate about immune rejection of a patient's own iPSCs. Many diseases occur in elderly patients. In order to use regenerative medicine with the elderly, it is important to demonstrate that iPSCs can indeed be generated from older patients. Recent findings have shown that iPSCs can be established from aged mice and aged humans. These iPSCs can differentiate to cells from all three germ layers. However, it is not known whether iPSCs from aged mice or humans show early senescence. Before clinical use of iPSCs, issues related to copy number variation, tumorigenicity and immunogenicity must be resolved. It is particularly important that researchers have succeeded in generating iPSCs that have differentiated to somatic cells related to specific diseases of the elderly, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. These efforts will facilitate the use of personalized stem cell transplantation therapy for currently incurable diseases.",

     "abstract": "Most clinical applications of human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for cell therapy, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and treatment of immune and inflammatory diseases require a phase of isolation and ex vivo expansion allowing a clinically meaningful cell number to be reached. Conditions used for cell isolation and expansion should meet strict quality and safety requirements. This is particularly true for the growth medium used for MSC isolation and expansion. Basal growth media used for MSC expansion are supplemented with multiple nutrients and growth factors. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) has long been the gold standard medium supplement for laboratory-scale MSC culture. However, FBS has a poorly characterized composition and poses risk factors, as it may be a source of xenogenic antigens and zoonotic infections. FBS has therefore become undesirable as a growth medium supplement for isolating and expanding MSCs for human therapy protocols. In recent years, human blood materials, and most particularly lysates and releasates of platelet concentrates have emerged as efficient medium supplements for isolating and expanding MSCs from various origins. This review analyzes the advantages and limits of using human platelet materials as medium supplements for MSC isolation and expansion. We present the modes of production of allogeneic and autologous platelet concentrates, measures taken to ensure optimal pathogen safety profiles, and methods of preparing PLs for MSC expansion. We also discuss the supply of such blood preparations. Produced under optimal conditions of standardization and safety, human platelet materials can become the future ‘gold standard’ supplement for ex vivo production of MSCs for translational medicine and cell therapy applications.",

     "abstract": "N-linked glycosylation of proteins is one of the most common posttranslational modifications. N-glycan structures and N-glycosylation efficiency are crucial parameters in the production of N-glycosylated proteins. Yeast cells can be seen as an attractive production host for therapeutic glycoproteins and pioneering work of glycoengineering was performed in Pichia pastoris, realizing yeast strains capable of producing defined, human-type N-glycans.Most strategies used for glycoengineering rely on the modification of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis for the generation of the substrate for Golgi-localized glycosyltransferases. However, modifications in the lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis often result in the accumulation of intermediate structures and cause hypoglycosylation of client proteins. In order to ensure complete N-glycosylation, the flow of lipid-linked oligosaccharide through the biosynthetic pathway and the transfer of the oligosaccharide from the donor lipid onto the protein have to be optimized. A promising tool to improve site occupancy is the expression of protozoan oligosaccharyltransferases, which possess altered specificities for the oligosaccharide and also for the protein acceptor site. Furthermore, flipping of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide into the ER lumen can be improved by overexpression of an artificial flippase. Improving the glycosylation efficiency ensures that not only homogeneous N-glycan structures are generated, but also client proteins are fully glycosylated.",

However, due to their complexity, efficient expression remains a bottleneck for high level production. In recent years, the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris has emerged as one of the most commonly used expression systems for membrane protein production.Here, we have analysed the transcriptomes of P. pastoris strains producing different classes of membrane proteins (mitochondrial, ER/Golgi and plasma membrane localized) to understand the cellular response and to identify targets to engineer P. pastoris towards an improved chassis for membrane protein production.Microarray experiments revealed varying transcriptional responses depending on the enzymatic activity, subcellular localization and physiological role of the membrane proteins. While an alternative oxidase evoked primarily a response within the mitochondria, the overexpression of transporters entering the secretory pathway had a wide effect on lipid metabolism and induced the upregulation of the UPR (unfolded protein response) transcription factor Hac1p. Coexpression of P. pastoris endogenous HAC1 increased the levels of ER-resident membrane proteins 1.5- to 2.1-fold. Subsequent transcriptome analysis of HAC1 coexpression revealed an upregulation of the folding machinery correlating with an expansion of the ER membrane capacity, thus boosting membrane protein production. Hence, our study has helped to elucidate the cellular response of P. pastoris to the expression of different classes of membrane proteins and led specifically to new insights into the effect of PpHac1p on membrane proteins entering the secretory pathway.",

     "abstract": "Bacillus megaterium is a bacterium that has been used in the past for the industrial production of vitamin B12 (cobalamin), the anti-pernicious anaemia factor. Cobalamin is a modified tetrapyrrole with a cobalt ion coordinated within its macrocycle. More recently, B. megaterium has been developed as a host for the high-yield production of recombinant proteins using a xylose inducible promoter system. Herein, we revisit cobalamin production in B. megaterium DSM319. We have investigated the importance of cobalt for optimum growth and cobalamin production. The cobaltochelatase (CbiXL) is encoded within a 14-gene cobalamin biosynthetic (cbi) operon, whose gene-products oversee the transformation of uroporphyrinogen III into adenosylcobyrinic acid a,c-diamide, a key precursor of cobalamin synthesis. The production of CbiXL in response to exogenous cobalt was monitored. The metal was found to stimulate cobalamin biosynthesis and decrease the levels of CbiXL. From this we were able to show that the entire cbi operon is transcriptionally regulated by a B12-riboswitch, with a switch-off point at approximately 5 nM cobalamin. To bypass the effects of the B12-riboswitch the cbi operon was cloned without these regulatory elements. Growth of these strains on minimal media supplemented with glycerol as a carbon source resulted in significant increases in cobalamin production (up to 200 μg L−1). In addition, a range of partially amidated intermediates up to adenosylcobyric acid was detected. These findings outline a potential way to develop B. megaterium as a cell factory for cobalamin production using cheap raw materials.",

The microorganisms that are easiest to genetically manipulate for these endeavors (e.g. Escherichia coli) are often afflicted by an undesirable sensitivity to the very product that they are engineered to synthesize. In this context, we have examined the resistance to the stress arising from ethanol synthesis and/or its addition to cultures of recombinant Pseudomonas putida, using as a benchmark the same trait in an E. coli strain. To this end, ethanologenic strains of these two species were constructed by functionally expressing pdc (pyruvate decarboxylase) and adhB (alcohol dehydrogenase) from Zymomonas mobilis. Recombinants were compared under anoxic conditions as ethanol producers, and cell survival, stress resistance, and phenotypic stability were quantified in each case. P. putida consistently outperformed E. coli in every ethanol tolerance test conducted – whether the alcohol was produced endogenously or added exogenously. These results highlight the value of this bacterium as a microbial cell factory for the production of biofuels owing to its naturally pre-evolved ability to withstand different kinds of chemical stresses.",

Their small size allows for more points of contact than would be the case with a similar bulk compound, making nanoparticles excellent candidates for catalysts or for when increased levels of binding are required. Some nanoparticles have unique optical qualities, making them well suited as sensors, while others display para-magnetism, useful in medical imaging, especially by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Many of these metallic nanoparticles could be used in creating tools for synthetic biology, and conversely the use of synthetic biology could itself be utilised to create nanoparticle tools. Examples given here include the potential use of quantum dots (QDs) and gold nanoparticles as sensing mechanisms in synthetic biology, and the use of synthetic biology to create nanoparticle-sensing devices based on current methods of detecting metals and metalloids such as arsenate. There are a number of organisms which are able to produce a range of metallic nanoparticles naturally, such as species of the fungus Phoma which produces anti-microbial silver nanoparticles. The biological synthesis of nanoparticles may have many advantages over their more traditional industrial synthesis.

Over the last decade, with the development of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, more and more bioactive natural products including NRPs and PKs have been heterologously produced using easy-to-handle surrogate microbes. In this process, the full biosynthetic pathway for the production of a target compound is first identified and isolated from the native producer, and then reconstituted in a well-characterized and easily culturable heterologous producer like Escherichia coli. Thereafter, the productivity could be rationally improved through multiple strategies from strain to bioprocess optimization.

The chemical characterization of the lipidic fractions was performed by gas-chromatography and multinuclear and multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. In the lipidic extract of C. rupestris collected in January an antibacterial activity against Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus agalactiae and Vibrio cholerae non-O1 was recorded; by contrast, bacterial inhibition was measured on several Vibrio species only in April. The fatty acid profile of C. rupestris lipidic extract, analyzed by gas chromatography, resulted mainly composed of palmitic, myristic, oleic, α linolenic, palmitoleic and linoleic acids. Moreover, since α-linolenic acid was the predominant ω3 fatty acid in April, we suggest its involvement in the antibacterial activity observed in this month, taking also into account that pure α-linolenic acid resulted effective towards some vibrios strains. C. rupestris fatty acid profile revealed also an interesting composition in polyunsaturated fatty acids in both the considered periods with the ω6/ω3 ratio lower than 1, leading to conclude that this macroalga may be employed as a natural source of ω3. Finally, the 1H NMR spectrum in CDCl3 of algal lipid fractions showed the characteristic signals of saturated (SAFAs) and unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) as well as other metabolites and a marked difference in free fatty acids (FFAs) content for the two examined algal lipid fractions. It is noteworthy that C. rupestris lipidic extracts show, by NMR spectroscopy, the signal pattern of polyhydroxybutyrate, a natural biocompatible and biodegradable polymer. In conclusion, on account of its antimicrobial activity, nutritional value and bioplastic content, C. rupestris lipidic extract can be considered a promising source for future biotechnological applications.",

     "abstract": "Fermentative production of bio-hydrogen (bio-H2) from organic residues has emerged as a promising alternative for providing the required electron source for hydrogen driven remediation strategies. Unlike the widely used production of H2 by bacteria in fresh water systems, few reports are available regarding the generation of biogenic H2 and optimisation processes in marine systems. The present research aims to optimise the capability of an indigenous marine bacterium for the production of bio-H2 in marine environments and subsequently develop this process for hydrogen driven remediation strategies. Fermentative conversion of organics in marine media to H2 using a marine isolate, Pseudoalteromonas sp. BH11, was determined. A Taguchi design of experimental methodology was employed to evaluate the optimal nutritional composition in batch tests to improve bio-H2 yields. Further optimisation experiments showed that alginate-immobilised bacterial cells were able to produce bio-H2 at the same rate as suspended cells over a period of several weeks. Finally, bio-H2 was used as electron donor to successfully dehalogenate trichloroethylene (TCE) using biogenic palladium nanoparticles as a catalyst. Fermentative production of bio-H2 can be a promising technique for concomitant generation of an electron source for hydrogen driven remediation strategies and treatment of organic residue in marine ecosystems.",

     "abstract": "Microorganisms play a significant role in bioethanol production from lignocellulosic material. A challenging problem in bioconversion of rice bran is the presence of toxic inhibitors in lignocellulosic acid hydrolysate. Various strains of Zymomonas mobilis (ZM4, TISTR 405, 548, 550 and 551) grown under biofilm or planktonic modes were used in this study to examine their potential for bioconversion of rice bran hydrolysate and ethanol production efficiencies. Z. mobilis readily formed bacterial attachment on plastic surfaces, but not on glass surfaces. Additionally, the biofilms formed on plastic surfaces steadily increased over time, while those formed on glass were speculated to cycle through accumulation and detachment phases. Microscopic analysis revealed that Z. mobilis ZM4 rapidly developed homogeneous biofilm structures within 24 hours, while other Z. mobilis strains developed heterogeneous biofilm structures. ZM4 biofilms were thicker and seemed to be more stable than other Z. mobilis strains. The percentage of live cells in biofilms was greater than that for planktonic cells (54.32 ± 7.10% vs. 28.69 ± 3.03%), suggesting that biofilms serve as a protective niche for growth of bacteria in the presence of toxic inhibitors in the rice bran hydrolysate. The metabolic activity of ZM4 grown as a biofilm was also higher than the same strain grown planktonically, as measured by ethanol production from rice bran hydrolysate (13.40 ± 2.43 g/L vs. 0.432 ± 0.29 g/L, with percent theoretical ethanol yields of 72.47 ± 6.13% and 3.71 ± 5.24% respectively). Strain TISTR 551 was also quite metabolically active, with ethanol production by biofilm and planktonically grown cells of 8.956 ± 4.06 g/L and 0.0846 ± 0.064 g/L (percent theoretical yields were 48.37 ± 16.64% and 2.046 ± 1.58%, respectively).

Superficial liquid velocities of 0.19 m s−1, 0.37 m s−1, 0.55 m s−1 and 3.65 m s−1 were used. The highest velocity resulted in negligible cell attachment (chemostat) while the ratio of attached-to-total cell mass escalated as the superficial velocity decreased. The lactic acid yield on glucose increased from 0.75 g g−1 to 0.90 g g−1 with declining shear while the corresponding acetoin yield on glucose decreased from 0.074 g g−1 to 0.017 g g−1. Redox analysis of the catabolites revealed a net consumption of NADH in the anabolism, while the extent of NADH consumption decreased when shear was reduced. This was attributed to the formation of more extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) at low shear conditions. A simplified metabolic flux model was used to estimate the EPS content of the biomass as a function of the shear velocity. Rate data supported the notion of increased EPS at lower shear.",

Under steady-state conditions, when Hytrel G3548L (5%) was added to the CSTB, the maximum elimination capacity (ECmax) achieved was ∼60 g m−3 h−1, which was similar as in the absence of the NAP.

Furthermore a full necropsy was performed at 12 months post-treatment. The intra-articular injection of autologous MSC was safe, as judged by the lack of local or systemic adverse effects during the clinical follow-up and by a full necropsy performed at 12 months post-treatment.

Optimization of combined transcription and translation (Tx/Tl) CFPS reactions primed with linear DNA containing the CrPV IGR IRES resulted in batch synthesis yields of 0.92 ± 0.17 μg/mL luciferase. Further template engineering, such as including the first 12 nt of native CrPV gene, increased yields to 2.33 ± 0.11 μg/mL.

Thus, from a bioprocessing point of view, understanding its molecular mechanisms may provide potential avenues for improving cell culture performance. Toward this end, the mTOR pathway of CHO cells in batch cultures was subjected to rapamycin treatment (inhibition) or nutrient supplementation (induction) and translational activities of CHO cells producing a monoclonal antibody (mAb) were evaluated with polysome profiling technology. Expectedly, rapamycin induced a shift of mRNAs from polysomes towards monosomes, thus reducing maximum cellular growth rate by 30%, while feeding additional nutrients extended mTOR pathway activity during the stationary growth phase in control batch culture, thereby contributing to an increase in global translation activity by up to 2-fold, and up to 5-fold higher specific translation of the heavy and light chains of the recombinant mAb. These increases in translation activity correlated with a 5-day extension in cellular growth and a 4-fold higher final product titer observed upon nutrient feeding. This first study of the relationship between the mTOR pathway and translational activity in CHO cultures provides key insights into the role of translational control in supporting greater productivity, which will lead to further enhancement of CHO cultures.",

     "abstract": "Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are polyesters that can be produced from industrial wastewater or surplus products by mixed microbial cultures (MMC). To optimise PHA production by MMCs, the link between the microbial structure and function of these enrichments must be better established. This study investigates, for the first time, the impact of operational changes on the microbial community and the associated process performance of PHA producing MMCs. It was found that a PHA producing community fed with fermented molasses was dominated by a combination of Azoarcus, Thauera and Paracoccus, where the former two groups were present in highest abundance. Dominance of either Thauera or Azoarcus seemed to be determined by the organic loading rate imposed in the selection reactor. While higher Azoarcus enrichments led to higher PHA production yields and lower biomass growth yields as compared to Thauera, the Thauera abundance was strongly linked to higher hydroxyvalerate (HV) fractions. Paracoccus abundance was correlated with a lower PHA production capacity as compared to Azoarcus, and produced lower HV fractions than Thauera and Azoarcus. The findings of this study suggest that MMCs targeting the enrichment of Azoarcus as the primary biomass fraction with Thauera as a minor fraction lead to optimal specific PHA production and polymers with high HV content, which is likely to improve their mechanical properties.",

The effect of the feeding time was only evaluated with a cycle length of 8 h; for this particular cycle length, an increase in the storage response was observed by increasing the rate at which the substrate was fed into the reactor (at a fixed feeding frequency). Furthermore, a significantly stronger effect was observed by decreasing the cycle length from 8 h to 6 h and then to 2 h, changing the feed frequency or changing the organic load given per cycle (all of the other conditions remained the same): the length of the feast phase decreased from 26 to 20.0 and then to 19.7% of the overall cycle length, respectively, due to an increase in the substrate removal rate. This removal rate was high and similar for the runs with cycle lengths of 2 h and 6 h in the SBR. This result was due to an increase in the selective pressure and the specific storage properties of the selected biomass. The highest polymer productivity after long-term accumulation batch tests was 1.7 g PHA L−1 d−1, with PHA content in the biomass of approximately 50% on a COD basis under nitrogen limitation.

The acidogenic stage responded immediately to the feedstock shift by changing the fermented products profile, with acetate and butyrate being the main acids produced from CW, while for SCM propionate and valerate were the dominant products. The fermentation process was then quite stable during long term operation. The PHA culture selection stage also responded quickly to the fermented feestocks shift, generating a polymer whose composition was linearly dependent on the concentration of HV and HB precursors produced in the acidogenic stage. The selected culture reached a maximum PHA content of 56% and 65% with fermented SCM and CW, respectively. Mixing fermented CW and SCM, in equal volume proportions, demonstrated the possibility of using different fermented feedstocks for tailoring polymer composition.",

The impact of the complex bio-oil matrix on PHA production by an enriched mixed culture was examined. The performance of the direct utilization of pure bio-oil was compared with the utilization of three defined substrates contained in this bio-oil: acetate, glucose and xylose. When compared with acetate, bio-oil revealed lower capacity for polymer production as a result of a lower polymer yield on substrate and a lower PHA cell content. Two strategies for bio-oil upgrade were performed, anaerobic fermentation and vacuum distillation, and the resulting liquid streams were tested for polymer production. The first one was enriched in volatile fatty acids and the second one mainly on phenolic and long-chain fatty acids. PHA accumulation assays using the upgraded bio-oils attained polymer yields on substrate similar or higher than the one achieved with acetate, although with a lower PHA content. The capacity to use the enriched fractions for polymer production has yet to be optimized. The anaerobic digestion of bio-oil could also open-up the possibility to use the fermented bio-oil directly in the enrichment process of the mixed culture.

The motivation for the study was to examine integration of PHA production into the water treatment and residuals management needs at the Suiker Unie sugar beet factory in Groningen, the Netherlands. At the factory, process waters are treated in nitrifying–denitrifying sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) to remove nitrogen found in condensate. Organic slippage (COD) in waters coming from beet washing is the substrate used for denitrification. The full-scale SBR was mimicked at laboratory scale. In two parallel laboratory scale SBRs, a mixed-culture biomass selection strategy of anoxic-feast and aerobic-famine was investigated using the condensate and wash water from Suiker Unie. One laboratory SBR was operated as conventional activated sludge with long solids retention time similar to the full-scale (SRT >16 days) while the other SBR was a hybrid biofilm-activated sludge (IFAS) process with short SRT (4–6 days) for the suspended solids. Both SBRs were found to produce biomass with augmented PHA production potential while sustaining process water treatment for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus for the factory process waters. PHA producing potential in excess of 60 percent g-PHA/g-VSS was achieved with the lab scale surplus biomass. Surplus biomass of low (4–6 days) and high (>16 days) solids retention time yielded similar results in PHA accumulation potential. However, nitrification performance was found to be more robust for the IFAS SBR. Assessment of the SBR microbial ecology based on 16sDNA and selected PHA synthase genes at full-scale in comparison to biomass from the laboratory scale SBRs suggested that the full-scale process was enriched with a PHA storing microbial community. However, structure–function relationships based on RNA levels for the selected PHA synthases could not be established and, towards this ambition, it is speculated that a wider representation of PHA synthesases would need to be monitored. Additionally at the factory, beet tail press waters coming from the factory beet residuals management activities are available as a carbon source for PHA accumulation. At pilot scale, beet tail press waters were shown to provide a suitable carbon source for mixed culture PHA production in spite of otherwise being of relatively low organic strength (≤10 g-COD/L). A copolymer of 3-hydroxybutyrate with 3-hydroxyvalerate (PHBV with 15% HV on a molar basis) of high thermal stability and high weight average molecular mass (980 kDa) was produced from the beet tail press water. The mixed culture accumulation process sustained PHA storage with parallel biomass growth of PHA storing bacteria suggesting a strategy to further leverage the utilization of surplus functional biomass from biological treatment systems. Integration of PHA production into the existing factory water management by using surplus biomass from condensate water treatment and press waters from beet residuals processing was found to be a feasible strategy for biopolymer production.",

The model was able to capture the process dynamics denoted by an excellent fit between experimental and computed time profiles of concentrations with the regression coefficients always above 0.92. The introduced VFA uptake regulatory factor reflects the decrease of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA available to TCA cycle in conformity with the hypothesis that the minimization of TCA cycle is a key metabolic objective for MMC subjected to feast and famine regimen for the maximization of PHA production.",

Feeding was performed in such a way as to produce materials with a wide range of monomer compositions and microstructures. Solvent-cast thin films of these materials have recently been shown to exhibit a narrow range of mechanical properties similar to those of the homopolymer poly(R-3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) [1]. In this work, more detailed analyses of the thermal and crystallisation properties of these mixed-culture polyesters have revealed that they like comprise complex blends with broad compositional distribution of random and/or blocky copolymers of very different 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) contents and melting temperatures and thus have very different respective crystallisation kinetics. This blend complexity was confirmed by solvent fractionation of selected samples. The findings support the hypothesis that overall mechanical properties of these complex copolymer blend materials will be strongly influenced by the more rapidly crystallising components that form the matrix within which the slower crystallising components exist as microdomains. New opportunities in the material development of PHAs are likely to be found in establishing and exploiting such structure–function relationships.",

     "abstract": "Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolymer processing is often challenged by low thermal stability, meaning that the temperatures and time for which these polymers can be processed is restrictive. Considering the sensitivity of PHA to processing conditions, there is a demand for in-line monitoring of the material behaviour in the melt. This paper investigates the application of Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for monitoring the thermal degradation of PHAs during melt-processing. Two types of materials were tested: two mixed culture PHAs extracted from biomass produced in laboratory and pilot scale after an acidic pre-treatment, and two commercially available materials derived from pure culture production systems. Thermal degradation studies were carried out in a laboratory scale extruder with conical twin screws connected to a NIR spectrometer by a fibre optic to allow in situ monitoring. Multivariate data analysis methods were applied for assessing thermal degradation kinetics and predicted the degree of degradation as measured by 1H NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy). The pre-treated mixed culture PHAs were found to be more thermally stable when compared with the commercial pure culture PHAs as demonstrated by NIR, 1H NMR and GPC (gel permeation chromatography).",

The characterization of the pure biopolyesters showed that the properties of PHAs may be strongly modified by varying the valerate ratio in the poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) copolymer, as expected. Increasing the valerate content was seen to greatly decrease the melting temperature and enthalpy of the material, as well as its rigidity and stiffness, resulting in a more ductile behaviour. Additionally, the higher valerate PHA displayed higher permeability to water and oxygen and higher moisture sensitivity. Subsequently, BCNW were incorporated into both PHA grades, achieving a high level of dispersion for a 1 wt.-% loading, whereas some agglomeration took place for 3 wt.-% BCNW. As evidenced by DSC analyses, BCNW presented a nucleating effect on the PHA matrices. BCNW also increased the thermal stability of the polymeric matrices when properly dispersed due to strong matrix–filler interactions. Barrier properties were seen to depend on relative humidity and improved at low nanofiller loadings and low relative humidity.",

     "abstract": "Assessing the environmental performance of emerging technologies using life cycle assessment (LCA) can be challenging due to a lack of data in relation to technologies, application areas or other life cycle considerations, or a lack of LCA methodology that address the specific concerns. Nevertheless, LCA can be a valuable tool in the environmental optimisation in the technology development phase. One emerging technology is the mixed-culture production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). PHA production by pure microbial cultures has been developed and assessed in several LCAs during the previous decade. Recent developments within mixed-culture PHA production call for environmental assessment to guide in technology development. Mixed-culture PHA production can use the organic content in wastewater as a feedstock; the production may then be integrated with wastewater treatment (WWT) processes. This means that mixed-culture PHA is produced as a by-product from services in the WWT.This article explores different methodological challenges for LCA of mixed-culture PHA production using organic material in wastewater as feedstock.LCAs of both pure- and mixed-culture PHA production were reviewed. Challenges, similarities and differences when assessing PHA production by mixed- or pure-cultures were identified and the resulting implications for methodological choices in LCA were evaluated and illustrated, using a case study with mixed- and pure-culture PHA model production systems, based on literature data.Environmental impacts of processes producing multiple products or services need to be allocated between the different products or services. Such situations occur both in feedstock production and when the studied system is providing multiple functions. The selection of allocation method is shown to determine the LCA results. The type of data used, for electricity in the energy system, is shown to be important for the results, which indicates, a strong regional dependency of results for systems with electricity use as an environmental hot spot. The importance of assessing water use, an environmental impact not assessed by any of the reviewed studies, is highlighted.",

Successful synthesis of RGD peptide as well as the chemical structure of POSS-PCL nanocomposite film was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Cell viability assay and morphological assessment were performed to investigate the cytocompatibility of the fabricated constructs. Successful immobilisation of RGD peptide onto the nanocomposite surface was confirmed by water contact angle, Brilliant Blue (BB) staining and thin layer chromatography. Both POSS-PCL and RGD-POSS-PCL nanocomposite scaffolds supported SC attachment, proliferation and morphological differentiation, important aspects for peripheral nerve regeneration. However, a significant increase in SC process length and morphological differentiation towards maturation was observed on the cells grown on RGD-POSS-PCL film. RGD-POSS-PCL nanocomposite demonstrated a significant improvement in SCs spreading and its integrin-dependent process outgrowth (P < 0.05).Conduits made by POSS-nanocomposite may be suitable for the next generation of commercially available conduit required to meet current clinical demand in peripheral nerve regeneration and repair as they are currently undergoing in vivo preclinical study.",

In this study we have used high-throughput robotic clone selection in combination with UCOE™ containing expression vectors to develop a rapid, streamlined approach for early-stage cell line development and isolation of high-expressing clones for mAb production using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to go from transfection to stable clones in only 4 weeks, while achieving specific productivities exceeding 20 pg/cell/day. Furthermore, we have used this approach to quickly screen several process-crucial parameters including IgG subtype, enhancer-promoter combination and UCOE™ length.

In this study, we isolated the Klebsiella variicola TB-83 strain, which demonstrated maximum ethanol productivity at alkaline pH. Strain TB-83 showed effective usage of crude glycerol with maximum ethanol production at pH 8.0–9.0, and the culture pH was finally neutralized by formate, a by-product.

Strain TB-83 produced 9.8 g/L ethanol (0.86 mol/mol glycerol) from cooking oil-derived BDF waste.

In this study, bioresponsive polymer (BRP) systems were used for the detection of microorganisms in PCs. The backbone of the polymer consisted of labelled protein (casein), which was demonstrated to be degraded by pure proteases as models and by extracellular enzymes released by contaminating microorganisms. The concomitant colour change was easily visible to the naked eye. To enhance stability, the protein was cross-linked with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA). The cross-linked polymer was easier to handle but was less sensitive than the non-cross-linked material. A contamination of a PC with 10 CFU/mL S. aureus was detectable after 24 hours. The visible colour reaction was quantified as a ΔE value according to the CIELab concept. A ΔE value of 21.8 was already reached after 24 hours.

We show that using a ‘thick tailed’ power law distribution to describe the behavior of the value of biotechnology R&D used in a Real Options Pricing model is significantly more accurate than the traditionally used Gaussian approach. A study of 287 North-American biotechnology firms gives insights into common problems faced by investors, managers and other stakeholders when using traditional techniques to calculate the commercial value of R&D. This is important because specific quantitative tools to assess the value of high-risk, high-reward R&D do not currently exist. This often leads to an undervaluation of biotechnology R&D and R&D intensive biotechnology firms. For example, the widely used Net Present Value (NPV) method assumes a fixed risk ignoring management flexibility and the changing environment. However, Real Options Pricing models assume that commercial returns from R&D investments are described by a normal random walk. A normal random walk model eliminates the possibility of drastic changes to the marketplace resulting from the introduction of revolutionary products and/or services. It is possible to better understand and manage biotechnology research projects and portfolios using a model that more accurately considers large non-Gaussian price fluctuations with thick tails, which recognize the unusually large risks and opportunities associated with Biotechnology R&D. Our empirical data show that opportunity overcompensates for the downside risk making biotechnology R&D statistically more valuable than other Gaussian options investments, which may otherwise appear to offer a similar combination of risk and return.",

This paper describes the conversion of steam-pretreated corn stover to ethanol utilising a multi-step process including enzymatic hydrolysis, isomerisation, and fermentation of mixed hydrolysates with native Saccharomyces cerevisiae. An immobilised isomerase enzyme was used for the xylose isomerisation along with high concentrations of S. cerevisiae. The objective was to assess the extent of simultaneity of the various conversion steps, through a detailed analysis of process time courses, and to test this process scheme for the conversion of lignocellulosic hydrolysates containing several inhibitors of the isomerase enzyme (e.g. metal ions, xylitol and glycerol).The process was tested on two types of hydrolysate after acid-catalysed steam pretreatment: (a) the water soluble fraction (WSF) in which xylose was the largest carbon source and (b) the entire slurry, containing both cellulose and hemicellulose carbohydrates, in which glucose predominated.The results indicated that the ethanol concentration rose when the inoculum concentration was increased in the range 10–75 g/L. However, when xylose was the largest carbon source, the metabolic yields were higher than 0.51 gethanol/gconsumed sugars probably due to the use of yeast internal cellular resources. This phenomenon was not observed in the fermentation of mixed hydrolysates obtained from the entire pretreated product and in which glucose was the largest carbon source. The ethanol yield from biomass suspensions with dry matter (DM) concentrations of 11–12% (w/v) was 70% based on total sugars (glucose, xylose, galactose). The results suggest that xylulose uptake was more effective in mixed hydrolysates containing glucose levels similar to, or higher than, xylose.Analysis of the factors that limit isomerase activity in lignocellulosic hydrolysates excluded any inhibition due to residual calcium ions after the detoxification of the hemicellulose hydrolysates with Ca(OH)2. By contrast, most of the enzyme activity ceased during the fermentation of the entire slurry after steam explosion, probably due to synergistic inhibition effects of various fermentation co-products.",

This contribution collects some major arguments for a fresh look at regulation of transgenic crops, they are in their molecular processes of creation not basically different from conventional crops, which are based in their breeding methods on natural, sometimes enhanced mutation. But the fascination and euphoria of the discoveries in molecular biology and the new perspectives in plant breeding in the sixties and seventies led to the wrong focus on transgenic plants alone. In a collective framing process the initial biosafety debates focused on the novelty of the process of transgenesis. When early debates on the risk assessment merged into legislative decisions, this wrong focus on transgenesis alone seemed uncontested. The process-focused view was also fostered by a conglomerate of concerned scientists and biotechnology companies, both with a vested interest to at least tolerate the rise of the safety threshold to secure research money and to discourage competitors of all kinds. Policy minded people and opponent activists without deeper insight in the molecular science agreed to those efforts without much resistance. It is interesting to realize, that the focus on processes was uncontested by a majority of regulators, this despite of serious early warnings from important authorities in science, mainly of US origin. It is time to change the regulation of genetically modified (GM) crops toward a more science based process — agnostic legislation. Although this article concentrates on the critique of the process-oriented regulation, including some details about the history behind, there should be no misunderstanding that there are other important factors responsible for the failure of this kind of process-oriented regulation, most importantly: the predominance of politics in the decision making processes combined with the lack of serious scientific debates on regulatory matters within the European Union and also in the Cartagena system, the obscure and much too complex decision making structures within the EU, and the active, professional, negative and intimidating role of fundamental opposition against GM crops on all levels dealing with flawed science, often declared as better parallel science published by ‘independent’ scientists.",

     "abstract": "Site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids (uAAs) during protein synthesis expands the proteomic code through the addition of unique residue chemistry. This field provides a unique tool to improve pharmacokinetics, cancer treatments, vaccine development, proteomics and protein engineering. The limited ability to predict the characteristics of proteins with uAA-incorporation creates a need for a low-cost system with the potential for rapid screening. Escherichia coli-based cell-free protein synthesis is a compelling platform for uAA incorporation due to the open and accessible nature of the reaction environment. However, typical cell-free systems can be expensive due to the high cost of energizing reagents. By employing alternative energy sources, we reduce the cost of uAA-incorporation in CFPS by 55%. While alternative energy systems reduce cost, the time investment to develop gene libraries can remain cumbersome. Cell-free systems allow the direct use of PCR products known as linear expression templates, thus alleviating tedious plasmid library preparations steps. We report the specific costs of CFPS with uAA incorporation, demonstrate that LETs are suitable expression templates with uAA-incorporation, and consider the substantial reduction in labor intensity using LET-based expression for CFPS uAA incorporation.",

     "abstract": "One of the issues in using polyclonal antibodies is the limited amount of reagent available from an immunisation, leading to batch-to-batch variation and difficulties in obtaining the same antibody performance when the same antigen is re-immunised into several separate animals. This led to the development of hybridoma technology allowing, at least theoretically, for an unlimited production of a specific binder. Nevertheless, polyclonal antibodies are widely used in research and diagnostics and there exists a need for robust methods to convert a polyclonal antibody with good binding performance into a renewable monoclonal with identical or similar binding specificity. Here we have used precise information regarding the functional recognition sequence (epitope) of a rabbit polyclonal antibody with attractive binding characteristics as the basis for generation of a renewable mouse monoclonal antibody. First, the original protein fragment antigen was used for immunisation and generation of mouse hybridoma, without obtaining binders to the same epitope region. Instead a peptide designed using the functional epitope and structural information was synthesised and used for hybridoma production. Several of the monoclonal antibodies generated were found to have similar binding characteristics to those of the original polyclonal antibody. These monoclonal antibodies detected native HER2 on cell lines and were also able to stain HER2 in immunohistochemistry using xenografted mice, as well as human normal and cancer tissues.",

The cationic character of nanocarriers was obtained by adding cationic surfactants, such as diisobutylphenoxyethyl-dimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride (DEBDA) or PEG-15 Cocopolyamine (PCPA), to the lipid composition. The products were characterised in terms of size and morphology by Cryo-TEM and PCS. The charge properties were determined by measuring the zeta potential. Our experimental protocol enabled us to obtain homogeneous and stable cationic nanosystems within 3–6 months of production. Assessment of cytotoxicity on HepG2 cells by MTT assays indicated that MAD preparations were less toxic than SLN, and in general PCPA-containing formulations are less cytotoxic than DEBDA-containing ones. The formation of electrostatic complexes with salmon sperm or plasmid DNA, used as model nucleic acids, was evaluated by electrophoresis on agarose gel. The results confirmed that all the formulations studied are able to form the complex. Finally, we investigated the ability of SLN and MAD to deliver DNA into HepG2 cells, and to this purpose we exploited expression plasmids for green fluorescent protein or firefly luciferase. Although with reduced efficiency, the results showed that the produced nanocarriers are able to convey plasmids into cells. The data obtained encourage further study aimed at improving these new formulations and proposing them as novel in vitro transfection reagents with potential application to in vivo delivery of nucleic acids.",

Experiments were conducted with several commercial cationic exchange resins in calcium, sodium and potassium forms packed in preparative columns (7 cm × 2.2 cm length × diameter). Resins in potassium form obtained the higher retention factor values for sugars when compared to the other ionic forms.

     "abstract": "Biotechnology is revolutionizing industrial and agricultural practice as the number of commercial biotechnology products is increasing each year. Simultaneously, several regulatory approaches are put into place to allow technological advancement while preserving public health and the environment. Developing and/or emerging countries often face major barriers to access biotechnologies and biotechnology derived products as they frequently lack the institutional capacities and professional competence in exercising regulatory oversight. To address this need, intensive biosafety capacity building is required. Different training approaches can be used to train individuals in biosafety ranging from long-term leading to a postgraduate certificate or a Masters degree, to short term courses. In this paper, we discuss the applicability of a different approach to biosafety capacity building based on a distance e-learning system, the UNIDO e-Biosafety program that has been annually organized at the Marche Polytechnic University (MPU) in Italy and Ghent University (UGent) in Belgium since 2006. Even though there are some challenges, we can conclude based on our experience that distance learning in combination with on-campus tuition is amendable for biosafety capacity building.",

Here we demonstrate that some food-grade lyophilised preparations of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus salivarius also show temporary bile sensitivity that can be rapidly reversed by rehydration. To protect dried bacterial cells from temporary bile sensitivity, we propose using bile acid adsorbing resins, such as cholestyramine, which are bile acid binding agents, historically used to lower cholesterol levels. Vcaps™ HPMC capsules alone provided up to 830-fold protection from bile. The inclusion of 50% w/w cholestyramine in Vcaps™ HPMC capsules resulted in release of up to 1700-fold more live Lactobacillus casei into simulated intestinal fluid containing 1% bile, when compared to dried cells added directly to bile. We conclude that delivery of dried live probiotic organisms to the intestine may be improved by providing protection from bile by addition of bile adsorbing resins and the use of HPMC capsules.",

These microorganisms can remove sulfur from dibenzothiphene (DBT), a model compound, or other polycyclic aromatic used as sulfur source, making BDS an easy and environmental friendly process. Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1B has been described as a desulfurizing bacterium, able to desulfurize DBT to 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2-HBP), the final product of the 4S pathway, using d-glucose as carbon source. However, both cell growth and desulfurization can be largely affected by the nutrient composition of the growth medium, due to cofactor requirements of many enzymes involved in the BDS biochemical pathway. In this study, the main goal was to investigate the influence of several sugars, as carbon source, on the growth and DBT desulfurization ability of G. alkanivorans strain 1B. The results of desulfurization tests showed that the lowest values for the growth rate (0.025 hour−1) and for the overall 2-HBP production rate (1.80 μm/hour) by the strain 1B were obtained in glucose grown cultures. When using sucrose, the growth rate increase exhibited by strain 1B led to a higher biomass productivity, which induced a slightly increase in the 2-HBP production rate (1.91 μm/hour), conversely in terms of 2-HBP specific production rate (q2-HBP) the value obtained was markedly lower (0.718 μmol/g/hour in sucrose versus 1.22 μmol/g/hour in glucose). When a mixture of glucose and fructose was used as carbon source, strain 1B reached a value of q2-HBP = 1.90 μmol/g/hour, close to that in fructose (q2-HBP = 2.12 μmol/g/hour). The highest values for both cell growth (μ = 0.091 hour−1) and 2-HPB production (9.29 μm/hour) were obtained when strain 1B was desulfurizing DBT in the presence of fructose as the only carbon source, indicating a fructophilic behaviour by this bacterium. This fact is in agreement with the highest value of biomass productivity by strain 1B be in fructose, which resulted in a higher amount cells fulfilling the DBT-desulfurization. The greater number of functional cells conducted to a more effectiveness BDS process by strain 1B, as they attained a q2-HBP about 74% higher than in glucose grown cultures. Moreover, this significant BDS enhancement can better be observed in terms of the overall 2-HBP production rate, which increased over 5-fold, from 1.80 μm/hour (in glucose) to 9.29 μm/hour (in fructose).",

Although their ecology and physiology are widely identified on the microbiological level, little emphasis has been laid on quantitative bioprocess development with extreme halophiles.The goal of this study was to establish, on the one hand, a methodological basis for quantitative bioprocess analysis of extreme halophilic Archaea with an extreme halophilic strain as an example. Firstly, as a novel usage, a corrosion resistant bioreactor setup for extreme halophiles has been implemented. Then, paying special attention to total bioprocess quantification approaches, an indirect method for biomass quantification using on-line process signals was introduced. Subsequently, robust quantitative data evaluation methods for halophiles could be developed, providing defined and controlled cultivation conditions in the bioreactor and therefore obtaining suitable quality of on-line as well as off-line datasets.On the other hand, new physiological results of extreme halophiles in bioreactor have also been obtained based on the quantitative methodological tools. For the first time, quantitative data on stoichiometry and kinetics were collected and evaluated on different carbon sources. The results on various substrates were interpreted, with proposed metabolic mechanisms, by linking to the reported primary carbon metabolism of extreme halophilic Archaea. Moreover, results of chemostat cultures demonstrated that extreme halophilic organisms show Monod-kinetics on different sole carbon sources. A diauxic growth pattern was described on a mixture of substrates in batch cultivations.In addition, the methodologies presented here enable one to characterize the utilized strain Haloferax mediterranei (HFX) as a potential new host organism. Thus, this study offers a strong methodological basis as well as a fundamental physiological assessment for bioreactor quantification of extreme halophiles that can serve as primary knowledge for applications of extreme halophiles in biotechnology.",

The PE-2 strain of this yeast is widely used to produce alcohol in Brazil due to its high fermentation capacity. The aim of the present study was to develop an expression system for recombinant proteins using the industrial PE-2 strain of S. cerevisiae during the alcoholic fermentation process. The protein chosen as a model for this system was CaneCPI-1, a cysteine peptidase inhibitor. A plasmid containing the CaneCPI-1 gene was constructed and yeast cells were transformed with the pYADE4_CaneCPI-1 construct. To evaluate the effect on fermentation ability, the transformed strain was used in the fermentation process with cell recycling. During the nine-hour fermentative cycles the transformed strain did not have its viability and fermentation ability affected. In the last cycle, when the fermentation lasted longer, the protein was expressed probably at the expense of ethanol once the sugars were exhausted. The recombinant protein was expressed in yeast cells, purified and submitted to assays of activity that demonstrated its functionality. Thus, the industrial PE-2 strain of S. cerevisiae can be used as a viable system for protein expression and to produce alcohol simultaneously. The findings of the present study demonstrate the possibility of producing recombinant proteins with biotechnological applications during the ethanol fermentation process.",

One of the major barriers for their widespread introduction in the market is the higher production costs compared with their petrochemical counterparts.

The strain Burkholderia sacchari DSM 17165 which is able to metabolise glucose, xylose and arabinose, the main sugars present in wheat straw hydrolysates (WSHs), was used. Results in shake flask showed that B. sacchari cells accumulated about 70% g poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P(3HB))/g cell dry weight (CDW) with a yield of polymer on sugars (YP/S) of 0.18 g/g when grown on a mixture of commercial C6 and C5 sugars (control), while these values reached about 60% g P(3HB)/g CDW and 0.19 g/g, respectively, when WSHs were used as carbon source. In fed-batch cultures carried out in 2 L stirred-tank reactors (STRs) on WSH, a maximum polymer concentration of 105 g/L was reached after 61 hours of cultivation corresponding to an accumulation of 72% of CDW. Polymer yield and productivity were 0.22 g P(3HB)/g total sugar consumed and 1.6 g/L hour, respectively. The selected feeding strategy successfully overcame the carbon catabolite repression (CCR) phenomenon observed with sugar mixtures containing hexoses and pentoses.

In high-cell density fed-batch fermentations, P. putida S12 surprisingly performed better on crude glycerol than on purified glycerol. By contrast, growth of Escherichia coli was severely compromised under these high cell density cultivation conditions on crude glycerol. For P. putida S12 the biomass-to-substrate yield, maximum biomass production rate and substrate uptake rate were consistently higher on crude glycerol. Moreover, production of p-hydroxybenzoate by engineered P. putida S12palB5 on crude glycerol showed a 10% yield improvement over production on purified glycerol. P. putida S12 is a favorable host for bioconversion processes utilizing crude glycerol as a substrate.

The readily available genetic tools and the ease of high-cell density cultivations using methanol or glycerol/methanol mixtures are among the key factors for this development. Previous studies have shown that the use of mixed feeds of glycerol and methanol seem to alleviate the metabolic burden derived from protein production, allowing for higher specific and volumetric process productivities. However, initial studies of glycerol/methanol co-metabolism in P. pastoris by classical metabolic flux analyses using 13C-derived Metabolic Flux Ratio (METAFoR) constraints were hampered by the reduced labelling information obtained when using C3:C1 substrate mixtures in relation to the conventional C6 substrate, that is, glucose. In this study, carbon flux distributions through the central metabolic pathways in glycerol/methanol co-assimilation conditions have been further characterised using biosynthetically directed fractional 13C labelling. In particular, metabolic flux distributions were obtained under 3 different glycerol/methanol ratios and growth rates by iterative fitting of NMR-derived 13C-labelling data from proteinogenic amino acids using the software tool 13CFlux2. Specifically, cells were grown aerobically in chemostat cultures fed with 80:20, 60:40 and 40:60 (w:w) glycerol/methanol mixtures at two dilutions rates (0.05 hour−1 and 0.16 hour−1), allowing to obtain additional data (biomass composition and extracellular fluxes) to complement pre-existing datasets. The performed 13C-MFA reveals a significant redistribution of carbon fluxes in the central carbon metabolism as a result of the shift in the dilution rate, while the ratio of carbon sources has a lower impact on carbon flux distribution in cells growing at the same dilution rate. At low growth rate, the percentage of methanol directly dissimilated to CO2 ranges between 50% and 70%. At high growth rate the methanol is completely dissimilated to CO2 by the direct pathway, in the two conditions of highest methanol content.",

The use of an external electron acceptor may improve the metabolism of SA synthesis by A. succinogenes in glycerol. In this study, the effect of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), an electron acceptor, on glycerol consumption and SA production by A. succinogenes under controlled fermentation conditions was investigated. Concentrations of DMSO between 1 and 4% (v/v) greatly promoted glycerol consumption and SA production by A. succinogenes. During fed-batch cultivation, SA concentration reached 49.62 g/L, with a product yield of 0.87 g SA/g GLR and a maximum production rate of 2.31 g SA/L h, the highest values so far reported in the literature for A. succinogenes using glycerol as carbon source.

One common limit of the major part of the xylose-fermenting yeasts is the diauxic shift between the uptake of glucose and xylose during the fermentation of mixed syrups. Thus, optimized fermentation strategies are required.In this paper the ability of Scheffersomyces stipitis strain NRRLY-11544 to ferment mixed syrups with a total sugar concentration in the range 40–80 g/L was investigated by using mono cultures, co-cultures with Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Bakers Yeast Type II and single cultures immobilized in silica-hydrogel films. The experimental design for the fermentations with immobilized cells included the process analysis in function of two parameters: the fraction of the gel in the broth and the concentration of the cells loaded in the gel. Furthermore, for each total sugars level, the fermentative course of S. stipitis was analyzed at several glucose-to xylose ratios.The results indicated that the use of S. stipitis and S. cerevisiae in free co-cultures ensured faster processes than single cultures of S. stipitis either free or immobilized. However, the rapid production of ethanol by S. cerevisiae inhibited S. stipitis and caused a stuck of the process.Immobilization of S. stipitis in silica-hydrogel increased the relative consumption rate of xylose-to-glucose by 2–6 times depending on the composition of the fermentation medium. Furthermore the films performances appeared stable over three weeks of continuous operations. However, on the whole, the final process yields obtained with the immobilized cells were not meaningfully different from that of the free cells. This was probably due to concurrent fermentations operated by the cells released in the broth. Optimization of the carrier characteristics could improve the performances of the process with immobilized cells.",

     "abstract": "Inulin is a carbohydrate composed of linear chains of β-2,1-linked D-fructofuranose molecules terminated by a glucose residue through a sucrose-type linkage at the reducing end. Jerusalem artichoke (JA) is one of the most interesting materials among unconventional and renewable raw materials, with levels of inulin reaching 50–80% of dry matter. Inulin or inulin-rich materials can be actively hydrolyzed by microbial inulinases to produce glucose and fructose syrups that can be used in bioprocesses. In this study, several microbial strains were isolated and their ability to inulinase biosynthesis was evaluated. The novel yeast strain Talf1, identified as Zygosaccharomyces bailii, was the best inulinase producer, attaining 8.67 U/ml of inulinase activity when JA juice was used as the inducer substrate. Z. bailii strain Talf1 and/or its enzymatic crude extract were further applied for bioethanol production and biodesulfurization (BDS) processes, using inulin and JA juice as carbon source. In a consolidated bioprocessing for ethanol production from 200 g/l inulin, Z. bailii strain Talf1 was able to produce 67 g/l of ethanol. This ethanol yield was improved in a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process, with the ethanologenic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCMI 885 and the Talf1 inulinases, achieving a production of 78 g/l ethanol. However, the highest ethanol yield (∼48%) was obtained in a SSF process from JA juice (∼130 g/l fermentable sugars), where the S. cerevisiae produced 63 g/l ethanol. Relatively to the dibenzothiophene BDS tests, the Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1B achieved a desulfurization rate of 4.8 μM/h within a SSF process using Talf1 inulinases and JA juice, highlighting the potential of JA as a less expensive alternative carbon source. These results showed the high potential of Z. bailii strain Talf1 inulinases as a versatile tool for bioprocesses using inulin-rich materials.",

     "abstract": "Whey and scotta are effluents coming from cheese and ricotta processing respectively. Whey contains minerals, lipids, lactose and proteins; scotta contains mainly lactose. Whey can be reused in several ways, such as protein extraction or animal feeding, while nowadays scotta is just considered as a waste; moreover, due to very high volumes of whey produced in the world, it poses serious environmental and disposal problems. Alternative destinations of these effluents, such as biotechnological transformations, can be a way to reach both goals of improving the added value of the agroindustrial processes and reducing their environmental impact.In this work we investigated the way to produce bioethanol from lactose of whey and scotta and to optimize the fermentation yields. Kluyveromyces marxianus var. marxianus was chosen as lactose-fermenting yeast. Batch, aerobic and anaerobic, fermentations and semicontinuous fermentations in dispersed phase and in packed bed reactor were carried out of row whey, scotta and mix 1:1 whey:scotta at a laboratory scale. Different temperatures (28–40°C) were also tested to check whether the thermotolerance of the chosen yeast could be useful to improve the ethanol yield.The best performances were reached at low temperatures (28°C); high temperatures are also compatible with good ethanol yields in whey fermentations, but not in scotta fermentations. Semicontinuous fermentations in dispersed phase gave the best fermentation performances, particularly with scotta. Then both effluents can be considered suitable for ethanol production. The good yields obtained from scotta allow us to transform this waste in a source.",

     "abstract": "In biogas plants agricultural waste and energy crops are converted by complex microbial communities to methane for the production of renewable energy. In Germany, this process is widely applied namely in context of agricultural production systems. However, process disturbances, are one of the major causes for economic losses. In addition, the conversion of biomass, in particular of cellulose, is in most cases incomplete and, hence, insufficient. Besides technical aspects, a more profound characterization concerning the functionality of the microbial communities involved would strongly support the improvement of yield and stability in biogas production. To monitor these communities on the functional level, metaproteome analysis was applied in this study to full-scale agricultural biogas plants. Proteins were extracted directly from sludge for separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and subsequent identification with mass spectrometry. Protein profiles obtained with SDS–PAGE were specific for different biogas plants and often stable for several months. Differences of protein profiles were visualized by clustering, which allowed not only the discrimination between mesophilic and thermophilic operated biogas plants but also the detection of process disturbances such as acidification. In particular, acidification of a biogas plant was detected in advance by disappearance of major bands in SDS–PAGE. Identification of proteins from SDS–PAGE gels revealed that methyl CoM reductase, which is responsible for the release of methane during methanogenesis, from the order Methanosarcinales was significantly decreased.Hence, it is assumed that this enzyme might be a promising candidate to serve as a predictive biomarker for acidification.",

The effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) was tested by increasing the dilution rate gradually. Three different immobilization materials (stainless steel wire, glass raschig ring and Vukopor®) were tested. The highest productivity was reported with the reactor filled with stainless steel wire as 4.8 g/(L hours) and the highest 1,3-propanediol concentration was 17.9 g/L when glass raschig rings were used as the packing material with the HRTs of 0.5 hours and 1.5 hours, respectively. Compared to the suspended culture system 1,3-propanediol production was more resistant to shorter hydraulic retention times that leads to higher 1,3-PDO productivities. All three of the materials are good candidates for immobilization purpose; however, stainless steel wire and Vukopor® are better support materials in terms of productivities. The results reported in this study revealed that continuous fermentation in a packed-bed bioreactor system is a suitable method to enhance 1,3-propanediol production.",

Polymers were produced by growing H. pseudoflava DSM 1034 in minimal medium supplemented with sucrose, lactose or whey without any co-substrate added. The chemical and physical properties of the polymers were fully characterized by GPC, DSC, TGA analyses and the composition by GC and 1H NMR examinations to especially confirm the content of different monomeric units. The presence of 4HB units into PHA samples is particularly aimed in thermoplastic applications where greater flexibility is required and conventional rigid PHAs tend to fail. Usually the insertion of 4HB into chain backbone consisting of 3-hydroxyalkanoates requires expensive carbon sources mostly of petrochemical origin. According to our study the production of P(3HB-co-3HV-co-4HB) terpolymer can be obtained directly by the use of lactose or waste raw materials such as cheese whey as carbon sources. Although the amount of 4HB in the produced terpolymers was usually low and not exceeding 10% of the total molar composition, a PHA containing 18.4% of 4HB units was produced in 1 step fermentation process from this structurally unrelated carbon sources. The crystallinity of the terpolymer is basically to be markedly affected with respect to that of conventional PHAs, thus obtaining a comparatively less rigid material and easier to be processed.",

     "abstract": "Society is fundamentally ambivalent to the use of plastics. On the one hand, plastics are uniquely flexible materials that have seen them occupy a huge range of functions, from simple packing materials to complex engineering components. On the other hand, their durability has raised concerns about their end-of-life disposal. When that disposal route is landfill, their invulnerability to microbial decomposition, combined with relatively low density and high bulk, means that plastics will occupy increasing amounts of landfill space in a world where available suitable landfill sites is shrinking.The search for biodegradable plastics and their introduction to the marketplace would appear to be a suitable amelioration strategy for such a problem. And yet the uptake of biodegradable plastics has been slow. The term biodegradable itself has entered public controversy, with accidental and intended misuse of the term; the intended misuse has led to accusations and instances of ‘greenwashing’. For this and other reasons standards for biodegradability and compostability testing of plastics have been sought.An environmental dilemma with more far-reaching implications is climate change. The need for rapid and deep greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions cuts is one of the drivers for the resurgence of industrial biotechnology generally, and the search for bio-based plastics more specifically. Bio-based has come to mean plastics based on renewable resources, but this need not necessarily imply biodegradability. If the primary purpose is GHG emissions savings, then once again plastics durability can be a virtue, if the end-of-life solution can be energy recovery during incineration or recycling. The pattern of production is shifting from the true biodegradable plastics to the bio-based plastics, and that trend is likely to persist into the future.This paper looks at aspects of the science of biodegradable and bio-based plastics from the perspective of policy advisers and makers. It is often said that the bioplastics suffer from a lack of a favourable policy regime when compared to the wide-ranging set of policy instruments that are available on both the supply and demand side of biofuels production. Some possible policy measures are discussed.",

The Ag or Cu nanoparticles were used as the catalyst, and acetylene (C2H2) gas was used as the carbon source. An anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), was used for the preparation of the Cu/Ag-ACF composites to prevent the agglomeration of Cu(II) and Ag(I) ions and achieve a uniform mono-dispersion during the impregnation step. The prepared composites with Cu and Ag dispersed in the ACF and ACF/CNF were characterized using several analytical techniques, including atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermal programming reduction (TPR). The antibacterial properties of the prepared multi-scale or hierarchical structures were evaluated against the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) and the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The results revealed that the prepared Ag-ACF/CNFs were highly effective against these bacteria, achieving a complete inhibition of bacterial growth for over 72 hours.",

If correctly applied such an approach could become a very effective way to remediate excess of chemicals. The concentration of nitrogen, especially nitrate deriving from agricultural managements, is generally found to increase in water flow. Therefore, by forcing the water flow through a buffer strip specifically designed and possibly afforested with suitable plant species, may result effective in reducing high nitrogen contents. The management of a riparian buffer may definitely affect the soil microbial activities, including denitrification, as well as the composition of the community.The present study reports on the changes occurred in terms of denitrifying microbial community composition, as compared to that of a neighbouring agricultural area, as a consequence of hydraulic management coupled to the suspension of farming practices and to the development of the woody and herbaceous vegetation.With this aim, denitrification was repeatedly measured and the data obtained were related to those deriving from a specific analysis of bacterial groups involved in denitrification. nirK, encoding for nitrite reductase, an enzyme essential for the conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide and considered the key step in the denitrification process, was chosen as the target gene.The main results obtained indicated that denitrification activity changes in riparian buffer as compared to agricultural soil and it is strongly influenced by carbon availability and soil depth. Although no significant differences on the community composition between superficial (0–15 cm) and medium (40–55 cm) layers were observed, the nirK-type denitrifier community was shown to significantly differ between riparian and agricultural soils in both surface and medium layers.",

The plants treated with the product showed an increased resistance to tearing out with respect to other treatments and roots were longer with respect to the control. Microbial analyses of the product evidenced bacterial and yeast species with plant growth promoting activity, such as Stenothrophomonas maltophilia, Candida utilis and several Lactobacillus species. Some Lactobacillus strains were also found to be able to colonize plant roots.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the population dynamics which occurred in mixed cultures of Neochloris oleoabundans with other native microalgae, in mixtures of a synthetic medium (BBM) and water of an urban polluted river. The effect of temperature, nutrient availability and the microscopic monitoring of the population dynamics in such mixed cultures were carried out. Furthermore, the isolation of the predominant consortium of diatoms and the evaluation of its kinetics of growth and its capacity for removal of pollutants was also performed. Results indicated that such green microalgae only predominated in mixtures containing 80% or 60% of the synthetic medium. In mixtures containing a volume of the polluted river higher than 40%, other microalgae predominated, especially diatoms of various genera. The diatom consortium isolated from a 100% of the river's water sampled in spring (April), was formed mainly by a population of Nitzchia frustulum and in less extent of Navicula sp. It showed a significantly higher specific growth rate when cultivated in water from the river, compared to cultures in synthetic modified diatom medium (MDM) and at 32°C, compared to cultures incubated at 25°C.

To control such risk, bioremediation constitutes an environmentally friendly alternative technology that has been established and applied. It constitutes the primary mechanism for the elimination of hydrocarbons from contaminated sites by natural existing populations of microorganisms.In this work, a collection of 125 strains, adapted to grow on minimal medium supplemented with crude oil, was obtained from contaminated sediments and seawater from a refinery harbor of the Bizerte coast in the North of Tunisia. The diversity of the bacterial collection was analyzed by amplification of the internal transcribed spacers between the 16S and the 23S rRNA genes (ITS-PCR) and by 16S rRNA sequencing. A total of 36 distinct ITS haplotypes were detected on agarose matrix. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing performed on 50 isolates showed high level of identity with known sequences. Strains were affiliated to Ochrabactrum, Sphingobium, Acinetobacter, Gordonia, Microbacterium, Brevundimonas, Novosphingobium, Stenotrophomonas, Luteibacter, Rhodococcus, Agrobacterium, Achromobacter, Bacilllus, Kocuria and Pseudomonas genera. Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomons were found to be the most abundant species characterized by a marked microdiversity as shown through ITS typing. Culture-independent approach (DGGE) showed high diversity in the microbial community in all the studied samples with a clear correlation with the hydrocarbon pollution rate. Sequencing of the DGGE bands revealed a high proportion of Proteobacteria represented by the Alpha and Gamma subclasses. The predominant bacterial detected by both dependent and independent approaches were the Proteobacteria. The biotechnological potential of the isolates revealed a significant production of biosurfactants with important emulsification activities useful in bioremediation. The highest emulsification activity was detected in Pseudomonas geniculata with 52.77% of emulsification. Our overall results suggest that the obtained bacterial isolates may constitute potential candidates for bioremediation and can be useful for biotechnological applications.",

     "abstract": "Oil spills can be disastrous to any ecosystem. Bioremediation through bioaugmentation (addition of oil-degrading bacteria) and biostimulation (addition of nutrients N&P) options can be a promising strategy for combating oil spills following first response actions. However, bioaugmentation is one of the most controversial issues of bioremediation since nutrient addition alone has a greater effect on oil biodegradation than the addition of microbial products that are highly dependent on environmental conditions. There is increasing evidence that the best way to overcome the above barriers is to use microorganisms from the polluted area, an approach proposed as autochthonous bioaugmentation (ABA) and defined as the bioaugmentation technology that uses exclusively microorganisms indigenous to the sites (soil, sand, and water) to be decontaminated. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of an ABA strategy for the successful remediation of polluted marine environments. A consortium was enriched from seawater samples taken from Elefsina Gulf near the Hellenic Petroleum Refinery, a site exposed to chronic crude oil pollution. Pre-adapted consortium was tested alone or in combination with inorganic nutrients in the presence (or not) of biosurfactants (rhamnolipids) in 30-day experiments. Treatment with fertilizers in the presence of biosurfactants exhibited the highest alkane and PAH degradation and showed highest growth over a period of almost 15 days. Considering the above, the use of biostimulation additives in combination with naturally pre-adapted hydrocarbon degrading consortia has proved to be a very effective treatment and it is a promising strategy in the future especially when combined with lipophilic fertilizers instead of inorganic nutrients. Such an approach becomes more pertinent when the oil spill approaches near the shoreline and immediate hydrocarbon degradation is needed.",

All the Mediterranean countries have adopted severe regulations for minimizing pollution events and bioremediation feasibility studies for the most urgent polluted sites are undergoing. However, the analysis of the scientific studies applying modern ‘meta-omics’ technologies that have been performed on marine oil pollution worldwide showed that the Southern Mediterranean side has been neglected by the international research. Most of the studies in the Mediterranean Sea have been done in polluted sites of the Northern side of the basin. Those of the Southern side are poorly studied, despite many of the Southern countries being major oil producers and exporters. The recently EU-funded research project ULIXES has as a major objective to increase the knowledge of the bioremediation potential of sites from the Southern Mediterranean countries. ULIXES is targeting four major polluted sites on the coastlines of Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia, including seashore sands, lagoons, and oil refinery polluted sediments. The research is designed to unravel, categorize, catalogue, exploit and manage the diversity and ecology of microorganisms thriving in these polluted sites. Isolation of novel hydrocarbon degrading microbes and a series of state of the art ‘meta-omics’ technologies are the baseline tools for improving our knowledge on biodegradation capacities mediated by microbes under different environmental settings and for designing novel site-tailored bioremediation approaches. A network of twelve European and Southern Mediterranean partners is cooperating for plugging the existing gap of knowledge for the development of novel bioremediation processes targeting such poorly investigated polluted sites.",

     "abstract": "This study investigated the feasibility of using a polarized graphite electrode as direct or indirect (via electrolytic oxygen generation) electron acceptor to stimulate the microbial oxidation of cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) in contaminated groundwater. A microbial culture was enriched in the anode chamber of a bioelectrochemical cell using a mixture of cis-DCE and ethene as substrates. The bioelectrochemical cell was operated by controlling the anode potential at +1.0 V or +1.5 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). Enhanced cometabolic removal of cis-DCE, with ethene serving as the growth substrate, was observed in batch tests with the anode polarized at +1.5 V versus SHE. At this potential, (chloro)ethenes removal was probably sustained by molecular oxygen generated at the anode from water oxidation. Conversely, negligible anaerobic degradation was observed at +1.0 V versus SHE (a potential which does not allow oxygen generation), hence suggesting that molecular oxygen is needed to initiate (chloro)ethene degradation. PCR-DGGE analysis of the microbial culture followed by band sequencing and phylogenetic analysis evidenced the selective enrichment of a Bacillus species, providing a strong indication that this microorganism was responsible for cis-DCE and ethene degradation.",

Dehalococcoides mccartyi, considered to be the primary dechlorinating bacterium able to completely degrade chlorinated hydrocarbons to non toxic ethene, could be detected by CAtalyzed Reporter Deposition Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (CARD-FISH) since the beginning of culture operation but highlighted by conventional FISH only during active PCE dechlorination to ethene and vinyl chloride (VC). Data generated from FISH and CARD-FISH analyses were compared to those generated from applying PCR-based techniques directed at defining cell abundances (Real Time PCR, qPCR) and assessing cell activities (Reverse Transcription qPCR, RT-qPCR) of Dehalococcoides strains involved in the PCE reductive dechlorination (RD) process. qPCR targeting reductive dehalogenase genes coding for enzymes involved in the individual steps of the RD process, showed that Dehalococcoides strains carrying the tceA gene dominated the community. This observation was consistent with PCE conversion products detected under pseudo-steady state (ethene and VC production), since this tceA gene is known to be associated to strains capable of reducing chlorinated solvents beyond 1,2-cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE). In line with the FISH data, Dehalococcoides 16S rRNA and tceA genes were expressed only during pseudo-steady state conditions when PCE was converted completely to the final metabolic product ethene. Furthermore, Dehalococcoides cell abundances estimated by CARD-FISH correlated positively with their 16SrRNA gene copy numbers quantified by qPCR. This is consistent with the ability of both these methods to estimate total Dehalococcoides cell numbers including those with low metabolic activities. Thus, this study shows that application potential of FISH analysis to quantify rapidly and efficiently only active dechlorinators in complex communities.",

This activity can be disrupted by organic and inorganic pollutants present in wastewater streams. Hence, it is of primary importance to investigate and monitor the structure and functionality of the sludge-resident microbial communities. We simulated a 3-chloroaniline (3-CA) shock load in 3-CA adapted and non-adapted semi-continuous activated-sludge (SCAS) reactors to selectively stress the Ammonia Oxidizing Bacteria (AOB). Recently developed setting-independent theoretical interpretation of molecular DNA and RNA fingerprinting patterns were used to evaluate the responses of the microbial populations.Ammonium accumulation in treated reactors upon 3-CA addition confirmed the disruption of the functionality under stress conditions. Molecular analyses coupled to their interpretation highlighted that shock loaded reactors clustered separately from non-treated ones, especially when AOBs community was specifically targeted. Furthermore, the interpretation of RNA-based analyses, as compared to DNA-based ones, allowed to more promptly depicting shifts in a stressed community. We showed that the use of RNA-based molecular tools in combination with a new set of parameters is a powerful tool to link functional failures with microbial structure modifications in WWTPs, providing a potential tool for a rational optimization of the processes (Microbial Resource Management – MRM).",

Through plant activities and microorganism metabolisms, it is possible to recover dredged saline sediments by decontaminating them until an artificially prepared soil that is reusable in the terrestrial environment is obtained. This is an important advantage from the environmental point of view, and allows to partially solve one of the main problems of most commercial ports, that is the accumulation, storage and disposal of polluted dredged sediments. Considering that bacteria provide a significant contribution to phytoremediation process. Aim of the present study is the monitoring of temporal variation of microbial communities developing in an experimental phytoremediation plant during the decontamination process. The treatment plant consists of a sealed 80 m3 basin that is filled with a mixture of dredged sediments (75%) and natural soil (25%). It was planted with three plant species, and has been properly cultivated and fertilized for two years. Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) on 16S rRNA gene was used to study the composition of bacterial communities at different times and points in the basin. Cluster Analysis (CA) and Non Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) multivariate statistics were applied for data interpretation. At the onset, the bacterial communities were heterogeneous and discrete, reflecting those inherited from the sediment–soil mixture, from compost and from plant's rhizospheres. The communities’ composition rapidly changed to become stabilized after one year.",

Phytoremediation using plants and their associated microbes has been increasingly used as a green technology for cleaning up TM-polluted soils. In this study, we investigated the effect of inoculating two arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal isolates, Rhizophagus irregularis and Funneliformis mosseae, on trace metal uptake by sunflower plants grown in soils contaminated with three different Cd concentrations in a greenhouse trial. Root colonization, plant dry mass, and plant tissue cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) concentrations in roots and shoots were determined after sunflower harvesting. We found that root mycorrhizal colonization rates were not significantly affected by Cd treatments. At low soil Cd concentration, R. irregularis-inoculated plants had significantly higher shoot Cd and Zn concentrations than plants inoculated with F. mosseae and non-inoculated plants. However, at high soil Cd concentrations, F. mosseae-inoculated plants had significantly lower shoot Cd and Zn concentrations and biological concentration factor (BCF) values than plants inoculated with R. irregularis and non-inoculated plants. Cadmium was mainly translocated in shoot tissues of R. irregularis-inoculated plants and sequestered in the rhizosphere of F. mosseae-inoculated plants. The results indicate that these AMF strains mediate different tolerance strategies to alleviate TM toxicity in their host plants and that inoculation with the R. irregularis strain can be used for Cd phytoextraction, whereas this F. mosseae strain can be useful for Cd and Zn phytostabilization of contaminated soil.",

Recent studies show the high potential of nano-sized Fe oxides in the environment as, for example, electron acceptor for microbial respiration, electron shuttle between different microorganisms, and scavenger for heavy metals. Biotic and abiotic reactivity of iron macroparticles differ significantly from nano-sized Fe oxides, which are usually much more reactive. Factors such as particle size, solubility, ferrous iron, crystal structure, and organic molecules were identified to influence the reactivity.This review discusses factors influencing the microbial reactivity of Fe oxides. It highlights the differences between natural and synthetic Fe oxides especially regarding the presence of organic molecules such as humic acids and natural organic matter. Attention is given to the transport behavior of Fe oxides in laboratory systems and in the environment, because of the high affinity of different contaminants to Fe oxide surfaces and associated co-transport of pollutants. The high reactivity of Fe oxides and their potential as adsorbents for different pollutants are discussed with respect to application and development of remediation technologies.",

     "abstract": "Many organic compounds present at low concentrations in municipal wastewater, such as various pharmaceuticals and biocides, are recalcitrant in conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). To improve their biodegradation, oxidoreductase enzymes such as laccases were tested. The goal was to find optimal conditions for the transformation of two anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals (diclofenac (DFC) and mefenamic acid (MFA)), one biocide (triclosan (TCN)) and one plastic additive (bisphenol A (BPA)) by Trametes versicolor laccase. Experiments were conducted in spiked solutions at different pH values (from 3 to 9), enzyme concentrations (70–1400 U l−1), reaction times (0–26 hours) and temperatures (10, 25 and 40°C) following a Doehlert experimental design. A semi-empirical model was developed to understand better the combined effects of the four factors and to determine optimal values. This model was able to fit well the experimental data (R2 > 0.97) and showed good predictive ability. All four factors had a significant effect on the micropollutant oxidation with the greatest influence shown by pH. Results for single compounds were different from those obtained for mixtures of micropollutants. For instance, DFC transformation occurred at much higher rates in mixtures under alkaline conditions. Optimal conditions were compound-dependent, but were found to be between pH 4.5 to 6.5 and between 25°C to more than 40°C. A laccase concentration of 730 U l−1 was sufficient to obtain a high removal rate (>90%) of the four individual compounds (range of times: 40 min to 5 hours), showing the potential of laccases to improve biodegradation of environmentally persistent compounds.",

To date there is no effective and sustainable remediation strategy available. Laccases from white rot fungi were found particularly attractive for the removal of some micropollutants such as the plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA), the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (DF) and the steroidal hormone 17-α-ethinylestradiol (EE2). Laccase immobilization is a prerequisite for their use in continuous water treatment processes. In this study, laccase from Coriolopsis gallica was immobilized on mesoporous silica spheres in a two-step adsorption-crosslinking process. The initial laccase activity, crosslinker (glutaraldehyde) concentration and extra protein (albumin) concentration were varied following a central composite experimental design and optimized with respect to the immobilization yield, activity and thermal stability of the biocatalysts. After a multi-objective optimization of the biocatalyst formulation, a maximum biocatalyst activity of 383 U g−1, determined with 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) at pH 4.5, was obtained. Biocatalyst particles were physically characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda pore size analyses revealing few modifications of the surface area and structure during/after the immobilization procedure. The biocatalyst showed a significantly higher thermostability than the free enzyme with a half-life of 31.5 hours and 3.9 hours compared to 6.1 hours and 0.6 hours at 55°C and 75°C respectively. The biocatalyst was able to eliminate in a continuously stirred membrane reactor more than 95% of BPA 10 μM and EE2 10 μM and 70% of DF 10 μM when treated individually and more than 90% when treated as a mixture in aqueous buffered solution (pH 5) for more than 60 reactor volumes. In real wastewater conditions (pH 7.8) the biocatalyst could degrade more than 85% of BPA and EE2 along with 30% of DF when tested in mixture for more than 80 hours, which illustrates the potential of this biocatalyst for the treatment of aquatic micropollutants.",

     "abstract": "Antarctic bacteria represent a reservoir of unexplored biodiversity, which, in turn, might be correlated to the synthesis of still undescribed bioactive molecules, such as antibiotics. In this work we have further characterized a panel of four marine Antarctic bacteria able to inhibit the growth of human opportunistic multiresistant pathogenic bacteria belonging to the Burkholderia cepacia complex (responsible for the ‘cepacia’ syndrome in Cystic Fibrosis patients) through the production of a set of microbial Volatile Organic Compounds (mVOCs). A list of 30 different mVOCs synthesized under aerobic conditions by Antarctic bacteria was identified by GC-SPME analysis. Cross-streaking experiments suggested that Antarctic bacteria might also synthesize non-volatile molecules able to enhance the anti-Burkholderia activity. The biosynthesis of such a mixture of mVOCs was very probably influenced by both the presence/absence of oxygen and the composition of media used to grow the Antarctic strains. The antimicrobial activity exhibited by Antarctic strains also appeared to be more related to their taxonomical position rather than to the sampling site. Different Bcc bacteria were differently sensitive to the ‘Antarctic’ mVOCs and this was apparently related neither to the taxonomical position of the different strains nor to their source. The genome sequence of three new Antarctic strains was determined revealing that only P. atlantica TB41 possesses some genes belonging to the nrps–pks cluster. The comparative genomic analysis performed on the genome of the four strains also revealed the presence of a few genes belonging to the core genome and involved in the secondary metabolites biosynthesis. Data obtained suggest that the antimicrobial activity exhibited by Antarctic bacteria might rely on a (complex) mixture of mVOCs whose relative concentration may vary depending on the growth conditions. Besides, it is also possible that the biosynthesis of these compounds might occur through still unknown metabolic pathways.",

These environments whilst harsh are ironically fragile and dependent on a harmonious life form balance. Exploitation of natural resources by exhaustive wild harvesting has obvious negative environmental consequences. From a European industry perspective marine organisms are a largely underutilised resource. This is not due to lack of interest but due to a lack of choice the industry faces for cost competitive, sustainable and environmentally conscientious product alternatives. Knowledge of the biotechnological potential of marine organisms together with the development of sustainable systems for their cultivation, processing and utilisation are essential. In 2010, the European Commission recognised this need and funded a collaborative RTD/SME project under the Framework 7-Knowledge Based Bio-Economy (KBBE) Theme 2 Programme ‘Sustainable culture of marine microorganisms, algae and/or invertebrates for high value added products’. The scope of that project entitled ‘Sustainable Production of Biologically Active Molecules of Marine Based Origin’ (BAMMBO) is outlined. Although the Union is a global leader in many technologies, it faces increasing competition from traditional rivals and emerging economies alike and must therefore improve its innovation performance. For this reason innovation is placed at the heart of a European Horizon 2020 Strategy wherein the challenge is to connect economic performance to eco performance. This article provides a synopsis of the research activities of the BAMMBO project as they fit within the wider scope of sustainable environmentally conscientious marine resource exploitation for high-value biomolecules.",

     "abstract": "Unlike the other major crops, no genetically modified (GM) varieties of rice have been commercialized at a large scale. Within the next 2–3 years new transgenic rice varieties could be ready for regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization, though. Given the importance of rice as staple crop for many of the world's poorest people, this will have implications for the alleviation of poverty, hunger and malnutrition. Thus, policy-makers need to be aware of the potential benefits of GM rice. We provide an overview of the literature and discuss the evidence on expected agronomic and consumer benefits of genetically engineered rice. We find that while GM rice with improved agronomic traits could deliver benefits similar to already commercialized biotechnology crops, expected benefits of consumer traits could be higher by an order of magnitude. By aggregating the expected annual benefits, we estimate the global value of GM rice to be US$64 billion per year. This is only an indicative value, as more GM varieties will become available in future. Nevertheless, such a figure can help guide policy-makers when deciding on the approval or funding of biotechnology crops and it may also raise awareness among consumers about what is at stake for their societies.",

The use of GM in farmed animals (aquatic, terrestrial and pharmaceutical) was mapped and reviewed. A foresight exercise was conducted to identity future developments. Three case studies (aquatic, terrestrial and pharmaceutical) were applied to identify the issues raised, including the potential risks and benefits of GM animals from the perspectives of the production chain (economics and agri-food sector) and the life sciences (human and animal health, environmental impact, animal welfare and sustainable production). Ethical and policy concerns were examined through application of combined ethical matrix method and policy workshops.

The results suggest that public perceptions, ethical issues, the competitiveness of EU animal production and risk-benefit assessments that consider human and animal health, environmental impact and sustainable production need to be considered in EU policy development.

Although still in its infancy, recent advances in optogenetics has made it possible to remotely manipulate in vivo cellular functions using light. Coined Nature Methods’ ‘Method of the Year’ in 2010, the optogenetic toolbox has the potential to control cell, tissue and even animal behaviour. This optogenetic toolbox consists of light-sensitive proteins that are able to modulate membrane potential in response to light. Channelrhodopsins (ChR) are light-gated microbial ion channels, which were first described in green algae. ChR2 (a subset of ChR) is a seven transmembrane α helix protein, which evokes membrane depolarization and mediates an action potential upon photostimulation with blue (470 nm) light. By contrast to other seven-transmembrane proteins that require second messengers to open ion channels, ChR2 form ion channels themselves, allowing ultrafast depolarization (within 50 milliseconds of illumination). It has been shown that integration of ChR2 into various tissues of mice can activate neural circuits, control heart muscle contractions, and even restore breathing after spinal cord injury. More compellingly, a plethora of evidence has indicated that artificial expression of ChR2 in retinal ganglion cells can reinstate visual perception in mice with retinal degeneration.",

The LPG also displayed high binding affinity towards commercial-grade synthetic zeolite, silica and silica-containing materials. A commercial sample of the truncated Protein G and a basic protein, both without the linker, did not bind to natural or synthetic zeolites or silica.

These enzymes are able to catalyze the polycondensation and deposition of silica at mild conditions. Silicateins can be expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant proteins are expressed on the surface of the cell wall and are able to catalyze the formation of a polysilicate net around the bacterial cells providing the possibility for further attachment to the surface of SiO2 containing sensor chips. With this mild immobilization process it is now possible to prepare novel microbial sensors based on Optical Waveguide Lightmode Spectroscopy.In the present study, the immobilization of silicatein modified E. coli BL21AI cells onto the SiO2-type chips was optimized (buffer concentration, pH, temperature, reaction time, and so on) and then the biological properties, in particular the inhibitory effect of stressors/environmental pollutants on the novel bacterial sensor were studied in real time.The effect of oxidative stress was investigated by exposing the sensors containing biosilica-immobilized E. coli BL21AI cells to various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. The effect of antibiotics was tested using chloramphenicol (CAP) which is effective against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and penicillin G which destroys the bacterial cell wall. In addition, the inhibition by carbofuran (CF) pesticide was also tested. CF is a highly toxic compound which inhibits cholinesterase activity. According our results we can conclude that the novel bacterial sensor consisting of the silicatein modified E. coli BL21AI cells immobilized on OWLS sensor surface could be an effective tool to detect the presence of different type of pollutants in real time measurement.

     "abstract": "Hierarchical meso-macroporous silica (average mesopore diameter 20 nm) was synthesized and chemically modified to be used as a support for the immobilization of lipases from Candida antarctica B and Alcaligenes sp. and β-galactosidases from Bacillus circulans and Aspergillus oryzae. Catalytic activities and thermal stabilities of enzymes immobilized by multipoint covalent attachment in silica derivatized with glyoxyl groups were compared with those immobilized in glyoxyl-agarose, assessing biocatalyst performance under non-reactive conditions in aqueous medium. In the case of A. oryzae β-galactosidase and Alcaligenes sp. lipase, an additional step of amination was needed to improve immobilization yield. Specific activities of lipases immobilized in glyoxyl-silica were high (232 and 62 IU per gram, for C. antarctica B and Alcaligenes sp. respectively); thermal stabilities were higher than those immobilized in glyoxyl-agarose. Although in the case of β-galactosidases from B. circulans and A. oryzae, the specific activities (250 and 310 IU per gram, respectively) were lower than the ones obtained with glyoxyl-agarose, expressed activities were similar to values previously reported. Thermal stabilities of both β-galactosidases immobilized in glyoxyl-silica were higher than when glyoxyl-agarose was used as support. Results indicate that hierarchical meso-macroporous silica is a versatile support for the production of robust biocatalysts.",

The Caco-2 cell-based intestinal epithelium model is widely used for this purpose for low molecular mass drugs. The aim of this study was to test the suitability of the Caco-2 model for assessing enhanced transepithelial permeability to proteins. Four unrelated proteins were chosen to test the permeability of Caco-2 monolayers. It was found that proteins could cross the epithelium model, in spite of their size. All tested proteins had similar very low apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) of around 4 × 10−10 cm/s. Protein stability over three-hour exposure to Caco-2 was also confirmed. Their crossing rate in a cell-free setup was also measured, to determine the upper limit of permeability to proteins. An epithelium permeability enhancer N-decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (MP C10) was used to demonstrate accelerated permeability conditions. Papp values could be increased dose dependently up to about 1 × 10−7 cm/s, close to the level in the cell-free setup, indicating distinctive potential of the model. This along with enhancing effect of known specific route permeators suggests involvement of the paracellular route in protein transport. Our results thus indicate that the Caco-2 model is a suitable tool for in vitro assessment of enhanced permeability to proteins.",

A flor-forming S. cerevisiae strain was also immobilized, while a non-flocculating strain colonized the pellets but was not immobilized. No adverse effects were detected as a result of the close proximity between the filamentous fungus and the yeast, which potentially allows for co-fermentation with S. cerevisiae immobilized in pellets of zygomycetes.",

Ten transformants producing XynB representing each of the four different types of vectors were selected for further testing and the highest XynB production was achieved from a transformant containing 1–2 copies of the EGL2cbmlin vector. Best xylanase producers did not show any particular pattern in terms of the number of gene copies and their mode of integration into the chromosomal DNA. Transformants generated with the cbmlin-type vectors produced multiple forms of XynB which were decorated with various N- and O-glycans.

Here, we establish a convenient method to synthesize large amounts of functional human aquaglyceroporin 3 protein (AQP3), an AQP of physiological relevance conducting glycerol and some small neutral solutes besides water. Milligram amounts of AQP3 were produced as a histidine-tagged protein (hAQP3-6His) in an Escherichia coli extract-based CF system in the presence of the non-ionic detergent Brij-98. The recombinant AQP3 was purified by affinity chromatography, incorporated into liposomes and evaluated functionally by stopped-flow light scattering. Correct protein folding was indicated by the high glycerol and water permeability exhibited by the hAQP3-6His proteoliposomes as compared to empty control liposomes. Functionality of hAQP3-6His was further confirmed by the strong inhibition of the glycerol and water permeability by phloretin and HgCl2, respectively, two blockers of AQP3. Fast and convenient CF production of functional AQP3 may serve as basis for further structural/functional assessment of aquaglyceroporins and help boosting the AQP-based biomimetic technologies.",

We show that KLPGWSG binds molecules expressed on the cell surface of murine adult neural stem cells, thus may potentially be involved in stem cell fate determination. Indeed we demonstrated that this peptide in solution enhances per se cell differentiation toward the neuronal phenotype. Hence, we synthesized two LDLK-12-based self-assembling peptides functionalized with KLPGWSG peptide (KLP and Ac-KLP) and characterized them via atomic force microscopy, rheometry and circular dichroism, obtaining nanostructured hydrogels supporting murine neural stem cells differentiation in vitro. Interestingly, we demonstrated that, when scaffold stiffness is comparable to that of the brain in vivo, the Ac-KLP SAP-based scaffold enhances the neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells. These evidences place both KLPGWSG and the functionalized self-assembling peptide Ac-KLP as promising candidates for, respectively, biomimetic studies and stem cell therapies for nervous regeneration.",

In the present work, the effect of the time-consuming step of gradual cell adaptation to serum-free conditions on the glycosylation profile of a mAb produced by CHO-K1 cells was evaluated. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed important changes in mAb glycosylation patterns in all steps of serum reduction. These changes could be grouped in two distinct phases of the process of adaptation: middle (2.5 to 0.15% serum) and final (0.075 and 0% serum). For intermediate levels of serum, a desirable increase of galactosylation and decrease of fucosylation, but an undesirable increase in sialylation were observed; while the inverse was obtained at the final stages of adaptation. These divergences may be related to the reduction of serum supplementation, to variations in the levels of cell density and viability achieved at these stages, and to the natural shift of the cell growth mode during adaptation from adherent to suspended. The divergent glycan profiles obtained in this study demonstrate a strong influence of the adaptation process on mAb glycosylation, suggesting that control and monitoring of product quality should be implemented at the early stages of process development.",

Improved biogas production in septic tanks is crucial to increase the potential of this system for both energy generation and organic matter removal. In this study, the effect on the biogas production and biogas quality of coupling a 20 L lab-scale septic tank with a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) was investigated and compared with a standard septic tank. Both reactors were operated at a volumetric organic loading rate of 0.5 gCOD/L d and a hydraulic retention time between 20 and 40 days using black water as an input under mesophilic conditions for a period of 3 months. The MEC-septic tank was operated at an applied voltage of 2.0 ± 0.1 V and the current experienced ranged from 40 mA (0.9 A/m2 projected electrode area) to 180 mA (5 A/m2 projected electrode area). The COD removal was of the order of 85% and the concentration of residual COD was not different between both reactors. Yet, the total phosphorous in the output was on average 39% lower in the MEC-septic tank. Moreover, the biogas production rate in the MEC-septic tank was a factor of 5 higher than in the control reactor and the H2S concentration in the biogas was a factor of 2.5 lower. The extra electricity supplied to the MEC-septic tank was recovered as extra biogas produced. Overall, it appears that the combination of MEC and a septic tank offers perspectives in terms of lower discharge of phosphorus and H2S, nutrient recuperation and a more reliable supply of biogas.",

A self-assessment showed that a majority of respondents felt more familiar with the climate change than the biotechnology debate. Even though the survey results reveal that most respondents consider the potential of modern biotechnology to address climate change to be substantial, the policy network analysis revealed that one stakeholder who is not just considered to be relevant in both debates but also crucial in the formation of global public opinion, strongly rejects the view that biotechnology is a climate-friendly and therefore clean technology.

     "abstract": "Despite the fact that a thorough, lengthy and costly evaluation of genetically engineered (GE) crop plants (including compositional analysis and toxicological tests) is imposed before marketing some European citizens remain sceptical of the safety of GE food and feed. In this context, are additional tests necessary? If so, what can we learn from them? To address these questions, we examined data from 60 recent high-throughput ‘-omics’ comparisons between GE and non-GE crop lines and 17 recent long-term animal feeding studies (longer than the classical 90-day subchronic toxicological tests), as well as 16 multigenerational studies on animals. The ‘-omics’ comparisons revealed that the genetic modification has less impact on plant gene expression and composition than that of conventional plant breeding. Moreover, environmental factors (such as field location, sampling time, or agricultural practices) have a greater impact than transgenesis. None of these ‘-omics’ profiling studies has raised new safety concerns about GE varieties; neither did the long-term and multigenerational studies on animals. Therefore, there is no need to perform such long-term studies in a case-by-case approach, unless reasonable doubt still exists after conducting a 90-day feeding test. In addition, plant compositional analysis and ‘-omics’ profiling do not indicate that toxicological tests should be mandatory. We discuss what complementary fundamental studies should be performed and how to choose the most efficient experimental design to assess risks associated with new GE traits. The possible need to update the current regulatory framework is discussed.",

The increase in the capacity of next generation sequencing systems will enable the high-throughput analysis of a large number of individuals generating huge amounts of genome, epigenome and transcriptome data, but making it feasible to apply deep sequencing in the clinic to characterise not only the patient's genome, but also individual samples, for example, from tumours. The genome profile will be integrated with proteome and metabolome information generated via new powerful chromatography, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.

Indeed, it has been suggested that there is no human ‘ageing process’, only distinct, disease-specific mechanisms of pathology.However, humans are not the only organisms within the biosphere to show ageing and the use of cross-species approaches has demonstrated that common ageing processes exist and allowed some of the common genetic pathways controlling them to be identified.

Genetic and epigenetic studies on HCC may help to understand better its mechanisms and provide new tools for early diagnosis and therapy. Recent literature on whole genome analysis of HCC indicated a high number of mutated genes in addition to well-known genes such as TP53, CTNNB1, AXIN1 and CDKN2A, but their frequencies are much lower. Apart from CTNNB1 mutations, most of the other mutations appear to result in loss-of-function. Thus, HCC-associated mutations cannot be easily targeted for therapy. Epigenetic aberrations that appear to occur quite frequently may serve as new targets. Global DNA hypomethylation, promoter methylation, aberrant expression of non-coding RNAs and dysregulated expression of other epigenetic regulatory genes such as EZH2 are the best-known epigenetic abnormalities.

Along with favorable properties such as growth to high cell density and high capacities for protein secretion, P. pastoris provides a strong, methanol inducible promoter of the alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) gene. The regulation of this promoter has been extensively studied in recent years by characterizing cis-acting sequence elements and trans-acting factors, revealing insights into underlying molecular mechanisms. However, new alternative promoters have also been identified and characterized by means of their transcriptional regulation and feasibility for protein production using P. pastoris. Besides the often applied GAP promoter, these include a variety of constitutive promoters from housekeeping genes (e.g. TEF1, PGK1, TPI1) and inducible promoters from particular biochemical pathways (e.g. PHO89, THI11, AOD). In addition to these promoter sequence/function based studies, transcriptional regulation has also been investigated by characterizing transcription factors (TFs) and their modes of controlling bioprocess relevant traits. TFs involved in such diverse cellular processes such as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hac1p), iron uptake (Fep1p) and oxidative stress response (Yap1p) have been studied.

The introduction of new technologies has enabled researchers to utilize novel study designs to tackle previously unexplored research questions in human genomics. These new types of studies typically need large sample sizes to overcome the multiple testing challenges caused by the huge number of interrogated genetic variants. As a consequence, large consortia-studies are at present the default in disease genetics research. The systematic planning of the GWA-studies was a key element in the success of the approach. Similar planning and rigor in statistical inferences will probably be beneficial also to future sequencing studies.

In spite of the clear benefits, the method has proven to be more challenging than anticipated. In the case of complex diseases, next-generation sequencing aims to identify disease-associated low-frequency alleles. However, their robust detection will require very large study samples, even larger than in the case of the GWA-studies. This has stimulated study designs that capitalize on enriching sets of low-frequency alleles, for example, studies focusing on population isolates such as Finland or Iceland. One example is the collaborative SISu Project (Sequencing Initiative Suomi) that aims to provide near complete genome variation information from Finnish study samples and pave the way for large, nationwide genome health initiative studies.",

In brief, I believe this programme has punched above its weight, and that it has successfully contributed to the overall organisation of molecular biosciences in Europe. With a modest annual budget the programme has created several interesting new opportunities, some of which may have yet to show their full impact.

The primary aim of such modulation is the correction of genetic defects by alteration of the resulting protein such that the dysfunction is reduced or relieved. This application is in several clinical phase III trails, notably for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and earlier clinical trials are in preparation for other diseases, a.o. spinal muscular atrophy. An alternative aim may be to disrupt the reading frame of dysfunctional proteins when they have a dominant negative effect and their absence may ameliorate disease. A third aim is to target mRNAs for other proteins, the engineering of which might improve or prevent the disease. A final application, which is as yet under-explored but has major promise, is the functional in vivo study of protein isoforms by modulating their relative levels by AON-based skipping of alternative exons.",

This enables the selective impairment of gene function. During the past decade RNAi has been exploited in many different eukaryotic cell types and model organisms. Large-scale and eventually genome-wide RNAi screens ablating gene functions in a systematic manner have delivered an overwhelming amount of data on the requirement of distinct gene products for major cellular pathways. A large part of the RNAi field is dedicated to disease states such as cancer or infection with the prospect of discovering pathways suitable for new therapeutic interventions.

     "publication date": "01-2013",
     "abstract": "Knowledge and technology transfer to African laboratories and farmers is an important objective for achieving food security and sustainable crop production on the sub-Saharan African continent. Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a vital source of calories for more than a billion people in developing countries, and its potential industrial use for starch and bioethanol in the tropics is increasingly being recognized. However, cassava production remains constrained by the susceptibility of the crop to several biotic and abiotic stresses. For more than a decade, biotechnology has been considered an attractive tool to improve cassava as it substantially circumvents the limitations of traditional breeding, which is particularly time-consuming and tedious because of the high heterozygosity of the crop. A major constraint to the development of biotechnological approaches for cassava improvement has been the lack of an efficient and robust transformation and regeneration system. Despite some success achieved in genetic modification of the model cassava cultivar Tropical Manihot Series (TMS), TMS 60444, in some European and U.S. laboratories, the lack of a reproducible and robust protocol has not allowed the establishment of a routine transformation system in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we optimized a robust and efficient protocol developed at ETH Zurich to successfully establish transformation of a commercially cultivated South African landrace, T200, and compared this with the benchmark model cultivar TMS 60444. Results from our study demonstrated high transformation rates for both T200 (23 transgenic lines from 100 friable embryogenic callus (FEC) clusters) compared with TMS 60444 (32 transgenic lines from 100 FEC clusters). The success in transforming landraces or farmer-preferred cultivars has been limited, and the high transformation rate of an industry-preferred landrace in this study is encouraging for a feasible transformation program for cassava improvement in South Africa (SA), which can potentially be extended to other countries in southern Africa. The successful establishment of a robust cassava transformation and regeneration system in SA demonstrates the relevance of technology transfer to sub-Saharan Africa and highlights the importance of developing suitable and reliable techniques before their transfer to laboratories offering less optimal conditions.",

     "abstract": "While antibodies currently play a dominant role as affinity reagents in biological research and for diagnostics, a broad range of recombinant proteins are emerging as promising alternative affinity reagents in detection assays and quantification. DNA-mediated affinity-based assays, such as immuno-PCR and proximity ligation assays (PLA), use oligonucleotides attached to affinity reagents as reporter molecules. Conjugation of oligonucleotides to affinity reagents generally employs chemistries that target primary amines or cysteines. Because of the random nature of these processes neither the number of oligonucleotides conjugated per molecule nor their sites of attachment can be accurately controlled for affinity reagents with several available amines and cysteines. Here, we present a straightforward and convenient approach to functionalize recombinant affinity reagents for PLA by expressing the reagents as fusion partners with SNAP protein tags. This allowed us to conjugate oligonucleotides in a site-specific fashion, yielding precisely one oligonucleotide per affinity reagent. We demonstrate this method using designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) recognizing the tumor antigen HER2 and we apply the conjugates in different assay formats. We also show that SNAP or CLIP tags, expressed as fusion partners of transfected genes, allow oligonucleotide conjugations to be performed in fixed cells, with no need for specific affinity reagents. The approach is used to demonstrate induced interactions between the fusion proteins FKBP and FRB by allowing the in situ conjugated oligonucleotides to direct the production of templates for localized rolling circle amplification reactions.",

The mutated CBHI was tagged fluorescently with Venus to establish the subcellular location of the fusion protein and its potential association with the proteasome, an organelle assigned for the disposal of misfolded proteins. Expression of the mutant CBHI in the high protein-secreting host Rut-C30 caused physiological changes in the fungal hyphae, affected protein secretion and elicited ER stress. A massive upregulation of UPR- and ERAD-related genes sec61, der1, uba1, bip1, pdi1, prp1, cxl1 and lhs1 was observed by qRT-PCR in the CBHIΔ4-Venus strain with four mutations introduced in the DNA encoding the core domain of CBHI. Further stress was applied to this strain by inhibiting function of the proteasome with MG132 (N-benzoylcarbonyl(Cbz)-Leu-Leu-leucinal). The effect of MG132 was found to be specific to the proteasome-associated genes. There are no earlier reports on the effect of proteasome inhibition on protein quality control in filamentous fungi. Confocal fluorescence microscopy studies suggested that the mutant CBHI accumulated in the ER and colocalized with the fungal proteasome.

Glucose, GSH precursors amino acids, as well as other cofactors, were dissolved in a biotransformation solution and yeast cells were added (5%dcw). Two response surface central composite designs (RSCCDs) were performed in sequence: in the first step the influence of amino acid composition (cysteine, glycine, glutamic acid and serine) on GSH accumulation was investigated; once their formulation was set up, the influence of other components was studied. Initial GSH content was found 0.53 and 0.47%dcw for compressed and dried forms. GSH accumulation ability of baker's yeast in compressed form was higher at the beginning of shelf life, that is, in the first week, and a maximum of 2.04%dcw was obtained. Performance of yeast in dried form was not found satisfactory, as the maximum GSH level was 1.18%dcw. When cysteine lacks from the reaction solution, yeast cells do not accumulate GSH. With dried yeast, the highest GSH yields occurred when cysteine was set at 3 g/L, glycine and glutamic acid at least at 4 g/L, without serine. Employing compressed yeast, the highest GSH yields occurred when cysteine and glutamic acid were set at 2–3 g/L, while glycine and serine higher than 2 g/L. Results allowed to set up an optimal and feasible procedure to obtain GSH-enriched yeast biomass, with up to threefold increase with respect to initial content.",

     "abstract": "Biomass with denitrifying phosphate uptake ability was tested under sequencing anaerobic–aerobic and anaerobic–anoxic conditions. The initial dose of acetate, under anaerobic conditions varied to achieve different PHA (poly-hydroxyalkanoates) saturation of PAO (polyphosphate accumulating organisms) cells. Increased acetate dosage under anaerobic conditions led to higher phosphate release and increased PHA storage by PAOs and, also, to greater phosphate uptake rates under the following aerobic and/or anoxic conditions. The experimental results also indicated that when organic carbon is limited under anaerobic conditions, more internal glycogen supplementary to polyphosphate cleavage is utilized by the biomass, resulting in less phosphate release and more PHA stored per acetate taken up. In the subsequent aerobic and/or anoxic phase PAOs demonstrate an improved EBPR (enhanced biological phosphorus removal) performance, with regard to PHA consumption per phosphate taken up, for reduced initial biomass PHA content under both aerobic and anoxic conditions. The examination of EBPR biomass under controlled operational conditions, where experimental analysis of the relevant compounds in the bulk phase (PO43−, NO3− and/or O2) in conjunction with the biomass intracellular products (PHA, glycogen), contributes to an improved understanding of the PAOs metabolic behavior, with regard to organic substrate availability.",

     "abstract": "Lactate production is monitored in industrial processes as a crucial metabolite for cultured mammalian cells. Typically lactate is strongly produced during the exponential growth phase, while its net consumption is frequently observed when cells enter into the stationary phase. Such a metabolic shift is desirable because it seems to favor optimal process performance. However, this shift is neither generic nor can it be easily controlled, as the mechanisms modulating lactate production/consumption in cell culture are still under investigation.In this study different lactate profiles were observed in a chemically defined medium for the parental CHO-S cells and a non-recombinant subclone. The initial lactate production phase, which is typical for fast growing cells, was similar for both cell lines. After glutamine depletion the situation changed: the parental cell line promptly switched to net lactate consumption, whereas the subclone continued to produce lactate until glucose was depleted as well.We speculated that the extra lactate production would be ascribed to a different mitochondrial oxidative capacity in the subclone. Therefore, the mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption were measured for both cell lines. Indeed, a correlation between high lactate production and a reduced oxidative metabolism was found.Interestingly, this particular metabolic phenotype was also strongly influenced by the medium composition: both cell lines underwent a switch to lactate consumption when cultivated in a second medium, while a third one promoted continuous lactate production even for the parental CHO cells. Again, the correlation between lactate profile and oxidative metabolism was confirmed, pointing to a central role of mitochondria on lactate metabolism.",

     "abstract": "Recombinant protein production significantly improved in the past three decades. Novel expression systems were developed, growth conditions optimised and the technology and thus monitoring and analysis significantly enhanced. However, the studies of bacterial cell disruption were more or less neglected.The existing methods were acceptable until the final product of protein production was soluble and pure protein. However recently, inclusion bodies (IBs) as whole protein particles were also recognised as the final product. Classical methods for bacterial cell disruption are therefore not always suitable, sufficient or even appropriate for isolation of such particulate material. Some of the currently existing methods for bacterial cell disruption were recognised as damaging for the structure of IBs, while sonication was even found harmful for the recombinant protein. The powers needed for disruption of the bacterial cells damage the recombinant proteins and thus their biological activity significantly reduces.Furthermore, the classical isolation methods enable disruption of majority of the bacterial cells and this is enough for isolation of soluble proteins, yet it is not adequate for isolation of particulate material. While remaining bacterial cells sediment together with the IBs, they represent impurity. The need for isolation of cell-free IBs was therefore revealed in the recent studies, because only pure IBs can be used as nanoparticles in further biomedical applications.Therefore it is time to consider, redesign, optimise or even develop new alternative methods that would enable isolation of pure, structurally intact and biologically active particles. Two such alternative methods that enable isolation of bacterial free, active protein particles were developed recently.",

     "abstract": "Escherichia coli strains are widely used as host for the production of recombinant proteins. Compared to E. coli K12, E. coli BL21 (DE3) has several biotechnological advantages, such as a lower acetate yield and a higher biomass yield, which have a beneficial effect on protein production. In a previous study (BMC Microbiol. 2011, 11:70) we have altered the metabolic fluxes of a K12 strain (i.e. E. coli MG1655) by deleting the regulators ArcA and IclR in such a way that the biomass yield is remarkably increased, while the acetate production is decreased to a similar value as for BL21 (DE3). In this study we show that the increased biomass yield beneficially influences recombinant protein production as a higher GFP yield was observed for the double knockout strain compared to its wild type. However, at higher cell densities (>2 g L−1 CDW), the GFP concentration decreases again, due to the activity of proteases which obstructs the application of the strain in high cell density cultivations. By further deleting the genes lon and ompT, which encode for proteases, this degradation could be reduced. Consequently, higher GFP yields were observed in the quadruple knockout strain as opposed to the double knockout strain and the MG1655 wild type and its yield approximates the GFP yield of E. coli BL21 (DE3), that is, 27 ± 5 mg g CDW − 1 vs. 30 ± 5 mg g CDW − 1 , respectively.",

This occurs through the over-expression of the noncoding small RNA SgrS, which interacts specifically with the mRNA of the ptsG gene and prevents its translation. However, when these bacteria are exposed to a glucose concentration of 40 g/L, over-expression of SgrS is observed only in E. coli B (BL21). Unlike E. coli K-12 (JM109 and MG1655), which are affected by high glucose concentration and produce higher levels of acetate, E. coli B (BL21) is not affected. Based on this information, it was assumed that over-expression of SgrS enables E. coli B (BL21) to reduce its acetate excretion by controlling the glucose transport. When SgrS was over-expressed in both E. coli K-12 strains from a multicopy plasmid, it was possible to reduce their acetate excretion levels to those seen in E. coli B. This observation opens a new approach towards controlling bacterial metabolism through the use of noncoding RNA.",

     "abstract": "Phytoremediation and phycoremediation are cost-effective and environmentally sound technologies for the treatment of polluted streams and wastewaters contaminated with metals. Currently, the most commonly used parameter to assess the metal uptake of biomass is (q) expressed as mg metal g dry weight−1. By contrast, the bioconcentration factor (BCF) is one of the most widely used factors to evaluate the metal uptake capacity of macrophytes. However, both parameters the metal uptake (q) and the BCF cannot be applied to differentiate between the ability of live plants or photosynthetic microorganisms to adsorb the metal onto their surface through passive mechanisms or to accumulate the contaminant at intracellular level through metabolically active mechanisms. This mini review has the objective of discussing the need to differentiate between bioadsorption and bioaccumulation of metals in live plants and photosynthetic microorganisms used in phytofiltration and phycoremediation processes, respectively. The use of two specific factors, the bioadsorption factor (BAF) and the intracellular accumulation factor (IAF) that have been previously reported in order to make a clear differentiation between these two metal removal mechanisms in Salvinia minima and Leptolyngbya crossbyana is highlighted. It is suggested that the BAF and the IAF can be used in phytofiltration wetlands and phycoremediation lagoons, where there is the need of specific information indicating the fate of the metal in order to gain information about possible removal mechanisms. These factors could also provide a tool to decide whether it is possible to harvest the biomass and to recover a fair amount of metal adsorbed onto the surface by means of desorbent agents. A critical assessment of the use of EDTA as desorbent agent is also included.",

     "abstract": "Phytoremediation consists in treating environmental pollutions through the use of plants and their associated microbes. Phytoremediation can be used for pollutant stabilization, extraction, degradation or volatilization. Cadmium is one of the most toxic trace metallic elements for living organisms and its accumulation in the environment is recognized as a worldwide concern. Plants suitable for efficient pollutant extraction from the soil should combine different characteristics like fast growth, high biomass, high tolerance and high accumulation capacities in harvestable parts. A rare class of plants called hyperaccumulators combines extremely high tolerance degrees and foliar accumulation of trace elements. With regard to cadmium, none of the Cd hyperaccumulators identified has met the criteria for efficient phytoextraction so far. By virtue of genetic engineering it is possible to transfer genes involved in Cd tolerance or accumulation in high biomass plants. Nevertheless, the genetic determinants of Cd hyperaccumulation are far from being understood. It is thus indispensable to acquire more knowledge about these processes. Among Cd hyperaccumulators, Arabidopsis halleri (some populations can hyperaccumulate Cd) is considered as a model species for the study of metal homeostasis and detoxification. This review will summarize our knowledge about Cd tolerance and accumulation acquired in A. halleri and how this knowledge may be used in phytoextraction.",

Physicochemical methods of pollutant removal are difficult and prohibitively expensive. Using biological systems such as microorganisms, plants, or consortia microorganisms–plants is easier, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly. The aim of this study was to isolate, characterize and identify microorganisms from contaminated soil and to find out the effect of plants on microbial diversity in the environment. Microorganisms were isolated by two approaches with the aim to find all cultivable species and those able to utilise biphenyl as a sole source of carbon and energy. The first approach was direct extraction and the second was isolation of bacteria after enrichment cultivation with biphenyl. Isolates were biochemically characterized by NEFERMtest 24 and then the composition of ribosomal proteins in bacterial cells was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Ribosomal proteins can be used as phylogenetic markers and thus MALDI-TOF MS can be exploited also for taxonomic identification because the constitution of ribosomal proteins in bacterial cells is specific for each bacterial species. Identification of microorganisms using this method is performed with the help of database Bruker Daltonics MALDI BioTyper. Isolated bacteria were analyzed from the point of the bphA gene presence. Bacteria with detected bphA gene were then taxonomically identified by 16S rRNA sequence.The ability of two different plant species, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and nightshade (Solanum nigrum), to accumulate PCBs was studied as well. It was determined that various plant species differ in the PCBs accumulation from the contaminated soil. Also the content of PCBs in various plant tissues was compared.

     "abstract": "Bioelectrochemical systems (BES) are increasingly being considered for bioremediation applications, such as the reductive transformation of chlorinated hydrocarbons in subsurface environments. These systems typically rely on a polarized solid-state electrode (i.e. a cathode) serving as electron donor for the microbially catalyzed reductive dechlorination of chlorinated contaminants. The microorganisms involved in dechlorinating biocathodes are not still identified. Particularly, it is not clear whether the same microorganisms responsible for the reductive dechlorination in ‘conventional’ bioremediation systems (i.e. those based on the supply of soluble substrates as electron donors) also play a role in BES. Here, we analyzed by CARD-FISH, the microbial composition of a dechlorinating biocathode operated at different set potential, in the range from −250 mV to −750 mV (vs. the standard hydrogen electrode, SHE). The rate and extent of TCE dechlorination, as well as of competing metabolisms (i.e. methanogenesis), were found to increase as the cathode potential decreased. The higher metabolic activities observed at the more reducing cathode potentials were mirrored by a higher total biomass concentration (as DAPI-stained cells) in the cathode effluent. CARD-FISH analysis revealed that Dehalococcoides was the dominant dechlorinating bacterial genus (from 65% to 100% of Bacteria) in the range from −550 mV to −750 mV, whereas it was abruptly outcompeted by other (yet unidentified) members of the Chloroflexi phylum, when the cathode was controlled in the range from −250 mV to −450 mV. Most probably, the observed changes in the microbial composition of the biocathode were driven by changes in the dominant mechanisms of electron transfer to TCE: mediated by the electrolytic production of H2 gas (in the range from −550 mV to −750 mV), or direct (in the range of cathode potentials from −250 mV to −450 mV).",

Batch kinetic biodegradation tests were performed in both single- and two-phase modes, and the Haldane equation kinetic parameters were estimated (k = 1.3 × 10−2 mgDCP mgVSS−1 h−1, KI = 35 mgDCP L−1 and Ks = 18 mgDCP L−1), confirming the highly toxic nature of DCP. Consistent with these findings, operation of the single-phase system showed that for an initial DCP concentration of 130 mg L−1 the biomass was completely inhibited and DCP was not degraded, while the two-phase system achieved near-complete DCP removal. In sequencing batch mode the TPPB had a removal efficiency of 91% within 500 min for a feed of 320 mg L−1, which exceeds the highest concentration previously degraded. These results have confirmed the effectiveness of the use of small amounts (5%, v/v) of inexpensive commercial polymers as the partitioning phase in TPPB reactors for the treatment of a highly toxic substrate at influent loads that are prohibitive for conventional single-phase operation, and suggest that similar detoxification of wastewater influents is achievable for other target cytotoxic substrates.",

     "abstract": "Chlorophenols exert a crucial effect on the methanogenesis, considerably reducing both maximum methane potential and methanogenic rates. However, there is not enough information about the kinetic mechanism of chlorophenols toxicity on the methanogenesis, which is a key aspect for the control of the anaerobic digesters because of the sensitivity and the potential for energy recovery derived from methane release. The International Water Association-Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (IWA-ADM1) can be adapted to a wide range of situations by updating or changing the equations in the model. The present study proposes a general kinetic model for methanogenesis. This model has been applied to predict the inhibition of methanogenesis by chlorophenols, and it can be used for updating the IWA-ADM1 when treating inhibitory compounds. The model was calibrated and validated using a wide broad of experimental sets of data of methane production by granular sludge in the presence of 2,4-dichlorophenol (24DCP), 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (246TCP) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) in batch assays. A lag-phase of the effect of chlorophenols on the methanogenesis by non-adapted sludge was detected and modeled by the kinetic model proposed. In addition, the inhibitory effect of PCP was more pronounced on the acetoclastic methanogenesis than on the hydrogenotrophic one. Non-competitive and uncompetitive inhibition types were detected using 24DCP and 246TCP, whereas a suicide or irreversible inhibition type was observed in the case of PCP. Values of inhibition constants considerably varied depending on the chlorophenol used, between 45 mg 24DCP L−1, 41–51 mg 246TCP L−1 and 0.9–7.8 mg PCP L−1. The higher toxicity of PCP is related with its hydrophobicity, which was determined by adsorption tests and using partition coefficients n-octanol/water.

In this context, G+ bacterium Rhodococcus erythropolis, which has a wide potential for biodegradation of aromatic compounds, was studied. High surface hydrophobicity of its cells, given mainly by the presence of mycolic acids in the cell envelopes, allows formation of stable biofilms.

Higher concentrations of both biphenyl- and chlorobenzoate-degrading cultivable bacteria were found in the MS-amended microcosms (MSM) than the non amended or SO-amended ones after 30 d incubation at 28°C. Fungal growth, instead, was strikingly stimulated in the microcosms that had undergone concomitant MS and SO supplementation (MS-SOM). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses of 16S and 18S rRNA genes showed that both amendments promoted a remarkable increase in both bacterial and fungal biodiversity. The abundances of biphenyl-2,3-dioxygenase (bph) and that of catechol-2,3-dioxygenase (C230) genes in the non-amended contaminated soil were constant over time. Conversely, after 60 d incubation, bph and C230 abundances increased 2.8- and 61-fold in the MSM, respectively, and, in the MS-SOM, 1.4- and 46-fold, respectively, with respect to the zero time point. Although the overall PCB removal was not positively affected by the amendments, the concomitant presence of both MS and SO led to significantly higher depletions of hexa-, hepta-, octa- and nona-chlorinated congeners than in the non-amended microcosms (i.e. 24.6, 22, 20.5 and 9.5%, versus 19.4, 16.4, 14.7 and 6.1%, respectively). In all microcosms, PCB degradation was negatively correlated with hydrophobicity, organic matter/water partition coefficient, molecular weight and extent of chlorination of the pollutants with the notable exception of the MS-SOM ones where such a relationship was less stringent.",

We succeeded in elucidating an unusual pathway involving an attack at the quaternary alpha-carbon atom of the substrate, a position previously thought to be highly resistant to biodegradation. Combining analytical and bioanalytical methods, a good understanding of the reaction mechanisms, the enzymes catalysing them and the organization of the genes encoding them could be gained. First studies on the use of Sphingomonas sp. strain TTNP3 in wastewater treatment have been performed revealing promising results.",

An optimized formulation of immobilized biocatalysts is therefore of strategic interest in the field of industrial biotechnology. Nevertheless, biocatalyst formulation still largely relies on empirical approaches which lack effectiveness in the identification of optimum immobilization conditions.In the present study, design of experiments, multiple linear regressions and modeling were used to screen, interpret and finally optimize crucial immobilization parameters. A laccase preparation from Coriolopsis polyzona MUCL38443 was immobilized via a sequential adsorption-crosslinking process on mesoporous silica particles. As a target variable, biocatalyst activity was doubled (∼280 U g−1) while dramatically reducing processing time (two hours instead of 26 hours) and reagent inputs (80 mm instead of 1 m glutaraldehyde (GLU)). Immobilization yield (∼50%) and thermostability (∼60% residual activity after 24 hours at 45°C) could be maintained under the optimized conditions.As an example of its application in environmental biotechnology, the optimized biocatalyst was implemented in a continuous stirred-tank membrane reactor (CSTMR) to continuously degrade the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA) in wastewater. A 90% removal of 50 μm BPA was achieved over 30 reactor volumes (hydraulic residence time (HRT) of 1.85 hours, 50 mL working volume).",

It becomes increasingly apparent that to deliver the promise of personalised treatments, more and more novel medicines discovered today will be presented together with innovative companion diagnostics.The contributions to this volume touch on many disciplines, ranging from cell biology to genetics, immunology, molecular diagnostics, pharmaceutics and economic issues. The contributions of clinicians and basic scientists are synergistically presented to underline better the wide spectrum of studies that can contribute to the new field of personalised medicine. The promising perspectives of individualised treatments are related not only to higher effectiveness, but also to increased efficiency. This is relevant not only for the individual patient, but even more so for the general public, within a wider economical perspective where resources are limited and it becomes more and more mandatory to close the gap between social costs and benefits. This approach follows the steps of a stratified and individualised medicine and finds its final goal in an individualised healthcare.",

Systems biology – holistic, global and integrative in approach – has given rise to systems medicine, a systems approach to health and disease. Systems medicine promises to (1) provide deep insights into disease mechanisms, (2) make blood a diagnostic window for viewing health and disease for the individual, (3) stratify complex diseases into their distinct subtypes for a impedance match against proper drugs, (4) provide new approaches to drug target discovery and (5) generate metrics for assessing wellness. P4 medicine, the clinical face of systems medicine, has two major objectives: to quantify wellness and to demystify disease. Patients and consumers will be a major driver in the realization of P4 medicine through their participation in medically oriented social networks directed at improving their own healthcare. P4 medicine has striking implications for society – including the ability to turn around the ever-escalating costs of healthcare. The challenge in bringing P4 medicine to patients and consumers is twofold: first, inventing the strategies and technologies that will enable P4 medicine and second, dealing with the impact of P4 medicine on society – including key ethical, social, legal, regulatory, and economic issues. Managing the societal problems will pose the most significant challenges. Strategic partnerships of a variety of types will be necessary to bring P4 medicine to patients.",

Key factors in the development of technologies for personalised medicine are standardisation, integration and harmonisation. For example, the tools and processes for data collection and analysis must be standardised across research sites. Research activity at different sites must be integrated to maximise synergies, and scientific research must be integrated with healthcare to ensure effective translation. There must also be harmonisation between scientific practices in different research sites, between science and healthcare and between science, healthcare and wider society, including the ethical and regulatory frameworks, the prevailing political and cultural ethos and the expectations of patients/citizens.",

Companion diagnostics serves to support early drug development, it can provide surrogate markers in clinical trials, and also guide selection of individual therapies and monitoring of responses in routine clinical care. The era of companion diagnostics can be said to have begun with the introduction of the HercepTest – a first-of-a-kind diagnostic tool developed by DakoCytomation in 1998 to select patients for therapy with the anticancer drug Herceptin (trastuzumab). Herceptin and the paired test proved that companion diagnostics can help guide patient-tailored therapies.

Predictive biomarkers are defined by biological characteristics of the patient's or tumor status that can be measured objectively and correlated with clinical outcome: these can be molecular, cellular or biochemical features. Predictive markers need extensive analytical validation – specific for the tool utilized for their assessment – as well as rigorous clinical qualification in the context of the drug treatment for which they define clinical utility.

In this review we focus on the delivery of the clinical data required to advance such drug-diagnostic combination development programmes and ultimately satisfy regulators and payors of the value of contemporaneous changes in diagnostic and treatment practice.Ideally all stakeholders would like to initially estimate, and ultimately specify, the comparative benefit-risk for a new treatment option with and without changing diagnostic practice. Hence, in an ideal world clinical trial design is focused on acquiring biomarker treatment interaction data. In this review we describe the key scientific and feasibility inputs required to design and deliver such trials and the drivers, advantages and disadvantages associated with departing from this model. We do not discuss the discovery of new biomarkers nor the analytical validation and marketing of diagnostic products.Following on from trial design we describe how subsequent success then depends upon the concepts that guide trial design being driven into the complex world of large, multinational clinical trial delivery. For every aspect of a traditional clinical drug trial such as supply, recruitment and adherence, there is a corresponding concept for the diagnostic element. In practice, this means that each patient's contribution to the decision making data-set is subject to double jeopardy (attrition on clinical outcome and biomarker status). Historically, this has led to significantly reduced power for detecting biomarker–treatment interactions, reduced decision making confidence and a waste of valuable human and financial resources. We describe recent practice changes and experience that have led to the successful delivery of such trials focusing on both pre- and on trial aspects. The former includes the pivotal role of tissue banks in accurate estimation of evaluability and prevalence for biomarker assays and the latter several practices designed to engage and incentivize key stakeholders particularly CRAs and pathologists. The result is that in the new world of developing personalized treatments for cancer patients the real-time acquisition and monitoring of biomarker data receives similar support to that traditionally reserved for clinical outcome data and far more patients contribute to the testing of personalized medicine hypotheses.",

In the 13 years since the co-approval of trastuzumab (Herceptin®) from Genentech and the HercepTest® from Dako, the regulatory and commercial environments have yet to adopt a standard methodology for co-development and co-approval. Furthermore, a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to emerge despite attempts by various stakeholders to create an environment of conformity for approval and reimbursement issues.

The combination of molecular diagnostics with targeted biologic therapies has been hailed as a recent innovation with few historical analogs to guide behavior. However, if the definition of companion diagnostics is broadened to include any drug whose FDA approved label requires diagnostic testing before prescription then over 50 drugs across multiple therapeutic areas arise. Most importantly for current drug developers, these drugs represent a wide variety of market situations and with sufficient historical data to evaluate different commercialization strategies for the combination. Included in these examples are drugs which were not initially launched with companion diagnostics but were required to implement companion diagnostics after they were on the market for a period of time. The historical case studies demonstrate that companion diagnostics are neither a universal panacea nor an unmitigated disaster for drug developers but require an understanding of specific situations to determine the utility of companion diagnostics. Numerous case studies highlight how companion diagnostics have been a boon to drug developers including Iressa, statins, Soriatane, Arthrotec, Promacta, Nplate, Letairis, and Tracleer. Other examples provide lessons on how to avoid pitfalls such as Accutane, Ticlid, Tegretol, Ziagen, Actigall and Clozaril.

Given the increasingly unsustainable blockbuster model of drug development, due in part to maturing product pipelines, alongside increasing demands from regulators, healthcare providers and patients for higher standards of safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of new therapies, stratified medicine promises a range of benefits to pharmaceutical and diagnostic firms as well as healthcare providers and patients. However, the transition from ‘blockbusters’ to what might now be termed ‘niche-busters’ will require the adoption of new, innovative business models, the identification of different and perhaps novel types of value along the R&D pathway, and a smarter approach to regulation to facilitate innovation in this area. In this paper we apply the Innogen Centre's interdisciplinary ALSIS methodology, which we have developed for the analysis of life science innovation systems in contexts where the value creation process is lengthy, expensive and highly uncertain, to this emerging field of stratified medicine. In doing so, we consider the complex collaboration, timing, coordination and regulatory interactions that shape business models, value chains and value systems relevant to stratified medicine. More specifically, we explore in some depth two convergence models for co-development of a therapy and diagnostic before market authorisation, highlighting the regulatory requirements and policy initiatives within the broader value system environment that have a key role in determining the probable success and sustainability of these models.",

While the industry is slowly learning from its early missteps, progress is still inhibited by a lack of understanding of the specific hurdles that individual development teams face in developing and commercializing targeted therapies and the requirement for budgets specifically aimed at driving test adoption. This article considers the benefits of optimizing commercial planning in the PM space and the potential negative impact in potentially failing to optimize that planning.

This paper discusses some of these drivers of partnerships and collaborations. Although the number of such partnerships is growing, their rationale and basis for collaboration remains unclear. Public–private collaborations are at the core of the set of new life sciences policies in the UK but there is little indication in the policy documents of clear boundaries for these partnerships. In part, this is due to the lack of empirical evidence at the system level for conceptualising what is still a relatively new approach. The collection of evidence in the form of broad evaluations, rather than tightly focused theoretical studies, is more likely to be related back to systems and be of more use for formulating policy rationales.",

Therefore this is an important issue which needs to be addressed before more resources are wasted on less than informative studies and surveys simply because technologies exist.As a typical example, we have selected and summarise here key studies from the biomedical literature that focus on gene expression profiling of the response to biologic therapies in peripheral blood and biopsy samples in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, spondylarthropathy, inflammatory bowel diseases and psoriasis.We also present the state of the biotechnology market from a European perspective, discuss how spin-offs leverage the power of genomic technologies and describe how they might contribute to personalised medicine.As ethical, legal and social issues are essential in the area of genomics, we analysed these aspects and present here the European situation with a special focus on Hungary.We propose that the synergy of these three issues: pharmacogenomics, biotechnology and regulatory issues should be considered a triad necessary to succeed in personalised medicine.",

However, the numbers have not reached the potential hoped for when the human genome project was completed in 2001. Significant clinical, regulatory, and economic barriers exist and persist. From a regulatory perspective, therapeutics and companion diagnostics are ideally developed simultaneously, with the clinical significance of the diagnostic established using data from the clinical development program of the corresponding therapeutic. Nevertheless, this is not (yet) happening. Most personalized medicines are personalized post hoc, that is, a companion diagnostic is developed separately and approved after the therapeutic. This is due in part to a separate and more complex regulatory process for diagnostics coupled with a lack of clear regulatory guidance. More importantly, payers have placed restrictions on reimbursement of personalized medicines and their companion diagnostics, given the lack of evidence on the clinical utility of many tests. To achieve increased clinical adoption of diagnostics and targeted therapies through more favorable reimbursement and incorporation in clinical practice guidelines, regulators will need to provide unambiguous guidance and manufacturers will need to bring more and better clinical evidence to the market place.",

More specifically, we will often find ourselves left with ‘wicked problems,’ ‘ragged edges,’ and well-disguised ethical precipices. This will be especially true with regard to these extraordinarily expensive cancer drugs that generally yield only extra weeks or extra months of life. Our key ethical question is this: Does every individual faced with cancer have a just claim to receive treatment with one of more of these targeted cancer therapies at social expense? If any of these drugs literally made the difference between an unlimited life expectancy (a cure) and a premature death, that would be a powerful moral consideration in favor of saying that such individuals had a strong just claim to that drug. However, what we are beginning to discover is that different individuals with different genotypes respond more or less positively to these targeted drugs with some in a cohort gaining a couple extra years of life while others gain only extra weeks or months. Should only the strongest responders have a just claim to these drugs at social expense when there is no bright line that separates strong responders from modest responders from marginal responders?

     "abstract": "In affinity proteomics, specific protein-binding molecules (a.k.a. binders), principally antibodies, are applied as reagents in proteome analysis. In recent years, advances in binder technologies have created the potential for an unprecedented view on protein expression and distribution patterns in plasma, cells and tissues and increasingly on protein function. Particular strengths of affinity proteomics methods include detecting proteins in their natural environments of cell or tissue, high sensitivity and selectivity for detection of low abundance proteins and exploiting binding actions such as functional interference in living cells. To maximise the use and impact of affinity reagents, it will be essential to create comprehensive, standardised binder collections. With this in mind, the EU FP7 programme AFFINOMICS (http://www.affinomics.org), together with the preceding EU programmes ProteomeBinders and AffinityProteome, aims to extend affinity proteomics research by generating a large-scale resource of validated protein-binding molecules for characterisation of the human proteome. Activity is directed at producing binders to about 1000 protein targets, primarily in signal transduction and cancer, by establishing a high throughput, coordinated production pipeline. An important aspect of AFFINOMICS is the development of highly efficient recombinant selection methods, based on phage, cell and ribosome display, capable of producing high quality binders at greater throughput and lower cost than hitherto. The programme also involves development of innovative and sensitive technologies for specific detection of target proteins and their interactions, and deployment of binders in proteomics studies of clinical relevance. The need for such binder generation programmes is now recognised internationally, with parallel initiatives in the USA for cancer (NCI) and transcription factors (NIH) and within the Human Proteome Organisation (HUPO).The papers in this volume of New Biotechnology are all contributed by participants at the 5th ESF Workshop on Affinity Proteomics organised by the AFFINOMICS consortium and held in Alpbach, Austria, in March 2011.",

Fyn plays an important role in inflammatory processes and neuronal functions. To generate a synthetic affinity reagent that can be used to probe Fyn, a phage-display library of fibronectin type III monobodies was affinity selected with the Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain of Fyn and three binders were isolated. One of the three binders, G9, is specific in binding to the SH3 domain of Fyn, but not to the other members of the Src family (i.e. Blk, Fgr, Hck, Lck, Lyn, Src and Yes), even though they share 51–81% amino acid identity. The other two bind principally to the Fyn SH3 domain, with some cross-reactivity to the Yes SH3 domain. The G9 binder has a dissociation constant of 166 ± 6 nM, as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry, and binds only to the Fyn SH3 domain out of 150 human SH3 domains examined in an array. Interestingly, although the G9 monobody lacks proline in its randomized BC and FG loops, it binds at the same site on the SH3 domain as proline-rich ligands, as revealed by competition assays. The G9 monobody, identified in this study, may be used as a highly selective probe for detecting and purifying cellular Fyn kinase.",

     "abstract": "The use of library technologies for the generation of affinity proteins often includes an affinity maturation step, based on the construction of secondary libraries from which second generation variants with improved affinities are selected. Here, we describe for the first time the affinity maturation of affibody molecules based on step-wise in vitro molecular evolution, involving cycles of error-prone PCR (epPCR) amplification for the introduction of diversity over the entire 58-residue three-helix bundle structure and ribosome display (RD) for the selection of improved variants. The model affibody molecule for the process was ZRAF322, binding with a 1.9 μm equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) to human Raf-1 (hRaf-1), a protein kinase of central importance in the MAPK/ERK proliferation pathway. The molecular evolution process was followed on both gene and protein levels via DNA sequencing and a biosensor-based binding analysis of pools of selected variants. After two cycles of diversification and selection, a significant increase in binding response of selected pools was seen. DNA sequencing showed that a dominant alanine to valine substitution had been effectively enriched, and was found in 83% of all selected clones, either alone or in combination with other enriched substitutions. The evolution procedure resulted in variants showing up to 26-fold increases in affinity to the hRaf-1 target. Noteworthy, for the two variants showing the highest affinities, substitutions were also found in affibody framework positions, corresponding to regions of the protein domain not addressed by traditional affibody molecule affinity maturation strategies. Interestingly, thermal melting point (Tm) analyses showed that an increased affinity could be associated with both higher and lower Tm values. All investigated variants showed excellent refolding properties and selective binding to hRaf-1, as analysed using a multiplexed bead-based binding assay, making them potentially valuable affinity reagents for cell biology studies.",

Here, we describe a microarray strategy to validate various affinity reagents, such as recombinant single-chain antibodies, mouse monoclonal antibodies and antigen-purified polyclonal antibodies using a highly multiplexed approach. An SH2-specific antigen microarray was designed and generated, containing more than 6000 spots displayed by 14 identical subarrays each with 406 antigens, where 105 of them represented SH2-domain containing proteins. Approximately 400 different affinity reagents of various types were analysed on these antigen microarrays carrying antigens of different types. The microarrays revealed not only very detailed specificity profiles for all the binders, but also showed that overlapping target sequences of spotted antigens were detected by off-target interactions.

With protein profiles from more than 2300 antibodies generated in 384-plex antibody SBAs, three major classes of heat and detergent susceptibility could be described. The results show that washing of the beads with SDS (rather than Tween) after target binding lowered intensity levels of basically all profiles and that about 50% of the profiles appeared to be lowered to a similar extent by heating of the sample. About 33% of the profiles appeared to be insensitive to heat treatment while another 17% showed a positive influence of heat to yield elevated profiles. The results suggest that the classification of antibodies is driven by the molecular properties of the antibody–antigen interaction and can generally not be predicted based on protein class or Western blot data. The experimental scheme presented here can be used to systematically categorize antibodies and thereby combine antibodies with similar properties into targeted arrays for analysis of plasma and serum.",

     "abstract": "Researchers who use protein binders in multiplexed assays can be divided into two camps. One believes that arrays with proteome-wide coverage will become a reality once we have developed binders for all proteins. The sceptics claim that detection with immobilized protein binders and sample labelling will not provide the required specificity. In this article, we review the evidence showing that antibody array analysis of labelled samples can provide meaningful data and discuss the issues raised by the sceptics. We argue that direct the evidence for monospecificity has yet to be published. This will require assays designed to resolve the proteins captured by each binder. One option is to combine array measurement with protein separation. We have developed an assay where labelled sample proteins are separated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) before contact with microsphere-based arrays (Size-MAP; size exclusion chromatography-resolved microsphere-based affinity proteomics). The effect is an ‘antibody array Western blot’ where reactivity of immobilized binders is resolved against the size of the proteins in the sample. We show that Size-MAP is useful to discriminate monospecific- and polyreactive antibodies and for automatic detection of reacting with the same target. The possibility to test specificity directly in array-based measurement should be useful to select the best binders and to determine whether the DNA microarray for the proteome is a realistic goal or not.",

New tools are needed to reveal proteins interacting with specific DNA sequences in situ for further understanding of the orchestration of transcriptional control within the nucleus. We present herein an approach to visualise individual PDIs within cells, based on the in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA). This assay, previously used for the detection of protein–protein interactions in situ, was adapted for analysis of target PDIs, using padlock probes to identify unique DNA sequences in complex genomes. As a proof-of-principle we detected histone H3 interacting with a 26 bp consensus sequence of the Alu-repeat abundantly expressed in the human genome, but absent in mice. However, the mouse genome contains a highly similar sequence, providing a model system to analyse the selectivity of the developed methods. Although efficiency of detection currently is limiting, we conclude that in situ PLA can be used to achieve a highly selective analysis of PDIs in single cells.",

By cyclical fluorescence imaging of at least 100 molecular cell components, fSR-TIS overcomes the spectral limitations of fluorescence microscopy, which is the essential condition for the detection of protein network structures in situ/in vivo. The resulting data sets precisely discriminate between cell types, subcellular structures, cell states and diseases (fSR). With up to 16 bits per protein, the power of combinatorial molecular discrimination (PCMD) is at least 2100 per subcellular data point. It provides the dimensionality necessary to uncover thousands of distinct protein clusters including their subcellular hierarchies controlling protein network topology and function in the one cell or tissue section. Here we review the technology and findings showing that functional protein networks of the cell surface in different cancers encompass the same hierarchical and spatial coding principle, but express cancer-specific toponome codes within that scheme (referred to as TIS codes). Findings suggest that TIS codes, extracted from large-scale toponome data, have the potential to be next-generation biomarkers because of their cell type and disease specificity.

Employing batch fermentation in mineral salts medium, the butanol:acetone ratio was successively increased from 2.3 to 12.4 on a 100-ml scale in serum bottles and from 1.4 to 16.5 on a 1300-ml scale in bioreactors, respectively. The latter cultures were used for DNA microarray analyses to provide new information on the transcriptional changes referring to methyl viologen exposure and thus, exhibit gene expression patterns according to the manipulation of the cellular redox balance. Methyl viologen-exposed cultures revealed lower expression levels of the sol operon (CAP0162-0164) and the adjacent adc gene (CAP0165) responsible for solvent formation as well as iron and sulfate transporters and the CAC0105-encoded ferredoxin. On the contrary, genes for riboflavin biosynthesis, for the butyrate/butanol metabolic pathway and genes coding for sugar transport systems were induced.

This device has for the first time allowed the microlitre scale chromatographic assay of histidine-tagged proteins in a biological sample. To enable this approach, rather than using a high capacity commercial packed bed column which requires large sample volumes and would be susceptible to occlusion by cell debris, a microgram capacity co-polymeric chromatographic substrate suitable for analytical applications was fabricated within a microfluidic channel. This porous co-polymeric IMA micro-chromatographic element, only 27 μl in volume, was assessed for the analytical capture of two different histidine-tagged recombinant fusion proteins. The micro-chromatographic adsorber was fabricated in situ by photo-polymerising an iminodiacetic acid (IDA) functionalised polymer matrix around a template of fused 100 μm diameter NH4Cl particles entirely within the microfluidic channel and then etching away the salt with water to form a network of interconnected voids. The surface of the micro-chromatographic adsorber was chemically functionalised with a chelating agent and loaded with Cu2+ ions. FTIR and NMR analysis verified the presence of the chelating agent on the adsorbent surface and its Cu2+ ion binding capacity was determined to be 2.4 μmol Cu2+ (ml of adsorbent)−1. Micro-scale equilibrium adsorption studies using the two different histidine-tagged proteins, LacI-His6-GFP and α-Synuclein-His8-YFP, were carried out and the protein binding capacity of the adsorbent was determined to be 0.370 and 0.802 mg (g of adsorbent)−1, respectively. The dynamic binding capacity was determined at four different flow rates and found to be comparable to the equilibrium binding capacity at low flow rates. The sensing platform was also used to adsorb LacI-His6-GFP protein from crude cell lysate. During adsorption, laser scanning confocal microscopy identified locations within the adsorbent where protein adsorption and desorption occurred. The findings indicate that minimal channelling, selective product capture and near quantitative elution of the captured (adsorbed) product could be achieved, supporting the application of this new device as a high-throughput process analytical tool (PAT) for the in-process monitoring of histidine-tagged proteins in manufacturing.",

Here, peptidoglycan and cellulose based hydrogels were constructed with potential for diagnosis of wound infection or, for example, Aspergillosis, respectively. These systems respond to extracellular enzymes from microbes or enzymes secreted from the human immune system in case of infection. Laccases as ‘enhanzymes’ were incorporated into these devices for signal and stability enhancement when compared to simple dye release based systems. To retain the enhanzymes within the BRPs, they were either PEGylated laccase (Laccase_PEG) to increase size or methacrylated laccase (Laccase_MA) to allow covalent attachment to the polysaccharide matrices. PEGylation of Trametes hirsuta laccase led to a fivefold increase in size to 270 kDa according to size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Likewise, successful methacrylation of the laccase was demonstrated by using reversed phase chromatography while SEC analysis proved covalent attachment of the enzyme to the methacrylated polysaccharide matrix. Upon incubation of peptidoglycan based BRPs with fluid from infected wounds, the difference to controls was four times higher for Laccase_PEG based signalling when compared to simple dye release. Similarly, the control signals (i.e. leaching) were considerably reduced in case of Laccase_MA incorporated in crosslinked peptidoglycan (PG) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) hydrogels for signalling. In addition, Laccase_MA catalysed colour formation enhanced the signal dramatically with factors between 100- and 600-fold. Laccase_MA was demonstrated to oxidise silica gel immobilised ferulic acid incorporated into the BRP with clearly visible colour changes of 4.5 ΔE units according the CIELab concept upon incubation by trigger enzymes as well as infected wound fluids.",

These compounds are interesting because of their amphiphilicity and antioxidative potential. Synthetic reactions using mono- or disaccharides as one of the substrates may moreover direct new routes for biomass upgrading in the biorefinery. The paper reviews the available data for enzymatic hydroxycinnamate saccharide ester synthesis in organic solvent systems as well as other enzymatic hydroxycinnamate acylations in ionic liquid systems. The choice of solvent system is highly decisive for enzyme stability, selectivity, and reaction yields in these synthesis reactions. To increase the understanding of the reaction environment and to facilitate solvent screening as a crucial part of the reaction design, the review explores the use of activity coefficient models for describing these systems and – more importantly – the use of group contribution model UNIFAC and quantum chemistry based COSMO-RS for thermodynamic predictions and preliminary solvent screening. Surfactant-free microemulsions of a hydrocarbon, a polar alcohol, and water are interesting solvent systems because they accommodate different substrate and product solubilities and maintain enzyme stability. Ionic liquids may provide advantages as solvents in terms of increased substrate and product solubility, higher reactivity and selectivity, as well as tunable physicochemical properties, but their design should be carefully considered in relation to enzyme stability.

The purpose of the pretreatment step is to increase the responsivity of the substrate to enzymatic attack and the type of pretreatment affects the enzymatic conversion efficiency. Destarched corn bran is a fibrous, heteroxylan-rich side-stream from the starch industry which may be used as a feedstock for bioethanol production or as a source of xylose for other purposes. In the present study we demonstrate the use of diffuse reflectance near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) as a rapid and non-destructive analytical tool for evaluation of pretreatment effects on destarched corn bran. NIR was used to achieve classification between 43 differently pretreated corn bran samples using principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchal clustering algorithms. Quantification of the enzymatically released monosaccharides by HPLC was used to design multivariate calibration models (biPLS) on the NIR spectra. The models could predict the enzymatic release of different levels of arabinose, xylose and glucose from all the differently pretreated destarched corn bran samples.

Results demonstrated comparable efficiency of SceA- and Mbg-mediated immobilisation on vegetative cells but a more efficient immobilisation on spores using the SceA anchor, suggesting SceA has greater potential for spore-based applications. The SceA protein was then applied to target BglS onto vegetative cells and spores, and the surface immobilisation was verified by the substantial whole-cell enzymatic activity and enhanced whole-spore enzymatic activity compared to vegetative cells. A dually active B. thuringiensis vegetative cell and spore display system could prove especially valuable for the development of regenerable and heat-stable biocatalysts that function under adverse environmental conditions, for example, an effective feed additive for improved digestion and nutrient absorption by livestock.",

Obtaining high quantities of these enzymes is important for exploring their biosynthetic potential, structural information and catalytic activities. Classical methods for their preparation fail to deliver high yields because of adoption of several/hydroxyapatite chromatography steps. We report here a preparative method for purification of large quantities of two closely related cell bound β-glucosidases (BGL I and BGL II) from Pichia etchellsii that belong to Family 3 glycosylhydrolases. A combination of ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography was used to process milligram quantities of protein with recoveries of up to 53%. A simple affinity based separation resulted in resolution of BGL I and BGL II with high recovery and high specific activities of 74 IU/mg and 32 IU/mg protein respectively. Peptide sequences of BGL II indicated it to be a novel member of Family 3. Methods reported here present a successful strategy for obtaining large quantities of these enzymes.",

     "abstract": "Developmental delay is often a predictor of mental retardation (MR) or autism, two relatively frequent developmental disorders severely affecting intellectual and social functioning. The causes of these conditions remain unknown in most patients. They have a strong genetic component, but the specific genetic defects can only be identified in a fraction of patients. Recent developments in genomics supported the establishment of the causal link between copy number variants in the genomes of some patients and their affection. One of the techniques suitable for this analysis is array comparative genome hybridization, which can be used both for detailed mapping of chromosome rearrangements identified by classical cytogenetics and for the identification of novel submicroscopic gains or losses of genetic material. We illustrate the power of this approach in two patients. Patient 1 had a cytogenetically visible deletion of chromosome X and the molecular analysis was used to specify the gene content of the deletion and the prognosis of the child. Patient 2 had a seemingly normal karyotype and the analysis revealed a small recurrent deletion of chromosome 1 likely to be responsible for his phenotype. However, the genetic dissection of MR and autism is complicated by high heterogeneity of the genetic aberrations among patients and by broad variability of phenotypic effects of individual genetic defects.",

A combination of grinding, microwave treatment and sonication proved to give the best lipid extract yield. Freeze-dried algal biomass was also utilised for thermal degradation studies. The degradation exhibited three distinct regions – primary cell structure breakage paralleled by evaporation of water, followed by two predominant exothermic degradation processes. The latter were modelled using nth order apparent kinetics. The activation energies of the degradation processes were determined to be 120–126 kJ/mol and 122–132 kJ/mol, respectively.

     "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), such as the linear amphipathic cathelicidins, are produced widely in the natural world and are active against a broad range of pathogenic microorganisms. Their potential as a new range of antibiotics has prompted numerous studies of AMP structure and function. Most such studies are performed with chemically synthesised peptides, but a simple and rapid biosynthetic route would offer a more cost-effective alternative for the production of AMPs and analysis of their structure/function relationships. The cysteine protease domain (CPD) from Vibrio cholerae MARTX toxin possesses an autocleaving ability that is inducible by inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6). When coupled with a hexa-histidine tag and fused to the C-terminus of an AMP, this AMP–CPD fusion may be expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. A brief on-column induction of cleavage liberates the AMP, and subsequent polishing using hydrophobic interaction resin allows for purification of the peptide within a day. We used this system to express and purify several 18-residue cathelicidin variants and tested their activity on E. coli, Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans. This approach to linear AMP production may aid rapid construction and purification of structural variants for subsequent functional analysis.",

One novel, putative cellulosomal protein (referred to as endoglucanase Z) contains a catalytic module from the glycosyl hydrolase family (GH9) and demonstrated higher levels of expression than other cellulosomal cellulases in Avicel-containing cultures. Purified EngZ had optimal activity at pH 7.0, 40°C, and the major hydrolysis product from the cellooligosaccharides was cellobiose. EngZ's specific activity toward crystalline cellulose (Avicel and acid-swollen cellulose) was 10–20-fold higher than other cellulosomal cellulase activities. A large percentage of the reducing ends that were produced by this enzyme from acid-swollen cellulose were released as soluble sugar. EngZ has the capability of reducing the viscosity of Avicel at an intermediate-level between exo- and endo-typing cellulases, suggesting that it is a processive endoglucanase. In conclusion, EngZ was highly expressed in cellulolytic systems and demonstrated processive endoglucanase activity, suggesting that it plays a major role in the hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose and acts as a cellulosomal enzyme in C. cellulovorans.",

To further improve the lipid production, response surface methodology (RSM) was used and a 3-level 4-factor Box–Behnken design was adopted to evaluate the effects of C/N ratio, inoculum concentration, initial pH and fermentation time on the cell growth and lipid accumulation of T. fermentans. Under the optimum conditions (C/N ratio 165, inoculum concentration 11%, initial pH 7.6 and fermentation time 9 days), a lipid concentration of 15.8 g/L, which is quite close to the predicted value of 15.6 g/L, could be achieved after cultivation of T. fermentans at 25 °C on the pretreated bagasse hydrolysate and the corresponding lipid coefficient (lipid yield per mass of sugar, %) was 14.2. These represent a 32.8% improvement in the lipid concentration and a 21.4% increase in the lipid coefficient compared with the original values before optimization (11.9 g/L and 11.7).

The resultant hybrid TJ14 displayed ability to rapidly utilize glucose, and produced ethanol (46.6 g/l) from 10% glucose fermentation medium at high temperature (41°C). Not only ethanol productivity at 41°C but also acid tolerance (Acd+) was improved in TJ14 as compared with its parental strains, enabling TJ14 to grow in liquid medium even at pH 3. TJ14 maintained high ethanol productivity (46.0 g/l) from 10% glucose when fermentation was done under multiple-stress conditions (41°C and pH 3.5). Furthermore, when TJ14 was subjected to a repeated-batch fermentation scheme, the growth and ethanol production of TJ14 were maintained at excellent levels over ten cycles of fermentation. Thus, the multiple-stress (Htg+ Hep+ Acd+) resistant strain TJ14 should be useful for cost-effective bioethanol production under high-temperature and acidic conditions.",

Overall, cell cultures in probe-independent OSRs of different nominal volumes ranging from 250 mL to 200 L achieved similar cell densities, recombinant protein concentrations, and pH and DO profiles when having the same kLa.

The disposable Wave bioreactor is one of the most promising technologies, providing ease of operation and no cross-contamination, and using an innovative undulation movement that ensures good mixing and oxygen transfer without cell damage. However, its recentness demands further characterization. This study evaluated the residence time distribution (RTD) in Wave, allowing the characterization of mixing and flow and the comparison with ideal models and a Stirred tank reactor (STR) used for mammalian cell culture. RTD was determined using methylene blue with pulse input methodology, at three flow rates common in mammalian cell culture (3.3 × 10−5 m3/h, 7.9 × 10−5 m3/h, and 1.25 × 10−4 m3/h) and one typical of microbial culture (5 × 10−3 m3/h). Samples were taken periodically and the absorbance read at 660 nm. It was observed that Wave behavior diverted from ideal models, but was similar to STR. Therefore, the deviations are not related to the particular Wave rocking mechanism, but could be associated with the inadequacy of these reactors to operate in continuous mode or to a possible inability of the theoretical models to properly describe the behavior of reactors designed for mammalian cell culture.

     "abstract": "For the past 30 years, pressure inactivation of microorganisms has been developed in biosciences, in particular for foods and more recently for biological products, including pharmaceutical ones. In many past studies, the effect of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) processes on pathogens focused mainly on the effect of an increase of the pressure value. To assure the safety of pharmaceutical products containing fragile therapeutic components, development of new decontamination processes at the lowest pressure value is needed to maintain their therapeutic properties. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the impact of the process parameters characterizing high-pressure treatments [such as the pressurization rate (PR) and the application mode (AM)] on the inactivation of pathogens, in particular to determine how these parameters values could help decrease the pressure value necessary to reach the same inactivation level. The effect of these physical parameters was evaluated on the inactivation of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 which is an opportunistic pathogen of important relevance in the medical, pharmaceutical and food domains. Human blood plasma was chosen as the suspension medium because of its physiological importance in the transfusion field. It was shown that the optimization of all the selected parameters could lead to a high inactivation level (≈5 log10 decrease of the initial bacterial load) at a pressure level as low as 200 MPa, underlining some synergistic effects among these parameters. Complete inactivation of the initial bacterial population was achieved for the following conditions: PR = 50 MPa s−1, AM = 5 × 2 min, T ≈ −5°C and P = 300 MPa.",

Both the sludges were diluted with their sedimentation supernatant to avoid modifying their metabolism. The results show that the type of sludge has a major impact on the performance of the system. Seeding an MFC with anaerobic acclimated sludge leads to a more rapid start-up of electricity production and the absence of a lag period. In the MFC seeded with anaerobic sludge, the steady-state operation conditions were achieved in less than 10 days, while in the aerobic sludge-seeded MFC more than 20 days were necessary to achieve this regime. The anaerobic sludge also led to better performance of the MFC. Thus, maximum power densities above 300 mW m−2 were obtained for such systems (i.e. two times higher than that achieved with the aerobic sludge-seeded MFC in the same setup). This better performance is a direct consequence of the greater availability of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) in anaerobic sludge. However, the performance is not a consequence of the coulombic efficiency in the use of the COD to produce electricity because the aerobic sludge-seeded MFC doubles this figure with respect to the anaerobic sludge-seeded system.",

In the present investigation the antimicrobial activity of Gracilariopsis longissima lipidic extract was assayed and its chemical characterization was carried out by means of advanced analytical techniques such as gas-chromatography and multinuclear and multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. G. longissima lipidic extract showed an antibacterial activity against several Vibrio species. These results are interesting considering both the resistance against antibiotics developed by vibrios and the need to control fish and shellfish diseases due to vibriosis. Analysis of fatty acid methyl esters performed by gas-chromatography showed that palmitic acid methyl ester (16:0) was the predominant saturated fatty acid (42%), while, among monounsaturated fatty acids, oleic acid methyl ester (18:1) prevailed (8.5%). Because the palmitic acid represents the main component of fatty acids we hypothesized its involvement in the antibacterial activity observed. However, a pure sample of palmitic acid did not show an antibacterial activity. The fatty acid profile of G. longissima revealed also an interesting composition in polyunsaturated fatty acids and in particular the ratio of ω-3 to ω-6 fatty acids was >1 thus suggesting that this macroalga may be used as a natural source of ω3. Moreover, the 1H NMR spectrum in CDCl3 of algal lipid fraction shows the characteristic signals of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids as well as other metabolites. Interestingly, in the lipid extract the presence of polyhydroxybutyrate, a linear biodegradable and biocompatible polyester, was clearly identified by NMR spectroscopy. In conclusion, the lipidic extract of G. longissima on account of its antimicrobial activity, nutritional value and content in biodegradable and biocompatible polyester represents an interesting potential biotechnological resource.",

     "abstract": "This study investigated the fungi diversity of fresh olive (Olea europaea L.) fruits, olive paste (crushed olives) and olive pomace (solid waste) and screened and quantified enzymatic activities with biotechnological applications. Fungi were randomly isolated from olive cultivars from Castilla La Mancha region (Spain). Identification included comparison of their polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons of the ITS1–5.8S–ITS2 ribosomal DNA region, followed by nucleotide sequence analysis. Fourteen different species with DNA sequences of different similarities were identified, belonging to seven different genera (Aspergillus, Penicillium, Rhizomucor, Mucor, Rhizopus, Lichtheimia and Galactomyces). Aspergillus fumigatus, followed by Galactomyces geotrichum, Penicillium commune and Rhizomucor variabilis var. regularior were the most frequent species. Specific enzyme screening was assayed on agar plates, using cellobiose, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), polygalacturonic acid and CaCl2/Tween 80 as substrates for β-glucosidase, carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase), polygalacturonase and lipase, respectively. Species exhibiting the best activities were: Aspergillus fumigatus (for β-glucosidase, CMCase and lipase); Rhizopus oryzae (for β-glucosidase and lipase); Rhizomucor variabilis (for β-glucosidase, CMCase and polygalacturonase); Mucor fragilis (β-glucosidase, CMCase and lipase); Galactomyces geotrichum (for β-glucosidase, polygalacturonase and lipase) and Penicillium commune and Penicillium crustosum (for lipase). The species that had shown the best enzymatic activities were grown on hemicellulose, cellulose and pectin and some activities were quantified (xylanase, cellulase, β-glucosidase and pectinase). An isolate of A. fumigatus and one of A. niger showed the best cellulase and xylanase activities, while no species presented good pectinase and β-glucosidase activities. The selected species with potential enzymatic activities could be used for future applications of industrial interest.",

     "abstract": "Use of thermotolerant strains is a promising way to reduce the cost of maintaining optimum temperatures in the fermentation process. Here we investigated genetically a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain showing a high-temperature (41 °C) growth (Htg+) phenotype and the result suggested that the Htg+ phenotype of this Htg+ strain is dominant and under the control of most probably six genes, designated HTG1 to HTG6. As compared with a Htg− strain, the Htg+ strain showed a higher survival rate after exposure to heat shock at 48 °C. Moreover, the Htg+ strain exhibited a significantly high content of trehalose when cultured at high temperature and stronger resistance to Congo Red, an agent that interferes with cell wall construction. These results suggest that a strengthened cell wall in combination with increased trehalose accumulation can support growth at high temperature. The gene CDC19, encoding pyruvate kinase, was cloned as the HTG2 gene. The CDC19 allele from the Htg+ strain possessed five base changes in its upstream region, and two base changes resulting in silent mutations in its coding region. Interestingly, the latter base changes are probably responsible for the increased pyruvate kinase activity of the Htg+ strain. The possible mechanism leading to this increased activity and to the Htg+ phenotype, which may lead to the activation of energy metabolism to maintain cellular homeostasis, is discussed.",

The enzymatic oxidation of glycolaldehyde into glyoxal was first reported in alcohol oxidases (AODs) from methylotrophic yeasts such as Candida and Pichia, and glycerol oxidase (GLOD) from Aspergillus japonicus, although it had been reported that these enzymes are specific to short-chain linear aliphatic alcohols and glycerol, respectively. These enzymes continuously oxidized ethylene glycol into glyoxal via glycolaldehyde. The AODs produced by Aspergillus ochraceus and Penicillium purpurescens also oxidized glycolaldehyde. A new enzyme exhibiting oxidase activity for glycolaldehyde was reported from a newly isolated bacterium, Paenibacillus sp. AIU 311. The Paenibacillus enzyme exhibited high activity for aldehyde alcohols such as glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde, but not for methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol or glycerol. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Paenibacillus AOD was similar to that of superoxide dismutases (SODs), but not to that of methylotrophic yeast AODs. Then, it was demonstrated that SODs had oxidase activity for aldehyde alcohols including glycolaldehyde.

     "abstract": "Tyrosinases are copper-containing dioxygen activating enzymes found in many species of bacteria and are usually associated with melanin production. These proteins have a strong preference for phenolic and diphenolic substrates and are somewhat limited in their reaction scope, always producing an activated quinone as product. Despite this fact they have potential in several biotechnological applications, including the production of novel mixed melanins, protein cross-linking, phenolic biosensors, production of l-DOPA, phenol and dye removal and biocatalysis. Although most studies have used Streptomyces sp. enzymes, there are several other examples of these proteins that are also of potential interest. For instance a solvent tolerant enzyme has been described, as well as an enzyme with both tyrosinase and laccase activities, enzymes with altered substrate preferences, an enzyme produced as an inactive zymogen as well as examples which do not require auxiliary proteins for copper insertion (unlike the Streptomyces sp. enzymes which do require such a protein). This article will summarise the reports on the biotechnological applications of bacterial tyrosinases as well as the current information available on the different types of this enzyme.",

     "abstract": "Cells of Candida guilliermondii (ATCC 201935) were permeabilised with surfactant treatment (CTAB or Triton X-100) or a freezing–thawing procedure. Treatments were monitored by in situ activities of the key enzymes involved in xylose metabolism, that is, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), xylose reductase (XR) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XD). The permeabilising ability of the surfactants was dependent on its concentration and incubation time. The optimum operation conditions for the permeabilisation of C. guilliermondii with surfactants were 0.41 mM (CTAB) or 2.78 mM (Triton X-100), 30 °C, and pH 7 at 200 rpm for 50 min. The maximum permeabilisation measured in terms of the in situ G6PD activity observed was, in order, as follows: CTAB (122.4 ± 15.7 U/gcells) > freezing–thawing (54.3 ± 1.9 U/gcells) > Triton X-100 (23.5 ± 0.0 U/gcells). These results suggest that CTAB surfactant is more effective in the permeabilisation of C. guilliermondii cells in comparison to the freezing–thawing and Triton X-100 treatments. Nevertheless, freezing–thawing was the only treatment that allowed measurable in situ XR activity. Therefore, freezing–thawing permeabilised yeast cells could be used as a source of xylose reductase for analytical purposes or for use in biotransformation process such as xylitol preparation from xylose. The level of in situ xylose reductase was found to be 13.2 ± 0.1 U/gcells.",

With every 100 gallons of biodiesel produced, 5–10 gallons of the crude glycerol is left behind containing several impurities which makes its disposal difficult. The objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the impact of biodiesel-derived crude glycerol upon microbial growth and production of 1,3-propanediol by Citrobacter freundii. Five different grades of crude glycerol (obtained from biodiesel preparation using jatropha, soybean, sunflower, rice bran and linseed oils) were used. Crude glycerol caused significant inhibition of microbial growth and subsequently 1,3-propanediol production as compared to pure glycerol. Therefore, a process was developed for the treatment of crude glycerol using solvents before fermentation wherein four different non-polar solvents were examined yielding different grades of pretreated glycerol. Subsequently, the potential toxic effects of pretreated glycerol on the growth and 1,3-propanediol production by C. freundii was evaluated. In case of petroleum ether-treated crude glycerol obtained from jatropha & linseed and hexane-treated crude glycerol obtained from rice bran, the yields obtained were comparable to the pure glycerol. Similarly, soybean-derived glycerol gave comparable results after treatment with either hexane or petroleum ether.",

     "abstract": "Affinity tags have become highly popular tools for purifying recombinant proteins from crude extracts by affinity chromatography. Besides, short peptides are excellent ligands for affinity chromatography, as they are not likely to cause an immune response in case of leakage into the product, they are more stable than antibodies to elution and cleaning conditions and they usually have very acceptable selectivity. Hydropathically complementary peptides designed de novo show enough selectivity to be used successfully as peptide ligands for protein purification from crude extracts. Recognition specificity and selectivity in the interaction between the complementary peptide pair His-Leu-Leu-Phe-Pro-Ile-Ile-Ile-Ala-Ala-Ser-Leu and Lys-Asn-Tyr-Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Met-Glu-Lys-Arg-Phe have been demonstrated by other authors.In this work, we designed a recombinant protein purification method using a peptide affinity tag that binds to a peptide-binding partner immobilized on a chromatographic matrix. The enhanced green fluorescent protein expressed (EGFP) in Escherichia coli was used as the model.The peptide Gly-Gly-Gly-His-Leu-Leu-Phe-Pro-Ile-Ile-Ile-Ala-Ala-Ser-Leu was synthesized by solid phase using the Fmoc chemistry and immobilized in NHS-Sepharose (PC-Sepharose). Gly residues were added as a spacer arm at the N terminus. The EGFP was expressed either with the fusion tag Lys-Asn-Tyr-Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Met-Glu-Lys-Arg-Phe on the C terminus (EGFP-CPTag) or without any fusion tag.After cell disruption, the extract was directly applied to the PC-Sepharose column equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The adsorbed EGFP-CPTag was then eluted with 1 M Tris. The yield was 98% and the purification factor 4.6. By contrast, EGFP without tag pass through without interacting with the PC-Sepharose column.The method designed can be applied for the purification of other recombinant proteins.",

     "abstract": "3-Hydroxypropionaldehyde (3HPA) is a promising versatile substance derived from the renewable feedstock glycerol. It is a product of glycerol metabolism in Lactobacillus reuteri. Because of toxic effects, the biotechnological production is poor. In this work the biocatalyst lifetime and product formation could be drastically increased. In the established two-step process already applied, cells are grown in the first step under anaerobic conditions, and in the second step the immobilised or suspended biocatalyst is used for 3HPA-production under strict anaerobic conditions. In the first step it was possible to reach a biomass concentration of 5.5 g CDW/L (OD600 ≈ 23.4). In the second step, normally, 3HPA accumulates to a toxic concentration and the reaction stops in less than 60 min because of the interaction of 3HPA with cell components. To prevent this, the toxic product is bound to the newly found scavenger carbohydrazide to form the hydrazone. For the first time it was possible to recycle the immobilised biocatalyst for at least ten cycles (overall life time > 33 hours) in a repeated batch biotransformation with an overall production of 67 g 3HPA. The optimal pH-value was between 6.8 and 7.2 at an optimal temperature of 40–45°C. In a single batch biotransformation with suspended resting cells it was possible to produce 150 g/L 3HPA as carbohydrazone at an overall productivity of 10.7 g L−1 hours−1. In a single fed-batch biotransformation at 45°C 138 g/L glycerol was converted into 108 g/L 3HPA with an overall productivity of 21.6 g L−1 hours−1. This is the highest 3HPA concentration and productivities reported so far for the microbial production of 3HPA from glycerol.",

     "abstract": "A mathematical model is presented for the kinetically controlled synthesis of cephalexin that describes the heterogeneous reaction–diffusion process involved in a batch reactor with glyoxyl-agarose immobilized penicillin acylase. The model is based on equations considering reaction and diffusion components. Reaction kinetics was considered according to the mechanism proposed by Schroën, while diffusion of the reacting species was described according to Fick's law. Intrinsic kinetic and diffusion parameters were experimentally determined in independent experiments. It was found that from the four kinetic constants, the one corresponding to the acyl-enzyme complex hydrolysis step had the greatest value, as previously reported by other authors. The effective diffusion coefficients of all substances were about 5 × 10−10 m2/s, being 10% lower than free diffusion coefficients and therefore agreed with the highly porous structure of glyoxyl-agarose particles. Simulations made from the reaction–diffusion model equations were used to evaluate and analyze the impact of internal diffusional restrictions in function of catalyst enzyme loading and particle size. Increasing internal diffusional restrictions decreases the Cex synthesis/hydrolysis ratio, the conversion yield and the specific productivity. A nonlinear relationship between catalyst enzyme loading and specific productivity of Cex was obtained with the implication that an increase in catalyst enzyme loading will not increase the volumetric productivity by the same magnitude as it occurs with the free enzyme. Optimization of catalyst and reactor design should be done considering catalyst enzyme loading and particle size as the most important variables. The approach presented can be extended to other processes catalyzed by immobilized enzymes.",

Such trend can be ascribed a particular set of characteristics of microchannel reactors, namely the enhanced mass and heat transfer, combined with easier handling and smaller volumes required, as compared to traditional reactors.In the present work, a continuous production process of 4-cholesten-3-one by the enzymatic oxidation of cholesterol without the formation of any by-product was assessed. The production was carried out within Y-shaped microchannel reactors in an aqueous–organic two-phase system. Substrate was delivered from the organic phase to aqueous phase containing cholesterol oxidase and the product formed partitions back to the organic phase. The aqueous phase was then forced through a plug-flow reactor, containing immobilized catalase. This step aimed at the reduction of hydrogen peroxide formed as a by-product during cholesterol oxidation, to avoid cholesterol oxidase deactivation due to said by-product. This setup was compared with traditional reactors and modes of operation. The results showed that microchannel reactor geometry outperformed traditional stirred tank and plug-flow reactors reaching similar conversion yields at reduced residence time. Coupling the plug-flow reactor containing catalase enabled aqueous phase reuse with maintenance of 30% catalytic activity of cholesterol oxidase while eliminating hydrogen peroxide. A final production of 36 m of cholestenone was reached after 300 hours of operation.",

This current study aims to evaluate the scalability of the controlled glucose release technique to pilot scale bioreactors.Throughout all scales, that is, deep well plates, 3 L bioreactor and 150 L bioreactor cultivations, the growth was very similar and the model protein, a recombinant alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was produced with a high yield in soluble form.Moreover, EnBase Flo also was successfully used as a controlled starter culture in high cell density fed-batch cultivations with external glucose feeding. Here the external feeding pump was started after overnight cultivation with EnBase Flo. Final optical densities in these cultivations reached 120 (corresponding to about 40 g L−1 dry cell weight) and a high expression level of ADH was obtained. The EnBase cultivation technology ensures a controlled initial cultivation under fed-batch mode without the need for a feeding pump.

     "abstract": "Previous research has suggested that enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) from wastewater can be achieved under continuous aerobic conditions over the short term. However, little is known how environmental conditions might affect aerobic EBPR performance. Consequently we have investigated the impact of temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations on EBPR performance under strictly aerobic conditions. A sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was operated for 108 days on a six-hour cycle (four cycles a day). The SBR ran under alternating anaerobic–aerobic conditions as standard and then operated under strictly aerobic conditions for one cycle every three or four days. SBR operational temperature (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30°C), pH (6, 7, 8 and 9) and DO concentration (0.5, 2.0 and 3.5 mg/L) were changed consecutively during the aerobic cycle. Recorded increases in mixed liquor phosphorus (P) concentrations during aerobic carbon source uptake (P release) were affected by the biomass P content rather than the imposed changes in the operational conditions. Thus, P release levels increased with biomass P content. By contrast, subsequent aerobic P assimilation (P uptake) levels were both affected by changes in operational temperature and pH, and peaked at 20–25°C and pH 7–8. Highest P uptake detected under these SBR operating conditions was 15.4 mg P g-MLSS−1 (at 25°C, pH 7 and DO 2.0 mg/L). The ability of the community for linked aerobic P release and P uptake required the presence of acetate in the medium, a finding which differs from previous data, where these are reported to occur in the absence of any exogenous carbon source. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on samples collected from the SBR, and Candidatus ‘Accumulibacter phosphatis’ cells were detected with PAOmix probes through the operational periods. Thus, Candidatus ‘Accumulibacter phosphatis’ seemed to perform P removal in the SBR as shown in previous studies on P removal under strictly aerobic conditions.",

     "abstract": "Textile wastewater is difficult to treat as it usually contains considerable amounts of different pollutants, which are often recalcitrant, toxic and inhibitory. Therefore, complex treatment schemes based on the sequence of various steps are usually required for an effective treatment.

The adoption of new technologies for on-site treatment, instead, would be optimal, deeply reducing treatment costs. An innovative technology exhibiting several characteristics appropriate for the attainment of such a goal is sequencing batch biofilter granular reactor (SBBGR). To assess the suitability of this technology, two lab-scale reactors were operated, treating mixed municipal-textile wastewater and a pure textile effluent, respectively. Results have demonstrated that mixed wastewater can be successfully treated with very low hydraulic retention times (less than 10 hours). Furthermore, SBBGR shows to be an effective pre-treatment for textile wastewater for discharge into sewer systems. The economic evaluation of the process showed operative costs of 0.10 and 0.19 € per m3 of mixed wastewater and textile wastewater, respectively.",

The fungus efficiently decolourised (colour removal up to 96%) four simulated wastewaters that mimic the recalcitrance of real ones for pH values, concentration of dyes, additives and salts. In the culture condition with the lowest N content, the decolourisation was coupled with an important detoxification of two simulated effluents, underlining the important influence of the cultural medium composition not only on the degradation but also on the detoxification of industrial wastes. In the other cases, despite an extensive decolourisation, no detoxification was observed. The fungus was further tested against a real effluent, collected from a wastewater treatment plant before and after the tertiary treatment (ozonation) to compare the two technologies in terms of chemical and toxicological parameters. The fungal treatment, although less efficient than ozonation, caused a good decolourisation of the effluent, with colour values within the threshold limits of the Italian law; both the fungal and the ozone treatment caused a detoxification, but only towards one of the three organisms used for the ecotoxicological tests. These results underline the crucial importance of the ecotoxicological analysis in assessing the applicability of a wastewater treatment.",

In this study, the performance of a steady-state biofilter inoculated with the fungus Sporothrix variecibatus was tested at different empty bed residence times (EBRTs), and at different inlet concentrations of ATS, corresponding to total pollutant loading rates ranging from 30 to 490 g m−3 hour−1. Styrene was somewhat better removed (47–100%) in the biofilter than acetone (34–100%) and toluene (42–100%), with maximum elimination capacities (ECmax) of 108, 72 and 144 g m−3 hour−1, for ATS, respectively. Besides, it was observed that, although increasing the concentration of ATS decreased their removal, the presence of toluene also decreased the ECmax of both acetone and toluene in the ternary mixture. During transient operations, the biofilter was subjected to intermittent shutdown and re-start operations where the gas-phase pollutant flow was stopped for either 5 or 16 d.

Batch biodegradation tests were conducted, using Sporothrix-like microorganisms present in the leachate of the biofilter, with a mixture of ATS as the sole carbon source. Complete removal of ATS was observed within the test period of 168 hours. Styrene was degraded faster, with a specific substrate utilization rate of 0.9 mg styrene mg biomass−1 hour−1, followed by toluene (0.6) and acetone (0.44). The effectiveness of the biofilter to reach high total EC (321.3 g m−3 hour−1), and withstand transient operations shows the robustness of this fungal-bioreactor and its suitability to handle emissions from a fibreglass and composite manufacturing industry.",

     "abstract": "This paper outlines the procedure for developing artificial neural network (ANN) based models for three bioreactor configurations used for waste-gas treatment. The three bioreactor configurations chosen for this modelling work were: biofilter (BF), continuous stirred tank bioreactor (CSTB) and monolith bioreactor (MB). Using styrene as the model pollutant, this paper also serves as a general database of information pertaining to the bioreactor operation and important factors affecting gas-phase styrene removal in these biological systems. Biological waste-gas treatment systems are considered to be both advantageous and economically effective in treating a stream of polluted air containing low to moderate concentrations of the target contaminant, over a rather wide range of gas-flow rates. The bioreactors were inoculated with the fungus Sporothrix variecibatus, and their performances were evaluated at different empty bed residence times (EBRT), and at different inlet styrene concentrations (Ci). The experimental data from these bioreactors were modelled to predict the bioreactors performance in terms of their removal efficiency (RE, %), by adequate training and testing of a three-layered back propagation neural network (input layer–hidden layer–output layer). Two models (BIOF1 and BIOF2) were developed for the BF with different combinations of easily measurable BF parameters as the inputs, that is concentration (g m−3), unit flow (h−1) and pressure drop (cm of H2O). The model developed for the CSTB used two inputs (concentration and unit flow), while the model for the MB had three inputs (concentration, G/L (gas/liquid) ratio, and pressure drop). Sensitivity analysis in the form of absolute average sensitivity (AAS) was performed for all the developed ANN models to ascertain the importance of the different input parameters, and to assess their direct effect on the bioreactors performance. The performance of the models was estimated by the regression coefficient values (R2) for the test data set. The results obtained from this modelling work can be useful for obtaining important relationships between different bioreactor parameters and for estimating their safe operating regimes.",

The same bacterial strain was cultivated anaerobically with Na-citrate and Pd2(NO)3 was added during the exponential growth to afford a Pd-EPS, named Bio-Pd (A), that, after isolation and purification, was used as catalyst in the reductive dehalogenation of chlorobenzene as model reaction. For comparison other two palladium binding polysaccharides were prepared: (a) a second type Pd-EPS, named Bio-Pd (B), was obtained by an exchange reaction with Pd acetate starting from an iron-free EPS produced by strain BAS-10 growing on Na-citrate medium; (b) a third type of palladium, named Bio-Pd (C), bound to a different polysaccharide, was recovered after the same exchange reaction applied on glycolipid emulsan obtained from an aerobic culture of Acinetobacter venetianus RAG 1. The superiority of Bio-Pd (A), as catalyst, vs Bio-Pd (B) and (C) was demonstrated. This approach to use microorganisms to prepare metal bound polysaccharides is novel and permits to prepare metal species, sequestrated in aqueous phase that can be useful either as catalysts for synthetic applications or to support the microbial biotransformation of pollutants.",

     "abstract": "The anaerobic degradation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (246TCP) has been studied in batch experiments. Granular sludges previously acclimated to 2,4-dichlorophenol (24DCP) and then adapted to at a load of 330 μM 246TCP d−1 in two expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactors were used. One of the reactors had been bioaugmented with Desulfitobacterium strains whereas the other served as control. 246TCP was tested at concentrations between 250 and 760 μM. The study focused on the fate of both fermentation products and chlorophenols derived from dechlorination of 246TCP. This compound mainly affected the biodegradation of acetate and propionate, which were inhibited at 246TCP concentrations above 380 μM. Lactate and ethanol were also accumulated at 760 μM 246TCP. Methanogenesis was strongly inhibited at 246TCP concentrations higher than 380 μM. A diauxic production of methane was observed, which can be described by a kinetic model in which acetoclastic methanogenesis was inhibited, whereas hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was hardly affected by 246TCP. The similarity of the kinetic parameters obtained for the control and the bioaugmented sludges (Ki = 175–200 μM 246TCP and n = 7) suggests that methanogenesis is not affected by the bioaugmentation. Moreover, the 246TCP dechlorination occurred mainly at ortho position, successively generating 24DCP and 4-chlorophenol (4CP), which was identified as final product. The bioaugmentation does not significantly improve the anaerobic biodegradation of 246TCP. It has been shown that the active biomass is capable of bioaccumulating 246TCP and products from dechlorination, which are subsequently excreted to the bulk medium when the biomass becomes active again. A kinetic model is proposed which simultaneously explains 246TCP and 24DCP reductive dechlorinations and includes the 246TCP bioaccumulation. The values of the kinetic parameters for 246TCP dechlorination were not affected by bioaugmentation (Vmax = 5.3 and 5.1 μM h−1 and Ks = 5.8 and 13.1 μM for control and bioaugmented sludges, respectively).",

     "abstract": "Enterobacter sp. LY402 is a bacterium isolated from polluted soil. It can efficiently degrade polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) under aerobic conditions. However, the degradation was limited when it comes to high chlorine or double para-substituted PCBs. Biphenyl dioxygenase (BDO) is the key enzyme in the PCBs biodegradation process. It has been confirmed that the α-subunit of the iron–sulfur protein of biphenyl 2,3-dioxygenase (BphA1) directly influenced catalytic activities and substrate specificity. To know the degradation characteristics of BDO to PCBs, we analyzed PCBs degradation abilities of BphA1 from Enterobacter sp. LY402 by experiment and molecular simulation. Firstly, the degradation experiment of PCBs was performed, and the degradation rate constants (k) were calculated. Then the three-dimensional model of LY402-BphA1 was constructed. Through further docking studies with 209 PCB congeners, the PCBs binding abilities of LY402-BphA1 were measured and some crucial active site residues were identified. Moreover, the molecular descriptors of PCBs were calculated and analyzed to determine the correlation of molecular properties and degradation. The results showed that the affinity energy of PCBs was well matched with the k values of the different number of chlorine substituents. The binding ability of BphA1 greatly affected the PCBs degradation abilities of BDO. Hydrophobic contact was the main interaction between the residues of active site and PCB substrates. The number and subposition of chlorine substituents would influence the PCBs binding ability of BphA1 significantly. Ser283, Val287, Gly321 and Tyr384 residues in the active site of LY402-BphA1 showed high variability, and the space limitation of the active site of BphA1 had negative influence on the PCBs binding affinity of BDO. The changes of physical, electronic and geometrical properties could influence degradation and binding affinity of PCBs. Analysis of structural information, binding affinity and influences of molecular properties could be used to direct further modification of BDO to enhance biodegradation of PCBs and other toxic compounds.",

     "abstract": "There is very limited information on the biotransformation of organochlorine pesticide chlordane by microorganisms, and no systematic study on the metabolic products and pathways for chlordane transformation by wood-rot fungi has been conducted. In this study, trans-chlordane was metabolized with the wood-rot fungi species Phlebia lindtneri, Phlebia brevispora and Phlebia aurea, which are capable of degrading polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and heptachlor epoxide. At the end of 42 days of incubation, over 50% of trans-chlordane was degraded by the fungal treatments in pure cultures. These fungi transformed trans-chlordane to at least eleven metabolites including a large amount of hydroxylated products such as 3-hydroxychlordane, chlordene chlorohydrin, heptachlor diol, monohydroxychlordene and dihydroxychlordene. P. lindtneri particularly can metabolize oxychlordane, a recalcitrant epoxide product of chlordane, into a hydroxylated product through substitution of chlorine atom by hydroxyl group. The present results suggest that hydroxylation reactions play an important role in the metabolism of trans-chlordane by these Phlebia species. Additionally, transformation of trans-chlordane and production of hydroxylated metabolites were efficiently inhibited by the addition of cytochrome P450 inhibitors, piperonyl butoxide and 1-aminobenzotriazole, demonstrating that fungal cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in some steps of trans-chlordane metabolism, particularly in the hydroxylation process.",

     "abstract": "In situ anaerobic bioremediation of chlorinated solvents such as perchloroethene (PCE) frequently faces the problem of accumulating toxic, lower chlorinated compounds such as dichloroethene (cis-DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC). In the present study, the efficacy of the sequential application of electron donors, supporting reductive dechlorination, and of humic acids, acting as extracellular electron shuttles facilitating the anaerobic oxidation of recalcitrant intermediates, was explored in microcosm studies. Upon one initial dose of lactose, supplied in a 1000-fold superstoichiometric electron equivalent ratio, PCE was completely converted into cis-DCE within 35 days. Repeated electron donor additions did not entail exhaustive cis-DCE degradation over incubation time (120 days). Although the electron donor was quickly converted into fatty acids, about 30% of added reducing equivalents were recovered as acetate after four months of operation, indicating the inhibition of acetoclastic methanogenesis. In the next step, the substoichiometric addition of anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate, a humic acid model compound, effected the complete removal of the accumulated cis-DCE within 15 days, probably as a result of the participation of the quinone in the biotic or abiotic anaerobic oxidation of cis-DCE. Cis-DCE degradation was not connected to the accumulation of VC, rendering the proposed two-step treatment an efficient and environmentally compliant remedy for anaerobic groundwater bodies contaminated with chlorinated solvents.",

AChE hydrolyses acetylthiocholine (ATCh) in thiocoline (TC) and acetic acid (AA). When AChE is immobilized into a paste carbon working electrode kept at +410 mV vs. Ag/AgCl electrode, the enzyme reaction rate using acetylthiocholine chloride (ATCl) as substrate is monitored as a current intensity. Because Paraoxon and Dichlorvos inhibit the AChE reaction, the decrease of the current intensity, at fixed ATCl concentration, is a measure of their concentration. Linear calibration curves for Paraoxon and Dichlorvos determination have been obtained. The detection limits resulted to be 0.86 ppb and 4.2 ppb for Paraoxon and Dichlorvos, respectively, while the extension of the linear range was up 23 ppb for the former pesticide and up to 33 ppb for the latter.

     "abstract": "Detection of low amounts of Cryptosporidium oocysts in raw water sources is considered an important component in the management, prevention and control of Cryptosporidium in drinking water supplies as Cryptosporidium causes massive waterborne outbreaks worldwide. As Cryptosporidium has a robust oocyst that is extremely resistant to chlorine and other drinking water disinfectants, both the freeze–thaw method and DNA extraction kits have been commonly used for extracting and purifying DNA from the oocyst. However, the DNA extraction procedures are time consuming and costly. Therefore, a simple and low-cost method to extract and purify DNA from the robust oocyst has been required. In this study, we discussed a simple method for detecting Cryptosporidium DNA with the anionic surfactant, n-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt (LSS) using the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to eliminate the need for the freeze–thaw method and the DNA extraction kits. As a result, Bst DNA polymerase was inhibited by 0.1% LSS but not 0.01% LSS and 5% Triton X-100 or Tween 20. Although DNA was extracted from the oocysts by incubating with 0.1% LSS at 90°C for 15 min, Bst DNA polymerase was inhibited by 0.1% LSS. The inhibition by 0.1% LSS was suppressed by adding 5% of the nonionic surfactants, Triton X-100 or Tween 20. The concentration of LSS in a LAMP tube was 0.01% while that in an incubation tube was 0.1%, because LSS in an incubation tube was diluted by a factor of 10 at the DNA amplification process. Therefore, we found that ten oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum could be detected by incubation with 0.1% LSS, without removing LSS or adding the nonionic surfactants in the LAMP method.",

It is among the first crops to be genetically transformed, and genetically modified cultivars are in commercial production at very significant levels.

To address this, we have conducted an elaborate investigation of the conditions for regenerating shoots from hypocotyl explants from four genetic lines: Invigor 5020, Westar and Topas as well as a microspore culture derived line of Topas (Line 4079). We analyzed the effect of hormonal combinations in regeneration medium, donor plant age and explant type on the regeneration capacity of these plants. The analysis showed that hypocotyls of eight-day-old seedlings grown on media supplemented with 1 mg/L dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4-D) produced the most shoots. Globular somatic embryos emerged following two weeks of 2,4-D treatment. When transferred to the medium containing 5 mg/L benzyladenine (BA), approximately 82% of embryos produced shoots within six weeks. Invigor plants were shown to regenerate more efficiently than Topas; the number of plantlets regenerated from Invigor was approximately 40–50% more as compared to Topas or Line 4079. When hypocotyl explants were co-cultivated with the Agrobacterium strain GV3101 harboring a binary vector carrying a firefly luciferase reporter gene (LUC), significant numbers of plantlets were LUC-positive in a luciferase assay.

Symbiotic mycorrhizal associations can increase the uptake and delivery of low mobility nutrients and micronutrients to the host plant because they solubilize these substances and increase their catchment area. To analyze the effect of mycorrhizae on the phytoaccumulation of Cu, we studied their ability to solubilize Cu(II) and enhance its absorption by the plant Tagetes erecta L. colonized with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradices. Plants were grown for nine weeks in a growth chamber under controlled conditions of temperature, relative humidity and photoperiod. Cu was added in the insoluble form of CuO to simulate the insoluble Cu–O affixed species in soil. The biotic and abiotic parameters of colonization, foliar area, biomass and the pH of leachates were determined as functions of the Cu concentration that was measured in the roots, shoots and leachates by AAS. The results of Cu absorption showed that the colonized plants accumulated more Cu in the roots as well as the whole plant and that both the colonized and non-colonized plants displayed the typical behavior of Cu excluders. Mycorrhizal colonization of the roots resulted in a proliferation of vesicles and this was observed to scale with root tissue Cu concentrations. Also, the G. intraradices–T. erecta system displayed a higher resistance to the toxicity induced by Cu while nonetheless improving the indices of phytoaccumulative yields. These results suggest that G. intraradices possibly accumulates Cu in its vesicles thereby enhancing the Cu tolerance of T. erecta even while increasing root Cu accumulation. The parameters of bioconcentration factor and translocation factor measured in this work suggest that the system T. erecta–G. intraradices can potentially phytostabilize Cu in contaminated soils.",

The production of hypocrellins could reach 780.6 mg/l with the addition of Triton X-100, confirmed by color reaction, high performance liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. According to our observation, treatment of the culture at the beginning of the fermentation was most effective, and the yield of hypocrellins was much lower with the addition of Triton X-100 during the log phase and stationary phase. Shiraia sp. SUPER-H168 could not produce hypocrellin with the addition of other tested surfactants, such as Tween 40, Triton X-114 and SDS. The experimental results indicated that Shiraia sp. SUPER-H168 could not produce hypocrellins without Triton X-100 under submerged fermentation condition.",

     "abstract": "The lignocellulosic biomass is a low-cost renewable resource for eco-benign liquid fuel ‘ethanol’. To resolve the hydrolysis of mixed sugars in lignocellulosic substrate Saccharum spontaneum, the microbial co-cultures of Pichia stipitis NCIM 3498 and thermotolerant Saccharomyces cerevisiae-VS3 were analyzed for efficient bioconversion of mixed sugars into ethanol. Among the hydrolysis conditions, the acid hydrolysis released maximum sugars along with furans, phenolics and acetic acid. The acidic hydrolysate was detoxified and fermented by monocultures of P. stipitis NCIM3498 (P.S.) and thermotolerant S. cerevisiae VS3 (S.C.), and co-culture of P.S. (7.5 mL) and S.C. (2.5 mL). Before the fermentation of hemicellulose acid hydrolysate, both the monocultures (P.S. and S.C.), and varying ratios of P.S. and S.C. microorganisms in co-cultures #1, #2 and #3 were grown on simulated synthetic medium. The ethanol yield from monocultures of P.S. (0.44 ± 0.021 g/g), S.C. (0.22 ± 0.01 g/g) and co-culture #3 (0.49 ± 0.02 g/g) revealed unique characteristics of each mono and co-culture technology.

     "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the suitability of low-cost carbon sources for bacteriocin production by Leuconostoc mesenteroides strain E131. For this purpose, inexpensive sugars derived from a sugar refinery plant (glucose, fructose and sucrose) as well as waste molasses were utilized as carbon sources in submerged shake-flask experiments and the kinetic response of the microorganism was evaluated. Interestingly, in the case of molasses, non-negligible decolorization-detoxification (up to ∼27%) of the residue was performed together with the production of bacteriocin. In all instances the initial concentration of sugars employed was adjusted at 20 and 30 g/L, therefore the effect of both the nature and the initial quantity of sugar upon the growth of the microorganism was assessed. All media proved to be suitable for both biomass and bacteriocin production by L. mesenteroides, whereas variable quantities of lactate, acetate and ethanol were detected into the medium. Employment of fructose, sucrose or molasses as carbon sources resulted in the accumulation of mannitol (in some cases in significant quantities) into the medium; remarkable portion thus of the available or released fructose acted as electron acceptor instead of carbon source by the microorganism. The highest bacteriocin production achieved (=640 AU/mL) was obtained when initial glucose at 30 g/L was used as substrate. Finally, utilization of waste molasses as carbon source by L. mesenteroides resulted in satisfactory bacteriocin production (up to 320 AU/mL) besides the decolorization of the residue.",

Under derived conditions, paired culturing of mutant P. oxalicum SAUE-3.510 and P. ostreatus MTCC 1804 resulted in 58% and 33% higher levels of xylanase and laccase production, respectively. A combination of sugarcane bagasse and black gram husk in a ratio of 3:1 was found to be the most ideal solid substrate and support for fungal colonization and enzyme production during co-cultivation. Maximum levels of xylanase (8205.31 ± 168.31 IU g−1) and laccase (375.53 ± 34.17 IU g−1) during SSF were obtained by using 4 g of solid support with 80% of moisture content. Furthermore, expressions of both xylanase and laccase were characterized during mixed culture by zymogram analysis. Improved levels of xylanase and laccase biosynthesis were achieved by co-culturing the mutant P. oxalicum SAUE-3.510 and P. ostreatus MTCC 1804. This may be because of efficient substrate utilization as compared to their respective monocultures in the presence of lignin degradation compounds because of synergistic action of xylanase and laccase.

The optimum media consisted of 5% (w/v) yeast extract; 18.9% (w/v) soy peptone; 5% (w/v) glycerol and 0.06% (w/v) K2HPO4. The pH, bacterial growth, concentrations of amino acids, glycerol and menaquinone-7 were measured at the optimum fermentation media each day. Total free amino acids concentration increased 1.7-fold during the fermentation. Lysine and glutamic acid were the most abundant whereas arginine, asparagine and serine were the limiting amino acids at the end of fermentation period. The menaquinone-7 concentration approached 86% of the final value in the third day of fermentation, where the bacteria growth was at exponential phase. At this condition the concentration of glycerol as carbon source and asparagine, serine and arginine as the amino acid sources were dramatically diminished in the fermentation media. The optimum menaquinone-7 concentration was in good agreement with the predicted value by the model (96% validity).

The inhibitory substance was fungistatic, and was very stable under high temperature and high or low pH value. It was soluble in ethanol or methanol, moderately soluble in water, and insoluble in acetone, ethyl acetate or ether. The inhibitor is not a protein and has no charges on its molecule. This is the first discovery of the production of a fungistatic substance by this deleterious fungus. Results from this study suggest the possession of a strong competitive saprophytic ability by A. flavus, which in turn may explain the widespread occurrence of this fungus in soils.

DcHsp17.7 was constitutively expressed in leaf and stem tissues under normal growth conditions. Upon exposure to 300 mM NaCl, the protein level of DcHsp17.7 increased dramatically in leaf tissue, but did not significantly change in stem tissue. Native-PAGE analysis showed tissue-specific oligomer formation. Under normal growth conditions, DcHsp17.7 was found in an approximately 240 kDa complex in both tissues. However, NaCl treatment induced an additional approximately 160 kDa complex containing DcHsp17.7. This occurred only in leaf tissue, suggesting tissue-specific oligomeric complex formation. To examine the functional mechanism of DcHsp17.7 under stress conditions, the DcHsp17.7 coding gene was introduced into Escherichia coli. Heterologous expression of DcHsp17.7 was induced by isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside treatment. Upon exposure to salinity, protein levels of DcHsp17.7 decreased, and the protein was not detected after 16 hours. Native-PAGE analysis showed that DcHsp17.7 was present in an approximately 250 kDa complex both before and after salt treatment. Salinity reduced bacterial cell viability; however, the transgenic E. coli expressing DcHsp17.7 exhibited a higher survival rate than control E. coli under salt stress. When the level of soluble proteins was measured under salt stress, transgenic E. coli expressing DcHsp17.7 reproducibly showed slightly higher levels than control cells. This suggests that DcHsp17.7 performs molecular chaperone activity in salt-stressed transgenic E. coli. Our results suggest that DcHsp17.7 is likely to be involved in tolerance not only to thermal stresses but also to other abiotic stresses, such as salinity.",

Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive than were Gram-negative bacteria. The vegetative cells of B. cereus were the most sensitive among the pathogens tested with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.036 mg/μl of propolis on agar medium. Based on MIC, sensitivity of vegetative cells of B. cereus and its spores was tested in a nutrient broth with different concentrations of propolis at 37°C.

     "abstract": "Of six alkalitolerant, extracellular protease producing bacterial strains isolated, DP2 displayed maximum activity. This organism was designated as Streptomyces sp. DP2 and identified as Streptomyces ambofaciens. Maximum protease yield was observed after 48 hours of submerged fermentation using various carbon and nitrogen sources. Fructose was found to be the best substrate for protease production, followed by maltose, lactose and wheat bran. Mustard cake is reported for the first time as the most ideal nitrogen source although soybean meal also gave comparable yield. The protease produced by Streptomyces sp. DP2 exhibited extensive activity over a broad pH range (4–12) with maximum activity at pH 8, and was active over a broad range of elevated temperatures (50–100°C), and possessed thermostability at 60–90°C for up to 1 hour. Enzyme activity was reduced by EDTA (25%), SDS (16%), and PMSF (6%). This novel alkaline protease has both alkali- and thermostability that may have industrial significance.",

And the result shows that the initial pH, moisture content and culture temperature all have significant effect on the production of cellulase. The optimized condition shall be initial pH 5.7, moisture content 72% and culture temperature 30°C. The maximum cellulase (FPA) production was obtained under the optimized condition, which is 5.76 IU g−1, increased by 44.12% to its original strain.

Most of these compounds exert health-promoting effects seem to attribute to their antioxidant activity. Metallothioneins (MT) has been suggested to protect against acute heavy metal toxicity in the liver, and the proteins of MT can be induced by various stimuli including antioxidant. Measuring the induction of MT genes may provide an efficient approach to understand the chemopreventive mechanisms of flavonoids. The antioxidant activity of eight flavonoids was determined by TEAC and ORAC assays and their effects on MT protein were also measured. HepG2 cells were employed to explore the mechanisms underlying flavonoid-induced MT induction. Statistical analysis revealed a positive correlation between the antioxidant activity of flavonoids and MT expression. Quercetin-induced MT expression may function by activating the phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and PI3K/Akt as well as by enhancing Nrf2 DNA-binding activity. Moreover, quercetin exhibited a potential protective effect on t-BHP-caused injury in hepatocytes through the induction of MT. These results suggest that quercetin is a natural antioxidant in the diet and the consumption of foods that are rich in quercetin could be beneficial for the prevention of environmental oxidant-induced liver damage.",

     "abstract": "In the present study, interactions between the duration of treatment with auxin and different cytokinins and their effect on shoot regeneration were evaluated with the aim to establish a rapid and efficient in vitro regeneration method applicable to a variety of Populus species. Three different species, Populus angustifolia, P. balsamifera, and P. deltoids, were chosen for that purpose. We were successful in regenerating plantlets from stem and petiole explants from all three chosen species using a four-step simple procedure. The first step was callus induction when the explants were exposed to an auxin-rich medium for 0–20 days. During the second step, they were transferred onto a cytokinin-rich medium for shoot bud induction. In the third step, the shoots regenerated were transferred onto a medium with reduced levels of cytokinins to promote shoot proliferation and elongation; finally, in the fourth step, the shoots were rooted and acclimated. A short period (6–10 days) of time of exposure to auxin was sufficient for shoot regeneration. A culture time longer than ten days in callus induction medium drastically reduced the efficiency of shoot regeneration. Besides, cytokinin type and concentration also affected the frequency of shoot induction. A 0.2 mg/l concentration of 2,4-D for callus induction followed by 0.02 mg/l of Thidiazuron for shoot formation proved to be the best treatment for adventitious shoot bud multiplication, generating a maximum of 10–13 shoots of P. balsamifera and P. angustifolia in ten weeks. In contrast, for P. deltoids, a combination of 1.1 mg/l 2,4-D, 1.0 mg/l NAA, 0.1 mg/l zeatin for callus induction followed by a combination of 1 mg/l zeatin plus 1.0 mg/l BA for shoot bud induction was found to be the most effective, generating on average 15 shoots over a period of ten weeks.",

     "abstract": "In plants, flowering as a crucial developmental event is highly regulated by both genetic programs and environmental signals. Genetic analysis of flowering time mutants is instrumental in dissecting the regulatory pathways of flowering induction. In this study, we isolated the OsLF gene by its association with the T-DNA insertion in the rice late flowering mutant named A654. The OsLF gene encodes an atypical HLH protein composed of 419 amino acids (aa). Overexpression of the OsLF gene in wild type rice recapitulated the late flowering phenotype of A654, indicating that the OsLF gene negatively regulates flowering. Flowering genes downstream of OsPRR1 such as OsGI and Hd1 were down regulated in the A654 mutant. Yeast two hybrid and colocalization assays revealed that OsLF interacts strongly with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 that are potentially involved in light signaling. In addition, OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 colocalize with OsPRR1, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis APRR1 gene that controls photoperiodic flowering response through clock function. Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and Hd1 by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 and thus induce late flowering.",

One complete ORF encoding 691 amino acids (2076 bp) was the structural gene, LacA (galA) of the β-gal gene. The recombinant enzyme shown by activity staining and gel-filtration chromatography was composed of a homodimer of 75 kDa with a total molecular mass of 150 kDa. The Km value for lactose (95.58 mM) was 52.5-fold higher than the corresponding Km values for the synthetic substrate ONPG (1.82 mM). This enzyme with the optimum of pH 7.0 and 45°C could synthesize approximately 42.00% of GOS from 1 M of lactose.

It had all features of xylanase enzyme and showed homology to xylanases reported from B. subtilis. It differs from the earlier reported xylanase sequences by the presence of more serine residues compared to threonine and also by the presence of polar (hydrophilic) amino acids in higher abundance (61%) than non-polar amino acids (39%).

     "abstract": "Antibody preparations have a long history of providing protection from infectious diseases. Although antibodies remain the only natural host-derived defense mechanism capable of completely preventing infection, as products, they compete against inexpensive therapeutics such as antibiotics, small molecule inhibitors and active vaccines. The continued discovery in the monoclonal antibody (mAb) field of leads with broadened cross neutralization of viruses and demonstrable synergy of antibody with antibiotics for bacterial diseases, clearly show that innovation remains. The commercial success of mAbs in chronic disease has not been paralleled in infectious diseases for several reasons. Infectious disease immunotherapeutics are limited in scope as endemic diseases necessitate active vaccine development. Also, the complexity of these small markets draws the interest of niche companies rather than big pharmaceutical corporations. Lastly, the cost of goods for mAb therapeutics is inherently high for infectious agents due to the need for antibody cocktails, which better mimic polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations and prevent antigenic escape. In cases where vaccine or convalescent populations are available, current polyclonal hyperimmune immunoglobulin preparations (pIgG), with modern and highly efficient purification technology and standardized assays for potency, can make economic sense. Recent innovations to broaden the potency of mAb therapies, while reducing cost of production, are discussed herein. On the basis of centuries of effective use of Ab treatments, and with growing immunocompromised populations, the question is not whether antibodies have a bright future for infectious agents, but rather what formats are cost effective and generate safe and efficacious treatments to satisfy regulatory approval.",

     "abstract": "The “4D Biology Workshop for Health and Disease”, held on 16–17th of March 2010 in Brussels, aimed at finding the best organising principles for large-scale proteomics, interactomics and structural genomics/biology initiatives, and setting the vision for future high-throughput research and large-scale data gathering in biological and medical science.Major conclusions of the workshop include the following. (i) Development of new technologies and approaches to data analysis is crucial. Biophysical methods should be developed that span a broad range of time/spatial resolution and characterise structures and kinetics of interactions. Mathematics, physics, computational and engineering tools need to be used more in biology and new tools need to be developed. (ii) Database efforts need to focus on improved definitions of ontologies and standards so that system-scale data and associated metadata can be understood and shared efficiently. (iii) Research infrastructures should play a key role in fostering multidisciplinary research, maximising knowledge exchange between disciplines and facilitating access to diverse technologies. (iv) Understanding disease on a molecular level is crucial. System approaches may represent a new paradigm in the search for biomarkers and new targets in human disease. (v) Appropriate education and training should be provided to help efficient exchange of knowledge between theoreticians, experimental biologists and clinicians. These conclusions provide a strong basis for creating major possibilities in advancing research and clinical applications towards personalised medicine.",

     "publication date": "07-2011",
     "abstract": "cAMP (Adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate) is a general second messenger controlling distinct targets in eukaryotic cells. In a (sub)proteomic approach, two classes of phosphorothioate cAMP affinity tools were used to isolate and to identify signalling complexes of the main cAMP target, cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA). Agonist analogues (here: Sp-cAMPS) bind to the regulatory subunits of PKA (PKA-R), together with their interaction partners, and cause dissociation of a holoenzyme complex comprising PKA-R and catalytic subunits of PKA (PKA-C). Antagonist analogues (here: Rp-cAMPS) bind to the holoenzyme without dissociating the complex and were developed to identify interaction partners that bind to the entire complex or to PKA-C. More than 80 different proteins were isolated from tissue extracts including several PKA isoforms and known as well as potentially new interaction partners. Nevertheless, unspecific binding of general nucleotide binding proteins limited the outcome of this chemical proteomics approach. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was employed to optimise the entire workflow of pull down proteomics and to quantify the effects of different nucleotides (ATP, ADP, GTP and NADH) on PKA-R binding to affinity material. We could demonstrate that the addition of NADH to lysates improved specificity in pull down experiments. Using a combination of SPR studies and pull down experiments it was shown unambiguously that it is possible to specifically elute protein complexes with cAMP or cGMP from cAMPS analogue matrices. The side-by-side analysis of the PKA-R interactome and the holoenzyme complexed with interacting proteins will contribute to a further dissection of the multifaceted PKA signalling network.",

Phage display offers many advantages compared to antibody generation by immunisation because it is an unlimited resource of affinity reagents without batch-to-batch variation and is also amendable for high throughput in contrast to conventional hybridoma technology. One of the major bottlenecks to proteome-wide binder selection is the limited supply of suitable target antigens representative of the human proteome. Here, we provide proof of principle of using easily accessible, cancer-associated protein epitope signature tags (PrESTs), routinely generated within the Human Protein Atlas project, as surrogate antigens for full-length proteins in phage selections for the retrieval of target-specific binders. These binders were subsequently tested in western blot, immunohistochemistry and protein microarray application to demonstrate their functionality.",

We have reported that chick dorsal root ganglion (DRG)-conditioned medium (CM) promoted the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells into motor neurons. We investigated the formation of undifferentiated iPS cell colonies and the differentiation of iPS cells into neurons using DRG-CM. When iPS cells were cultured in DMEM containing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), the iPS cells appeared to be maintained in an undifferentiated state for 19 passages. The number of iPS cell colonies (200 μm in diameter) was maximal at six days of cultivation and the colonies were maintained in an undifferentiated state, but the iPS cell colonies at ten days of cultivation had hollows inside the colonies and were differentiated. By contrast, the number of ES cell colonies (200 μm in diameter) was maximal at ten days of cultivation. The iPS cells were able to proliferate and differentiate easily into various cell lineages, compared to ES cells. When iPS cell colonies were cultured in a manner similar to ES cells with DMEM/F-12K medium supplemented with DRG-CM, the iPS cells mainly differentiated into motor and sensory neurons. These results suggested that the differentiation properties of iPS cells differ from those of ES cells.",

It also interacts with BS69 and HP1b, both of which are involved in chromatin remodelling, and with NIF-1 and DBC-1 in the regulation of nuclear receptor-mediated transcription. Here we investigate the function of EMSY during amphibian development, and in doing so provide the first loss-of-function analysis of this protein. Injection of Xenopus tropicalis embryos with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides targeting XtEMSY impairs gastrulation movements, disrupts dorsal structures, and kills embryos by tailbud stages. Consistent with these observations, regional markers such as Xbra, Chd, Gsc, Shh, Sox3 and Sox17 are downregulated. In contrast to these regional markers, expression of p53 is upregulated in such embryos, and at later stages Bax expression is elevated and apoptotic cells can be detected. Our results demonstrate that EMSY has an essential role in development and they provide an in vivo loss-of-function model that might be used to explore the biochemical functions of this protein in more detail.",

The preparation, optimization and application of the developed microbial biosensor, which analyzed Pb(II), are presented. The method was based on stripping of adsorbed metal ions from the modified electrode surface. Modified carbon paste electrodes were preconcentrated at open circuit, and then electrochemically measured by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse stripping voltammetry (DPSV) techniques. It was found that the thermally dried cells were capable of adsorbing Pb(II) ions from aqueous solutions and could determine the ions prominently at optimum experimental conditions. Many important parameters to acquire the best electrochemical response were carried out, including effect of different electrolyte solutions, pH, deposition potential, deposition time, ionic strength, preconcentration time, and effect of interference ions. Finally, a calibration graph was obtained with a linear range from 1.0 × 10−6 to 2.0 × 10−5 M Pb(II) (R2 = 0.9916) and detection limit was found as 6.0 × 10−7 M Pb(II) by using 3 × Sb/m formula.

These included effluent from seafood processing plant and molasses from sugar cane plant. In the mixed culture, the yeast grew faster and the lipid production was higher than that in the pure cultures. This could be because microalga acted as an oxygen generator for yeast, while yeast provided CO2 to microalga and both carried out the production of lipids. The optimal conditions for lipid production by the mixed culture were as follows: ratio of yeast to microalga at 1:1; initial pH at 5.0; molasses concentration at 1%; shaking speed at 200 rpm; and light intensity at 5.0 klux under 16:8 hours light and dark cycles. Under these conditions, the highest biomass of 4.63 ± 0.15 g/L and lipid production of 2.88 ± 0.16 g/L were obtained after five days of cultivation.

The final construction was integrated into the genome of the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris X33 and the ability to produce xylanase activity was evaluated in flask cultures. Recombinant P. pastoris efficiently secreted xylanase into the medium and produced high level of enzymatic activity (110 U/ml) after 216 hours of growth, under methanol induction. To achieve higher enzyme production, the influence of initial pH, methanol concentration, agitation and flask design was evaluated.

     "publication date": "07-2011",
     "abstract": "The high cost of commercial lipases limits their industrial application in the production of biodiesel or fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). This disadvantage has encouraged the search for lipase-producing microorganisms (LPMs) as potential whole cell catalysts for FAME production. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate innovative procedures for easy selection and testing of LPMs as a low-cost whole cell catalyst, based on catalytic performance, methanol tolerance and physico-chemical cell surface properties. The latter (in particular the cell surface hydrophobicity and charge) were analyzed because of their crucial role in microbial adhesion to surfaces and the concomitant increase in cell immobilization and bioavailability of hydrophobic substrates. Biocatalysis experiments performed in the presence of nutrient, rapeseed oil and methanol were an effective tool for studying and identifying, in just two experiments, the capacity of different LPMs as biocatalysts in organic media, as well as the methanol tolerance of the cell and the lipase. This indicates the potential for using live microorganisms for FAME production. Another finding was that the inhibitory effect of methanol is more significant for lipase activity than LPM growth, indicating that the way in which alcohol is supplied to the reaction is a crucial step in FAME production by biocatalysts. According to these results, the application of these innovative assessments should simplify the search for new strains which are able to effectively catalyze the FAME production process.",

Mixing, gas transfer, and volumetric power consumption (PV) were determined in both a 5-L OSR and a 3-L stirred-tank bioreactor (STR). The two cultivation systems had a similar mixing intensity, but the STR had a lower volumetric mass transfer coefficient of oxygen (kLa) and a higher PV than the OSR. Recombinant CHO cell lines expressing either tumor necrosis factor receptor as an Fc fusion protein (TNFR:Fc) or an anti-RhesusD monoclonal antibody were cultivated in the two systems. The 5-L OSR was operated in an incubator shaker with 5% CO2 in the gas environment but without pH and DO control whereas the STR was operated with or without pH and DO control. Higher cell densities and recombinant protein titers were obtained in the OSR as compared to both the controlled and the non-controlled STRs. To test the reproducibility of a bioprocess in a non-controlled OSR, the two CHO cell lines were each cultivated in parallel in six 5-L OSRs. Similar cell densities, cell viabilities, and recombinant protein titers along with similar pH and DO profiles were achieved in each group of replicates. Our study demonstrated that bioprocesses can be performed in OSRs without pH or DO control in a highly reproducible manner, at least at the scale of operation studied here.",

For 14 years farmers from a range of countries across the globe have been accessing transgenic technologies either to reduce crop production costs, increase yield and/or to exploit a range of rotational benefits. In 2009 134 Mha of transgenic crops was grown. The arable area of the EU 27 is approximately 102 Mha; however, only about 0.1 Mha of transgenic crops, mainly maize in Spain, is grown in the EU. This is in part due to limited approvals before the establishment of a moratorium on the cultivation of transgenic crops. In this paper we estimate the revenue foregone by EU farmers, based on the potential hectarages of IR and HT transgenic crops that have been economically successful elsewhere if they were to be grown in areas of the EU where farmers could expect an overall financial benefit. This benefit would accrue primarily from reduced input costs. We estimate that if the areas of transgenic maize, cotton, soya, oil seed rape and sugar beet were to be grown where there is agronomic need or benefit then farmer margins would increase by between €443 and €929 M/year. It is noted that this margin of revenue foregone is likely to increase if the current level of approval and growth remains low, as new transgenic events come to market and are rapidly taken up by farmers in other parts of the world.",

Various cycles of backcrossing and/or selfing were utilized to isolate plants carrying addition of three A-genome chromosomes in the background of B. nigra. These chromosome addition stocks were characterized by chromosome counts, pollen and seed fertility and chromosome specific microsatellite (SSRs) markers. The chromosome number in different backcross/self generations ranged between 2n = 26 and 2n = 19 with relatively high frequency of univalents (8-10I) at in meiotic configurations observed, suggesting the role of preferential transmission of A-genome chromosomes. SSRs analysis revealed that B. rapa chromosomes 3 and 4 were the first to get eliminated followed by chromosome 10. Remaining chromosomes were maintained till BC1F4.

Results show that three and four proteins respectively showed a trend toward solubilization and insolubilization, which indicates the possibility that the theoretically designed sequence can control protein solubility.",

Cell-free protein expression has become a valuable alternative to cell-based methods, and allows today the expression of milligram quantities of protein. Its use is particularly attractive for NMR studies as it allows a multitude of isotopic labeling schemes. We have implemented and further developed protocols to prepare cell-free extracts from wheat germ to produce recombinant protein for solid-state NMR studies. Furthermore, we established the Renilla luciferase model to optimise and evaluate extract quality, and report first productions of the prions Ure2p and HET-s devoted to structural studies currently ongoing in our laboratories.",

The Protemist XE was also capable of membrane protein translation. Thus human sigma-1 receptor was translated in the presence of unilamellar liposomes and bacteriorhodopsin was translated directly into detergent micelles in the presence of all-trans-retinal. The versatility, ease of use, and compact size of the Protemist XE robot demonstrate its suitability for large-scale synthesis of many classes of proteins.",

     "abstract": "The production of membrane proteins in cellular systems is besieged by several problems due to their hydrophobic nature which often causes misfolding, protein aggregation and cytotoxicity, resulting in poor yields of stable proteins. Cell-free expression has emerged as one of the most versatile alternatives for circumventing these obstacles by producing membrane proteins directly into designed hydrophobic environments. Efficient optimisation of expression and solubilisation conditions using a variety of detergents, membrane mimetics and lipids has yielded structurally and functionally intact membrane proteins, with yields several fold above the levels possible from cell-based systems. Here we review recently developed techniques available to produce functional membrane proteins, and discuss amphipols, nanodisc and styrene maleic acid lipid particle (SMALP) technologies that can be exploited alongside cell-free expression of membrane proteins.",

Since then, many efforts have been made to optimise this technique and, recently, to adapt it to membrane protein production with yields compatible with structural investigations. The versatility of the method allows membrane proteins to be obtained directly stabilised in surfactant micelles or inserted in a lipidic environment (proteoliposome, bicelle, and nanodisc) at the end of synthesis. Among the surfactants used, non-detergent ones such as fluorinated surfactants proved to be a good alternative in terms of colloidal stability and preservation of the integrity of membrane proteins, as shown for Escherichia coli homo-pentameric channel, MscL (Park et al., Biochem. J., 403: 183–187). Here we report cell-free expression of Escherichia coli leader peptidase (a transmembrane protease), Halobacterium salinarium bacteriorhodopsin (a transmembrane protein binding a hydrophobic cofactor) and E. coli MscL in the presence of non-detergent surfactants, amphipols and fluorinated surfactants in comparison to their expression in classical detergents. The results confirm the potentialities of fluorinated surfactants and, although pointing to limitations in using the first generations amphipols, results are discussed in the light of membrane protein refolding, especially in the case of bacteriorhodopsin. Preliminary experiments using new generations of amphipols supports choices made in developing new molecules.",

Seed content for the bioactive compounds diosgenin, galactomannan and 4-hydroxyisoleucine was characterized for ten fenugreek genotypes under rainfed and irrigated conditions. High and low seed yielding genotype/environment combinations were identified that possessed distinct biochemical and seed production traits. In general high seed yielding genotype/environment combinations exhibited a more stable biochemical composition and consisted largely of irrigated fenugreek.

     "abstract": "Corn bran is mainly made up of the pericarp of corn kernels and is a byproduct stream resulting from the wet milling step in corn starch processing. Through statistic modeling this study examined the optimization of pretreatment of corn bran for enzymatic hydrolysis. A low pH pretreatment (pH 2, 150°C, 65 min) boosted the enzymatic release of xylose and glucose and maximized biomass solubilization. With more acidic pretreatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis the total xylose release was maximized (at pH 1.3) reaching ∼50% by weight of the original amount present in destarched corn bran, but the enzyme catalyzed xylose release was maximal after pretreatment at approx. pH 2. The total glucose release peaked after pretreatment of approx. pH 1.5 with an enzymatic release of approx. 68% by weight of the original amounts present in destarched corn bran. For arabinose the enzymatic release was negatively affected by the acidic pretreatment as labile arabinosyl-linkages were presumably hydrolysed directly during the pretreatment. A maximum of 60% arabinose release was achieved directly from the optimal (acidic) pretreatment. The total content of diferulic acids, supposedly involved in the cross-linking of the arabinoxylan polymers, decreased by both alkaline and acidic pretreatment pH, with the loss by alkaline pretreatments being highest. No direct correlation between the enzymatic release of xylose and the content of diferulic acids in the substrate could be verified. On the contrary the enzymatic release of xylose was significantly correlated to the total release of arabinose, indicating that the degree of arabinosyl-substitutions on the xylan backbone is an essential parameter for enzymatic hydrolysis of corn bran arabinoxylan.",

Higher growth was observed on feather-containing or tryptone (TR) medium when compared to casein (CA) or glucose-nitrogen (GN) base medium. Protease production occurred during growth on feather-containing and TR media, whereas no protease activity was detected on CA or GN medium, indicating that protease production is not constitutive, depending on the presence of specific complex nitrogen sources. Supplementation of whole feathers (WF) medium with glucose (WFG) or NH4Cl (WFN) did not result in major differences in growth and protease production, whereas soluble protein was lower in supplemented media. Glucose consumption and growth were higher on WFG than on GN medium, suggesting that the absence of a specific complex nitrogen source limited bacterial growth. On WF medium, this strain grew closely attached to the feather structures, initially on the barbules and subsequently on the feather rachis. It was observed, through zymogram analysis, that strain kr6 produced diverse proteolytic enzymes in response to different growth substrates.

The lipase purified in this study through acetone precipitation and three-step chromatography was estimated to be about 11 kDa in size by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, and it tended to form large aggregates in aqueous solution. The purified lipase retained its activity over wide ranges of pH (2–12) and temperature (20–80°C). Its activity was enhanced by the Ca2+ ion and reduced by some heavy metal ions, such as Zn2+ and Hg2+, and diethylpyrocarbonate. Among the various substrates tested, monoacylglycerols containing long-chain unsaturated fatty acids and phosphatidylcholine were preferentially hydrolyzed over triacylglycerols and fatty acid methyl esters. The lipase strongly hydrolyzed the sn-1/3 ester bonds and weakly hydrolyzed the sn-2 ester bonds of triolein, and it also catalyzed the acylglycerol synthesis reaction in a solvent-free two-phase system. The results indicate that triacylglycerol may be formed via 2-monoacylglycerol. Thus, the highly stable M. alliacea lipase may be useful for the synthesis of structured lipids, particularly acylglycerols containing functional unsaturated fatty acids at the sn-2 position.",

Under the optimum reaction conditions, the yields of phosphatidyl-tyrosol, hydroquinone (HQ), 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanol (4APE), h-tyrosol and 2-phenylethanol (PEA) were 87 ± 3.7, 13 ± 1.3, 90 ± 2.3, 64 ± 5.5 and 85 ± 1.0 mol%, respectively. Furthermore, from the results of transphosphatidylation of soyPC with several phenylethanols and phenylpropanols, we established the following details about the reaction specificity of transphosphatidylation by PLD from Streptomyces sp.: (1) para-amino and para-hydroxyl groups in the benzene ring of PEA derivatives do not affect the transphosphatidylation by PLD, whereas meta-hydroxyl group slightly inhibits the transphosphatidylation. (2) Meta- and ortho-methyl groups in the benzene ring of PEA derivatives also slightly inhibit the transphosphatidylation. (3) Secondary and tertiary alcohols and hydroquinone are difficult to transphosphatidylate by PLD.",

However, these properties can only be exerted if the SLs can be introduced to the bacterial cells in an acceptable manner. Propionibacterium acnes is the common bacterial cause of acne. It is a Gram+ facultative anaerobe that is susceptible to the antimicrobial effects of SLs. In this study we demonstrated that different biopolymer matrices could be used to produce SL composite films that exert various antimicrobial efficiencies against P. acnes. Increasing SL concentrations in poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and PHB-co-10%-3-hydroxyhexanoate (PHB/HHx) resulted in noticeably improved (PHB/HHx was best) antimicrobial activity based on the size of the zones of inhibition using an overlay plating technique on synthetic growth medium. However, increasing concentrations of SLs in PHB and PHB/HHx films also increased film opacity, which diminishes the appeal for use especially in visible (facial) areas. Pectin and alginate improved the transparent character of SL composite films while also acting as successful carriers of SLs to P. acnes. The lactone form of the SLs proved to exhibit the best antimicrobial action and in concert with either pectin or alginate biopolymers provided a comparatively transparent, successful means of utilizing SLs as a renewable, environmentally benign anti-acne solution.",

Because the heteroduplex mobility of a tested strain shows a unique banding pattern that is the function of the sequence of the referred strain, we further explored the potential use of heteroduplex DNA patterns (HPs) as DNA fingerprints for the identification of these fungi. The 29 Colletotrichum strains previously identified by HMA to be taxonomic members of CG, CA, CM, CC and CL species groups were re-examined with an emphasis on their unique heteroduplex banding patterns. The species attributes of these tested strains were characterized by HMA using ITS fragments amplified from six representative Colletotrichum strains as pairwise compared references. By comparing the unique homoduplex and heteroduplex banding patterns of each tested strain on a polyacrylamide gel with those of the respective reference strain, the species identity of tested strains was determined. The obtained barcode-like HPs classified these 29 Colletotrichum strains into 6 distinctive groups: CG1, CG2, CA, CM, CC and CL. Notably, the HPs differentiated strains CG1 and CG2, which differed in their ITS sequences by only six bases. The presented results revealed that the species-characteristic barcode-like HP classification of ITS regions is a relatively rapid and valuable system for species identification of Colletotrichum species. The potential use of the established barcode-like system for the identification of anthracnose fungi and other fungal pathogens is discussed.",

Conidia produced in this way were spherical with sizes ranging from 10 to 20 μm in diameter. Artificial conidia were sensitive to soil fungistasis. Young hyphae originated from artificial conidia were also sensitive to fungistasis and mycolysis in soils. These results demonstrate that the previously reported insensitivity of R. solani to fungistasis and mycolysis in soils is due to special ability of propagules used rather than the inherited nature of the organism. Germination rates of artificial conidia on soils were inversely correlated with the amount of fungicide Flutolanil added. When germination of artificial conidia was used to detect suppressive soils, 3 out of 30 soil samples collected from different parts of Taiwan were suppressive to R. solani and all these suppressive soils were low in pH. Using artificial conidia for assay of fungicide activity in soil and detection of suppressive soils has the advantages of being fast and precise in comparison with relative hyphal growth.

This crossover research results in a body of work that is based substantially on a relatively naïve, untutored approach to human behavioural science rather than on a thorough grounding in the subject. This paper describes, with examples, the potential for fundamental conceptual and methodological deficiencies to give rise to apparently plausible but misguided conclusions about consumer attitudes and behaviour and how they could be influenced.

Currently published pretreatment strategies span over a wide range of reaction conditions involving different pH values, temperatures, types of catalysts and holding times. The consequences of the pretreatment on lignocellulosic biomass are described with special emphasis on the chemical alterations of the biomass during pretreatment, especially highlighting the significance of the pretreatment pH. We present a new illustration of the pretreatment effects encompassing the differential responses to the pH and temperature. A detailed evaluation of the use of severity factor calculations for pretreatment comparisons signifies that the multiple effects of different pretreatment factors on the subsequent monosaccharide yields after enzymatic hydrolysis cannot be reliably compared by a one-dimensional severity factor, even within the same type of pretreatment strategy. However, a quantitative comparison of published data for wheat straw pretreatment illustrates that there is some correlation between the hydrolysis yields (glucose and xylose) and the pretreatment pH, but no correlation with the pretreatment temperature (90–200°C). A better recognition and understanding of the factors affecting biomatrix opening, and use of more standardized evaluation protocols, will allow for the identification of new pretreatment strategies that improve biomass utilization and permit rational enzymatic hydrolysis of the cellulose.",

     "publication date": "12-2010",
     "abstract": "In order to understand how biological systems function it is necessary to determine the interactions and associations between proteins. Some proteins, involved in a common biological process and encoded by separate genes in one organism, can be found fused within a single protein chain in other organisms. By detecting these triplets, a functional relationship can be established between the unfused proteins. Here we use a domain fusion prediction method to predict these protein interactions for the human interactome. We observed that gene fusion events are more related to physical interaction between proteins than to other weaker functional relationships such as participation in a common biological pathway. These results suggest that domain fusion is an appropriate method for predicting protein complexes.The most reliable fused domain predictions were used to build protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks. These predicted PPI network models showed the same topological features as real biological networks and different features from random behaviour. We built the PPI domain fusion sub-network model of the human kinetochore and observed that the majority of the predicted interactions have not yet been experimentally characterised in the publicly available PPI repositories. The study of the human kinetochore domain fusion sub-network reveals undiscovered kinetochore proteins with presumably relevant functions, such as hubs with many connections in the kinetochore sub-network. These results suggest that experimentally hidden regions in the predicted PPI networks contain key functional elements, associated with important functional areas, still undiscovered in the human interactome. Until novel experiments shed light on these hidden regions; domain fusion predictions provide a valuable approach for exploring them.",

In comparison to other technologies, the employment of S. spallanzanii in waste treatment represents a more attractive option to reduce bacterial loads.",

     "abstract": "Owing to the significant interest in biofuel production in the form of biodiesel, vast amount of glycerol as a waste product is produced all over the world. Among the economically viable and ecologically acceptable solutions for the safe disposal of this waste, biotechnological conversion of glycerol into a valuable bioplastic raw material, namely 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) seems to be very promising. In this study, 1,3-PDO production potential of Clostridium saccharobutylicum NRRL B-643 was studied and the results were compared with other types of anaerobic microorganisms (Clostridium spp., Pantoea agglomerans, Ochrobactrum anthropi, Chyreseomonas luteola, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and aerobic microorganisms (Lactobacillus spp.). The results were important for understanding the significance of C. saccharobutylicum NRRL B-643 among other well-known 1,3-PDO producer species. According to the screening results only C. saccharobutylicum (B-643) was able to consume feed glycerol almost entirely. However, 1,3-PDO production yield was found to be 0.36 mol/mol which is lower than that of Clostiridium beijerinckii (B-593). B-593 showed the highest value of production yields with 0.54 mol/mol. This microorganism is seen as a promising type for further 1,3-PDO studies, because it has the highest substrate utilization percentage among others. In this regard, this microorganism may have an important role in tolerating and converting glycerol during fermentation into 1,3-PDO.",

Process conditions in kraft pulp bleaching generally favour an enzyme that is active at high pH values. The activities of several glycosyl hydrolase family 11 xylanases reported to be active under alkaline conditions were determined under optimal conditions and found to have optima in the pH 5–6 range. Only one enzyme tested, BadX, was shown to have an alkaline pH optimum. Significant activity at pH values higher than 8 appears often to be the result of excess enzyme added to the reaction mixtures so that substrate is limiting. The different nature of laboratory and industrial substrates needs to be taken into consideration in designing assay conditions. In some cases, significant differences were observed in pH profiles generated using a small-molecule substrate when compared to those generated using xylan. We conclude that small-molecule substrates are not a suitable proxy for determining the pH profiles of family 11 xylanases.",

One enzyme, BadX, had enhanced activity at pHs greater than 7 compared to other family 11 xylanases.

Segment substitution using degenerate oligonucleotide gene shuffling (DOGS) experiments with combinations of input parental gene fragments from xynB6 and badX was not able to improve the activity of XynB6 at alkaline pH. With one exception, the replacement of a single segment of BadX with the equivalent segment from XynB6 reduced the alkaline activity BadX. The results indicate that it might not be possible to alter significantly the alkaline pH characteristics of family 11 xylanases by one or a few mutations and that family 11 xylanases showing enhanced activity at alkaline pH's require multiple sequence adaptations across the protein.",

The cellulase and xylanase enzymatic cocktail was characterized in terms of pH and temperature by using response surface methodology. Thermostability and kinetic parameters were also determined. The statistical analysis of pH and temperature effects on enzymatic activity showed a synergistic interaction of these two variables, thus enabling to find a pH and temperature range in which the enzymes have a higher activity. The results obtained allowed the construction of mathematical models used to predict endoglucanase, β-glucosidase and xylanase activities under different pH and temperature conditions. Optimum temperature values for all three enzymes were found to be in the range between 35°C and 60°C, and the optimum pH range was found between 4 and 5.5.

Indeed, it has become clear that it is in the general interest of science and especially of applied research to inform the public of its advances. A promising next step is to strengthen biotechnology communication in scholastic institutions. In this paper, we investigate the perception of biotechnology in a specific target group, namely high-school students in the 16–20-year-old age range. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey on a total of 1410 students in six European countries to investigate students’ perception, concern, scientific knowledge, and awareness. Our data revealed some unexpected patterns of acceptance and concern about biotechnology. Knowledge analysis indicated that pupils lack specific knowledge about biotechnological applications and their interest in biotechnology appeared to be linked to knowledge. Analysis of specific questions about teaching practices at schools suggests that a better targeted choice in media as vehicles for information together with selected speakers could be instrumental in increasing students’ interest in science and more specifically in biotechnology.",

In addition, between 15 and 18 million people worldwide are afflicted with this potentially lethal disease. Despite these devastating numbers, less than 0.5% of worldwide research and development for neglected diseases was aimed at Chagas’ disease. The aim of this review is to draw the attention of biotechnologists to the intriguing parasite that causes Chagas’ disease, which is T. cruzi. Additionally, we would also like to convince the community that basic science research can have a profound impact on the diagnosis and treatment of Chagas’ disease. In this review, we introduce distinct features of T. cruzi such as its complex life cycle (e.g. the potentially infective extracellular amastigote form), its genome and genomics, as well as proteomic analysis of this parasite. Notably, the PIK pathway has been widely acknowledged as an excellent target for drug discovery to combat this pathogen.

The cause of this delay is exclusively GE-regulation. Considering the potential impact of Golden Rice on the reduction in vitamin A-malnutrition, this delay is responsible for an unjustifiable loss of millions of lives, mostly children and women. GE-regulation is also responsible for the fact that no public institution can deliver a public good GE-product and that thus we have a de facto monopoly in favour of a few potent industries. Considering the forgone benefits from prevented public good GE-products, GE-regulation is responsible for hundreds of millions of lives, all of them, of course, in developing countries. As there is no scientific justification for present GE-regulation, and as it has, so far, not prevented any harm, our society has the urgent responsibility to reconsider present regulation, which is based on an extreme interpretation of the precautionary principle, and change it to science-based regulation on the basis of traits instead of technology.

In recent years several molecular networks concerned with stress perception, signal transduction and stress responses in plants have been elucidated. Consequently, engineering some of the genes involved in these mechanisms promises to enhance plant tolerance to stresses and in particular increase their water use efficiency.

     "abstract": "Plants are replete with thousands of proteins and small molecules, many of which are species-specific, poisonous or dangerous. Over time humans have learned to avoid dangerous plants or inactivate many toxic components in food plants, but there is still room for ameliorating food crops (and plants in general) in terms of their allergens and toxins content, especially in their edible parts. Inactivation at the genetic rather than physical or chemical level has many advantages and classical genetic approaches have resulted in significant reduction of toxin content. The capacity, offered by genetic engineering, of turning off (inactivating) specific genes has opened up the possibility of altering the plant content in a far more precise manner than previously available. Different levels of intervention (genes coding for toxins/allergens or for enzymes, transporters or regulators involved in their metabolism) are possible and there are several tools for inactivating genes, both direct (using chemical and physical mutagens, insertion of transposons and other genetic elements) and indirect (antisense RNA, RNA interference, microRNA, eventually leading to gene silencing). Each level/strategy has specific advantages and disadvantages (speed, costs, selectivity, stability, reversibility, frequency of desired genotype and regulatory regime). Paradigmatic examples from classical and transgenic approaches are discussed to emphasize the need to revise the present regulatory process. Reducing the content of natural toxins is a trade-off process: the lesser the content of natural toxins, the higher the susceptibility of a plant to pests and therefore the stronger the need to protect plants. As a consequence, more specific pesticides like Bt are needed to substitute for general pesticides.",

     "abstract": "The first generation of biotechnology products commercialized were crops focusing largely on input agronomic traits whose value was often opaque to consumers. The coming generations of crop plants can be grouped into four broad areas each presenting what, on the surface, may appear as unique challenges and opportunities. The present and future focus is on continuing improvement of agronomic traits such as yield and abiotic stress resistance in addition to the biotic stress tolerance of the present generation; crop plants as biomass feedstocks for biofuels and “bio-synthetics”; value-added output traits such as improved nutrition and food functionality; and plants as production factories for therapeutics and industrial products. From a consumer perspective, the focus on value-added traits, especially improved nutrition, is undoubtedly one of the areas of greatest interest. From a basic nutrition perspective, there is a clear dichotomy in demonstrated need between different regions and socioeconomic groups, the starkest being inappropriate consumption in the developed world and under-nourishment in Less Developed Countries (LDCs). Dramatic increases in the occurrence of obesity and related ailments in affluent regions are in sharp contrast to chronic malnutrition in many LDCs. Both problems require a modified food supply, and the tools of biotechnology have a part to play.

Generation after generation can look forward to new knowledge and technologies, many of which we cannot know at present, and thus there is no reason to be despondent about meeting future goals, if the right decisions and investments are made globally and locally. These decisions include putting optimal use of land at the top of the world agenda to sustain both the planet and an adequate quality of life for mankind. As always has been the case, more investments are urgently required into the dissemination of successful technologies in crop breeding and production, into teaching and training as well as into innovative research. Failure to invest adequately in innovative technologies will leave future decision-makers and citizens with fewer options and greatly enhance the risks for mankind and a healthy planet.",

     "publication date": "11-2010",
     "abstract": "By comparing strategies of genetic alterations introduced in genetic engineering with spontaneously occurring genetic variation, we have come to conclude that both processes depend on several distinct and specific molecular mechanisms. These mechanisms can be attributed, with regard to their evolutionary impact, to three different strategies of genetic variation. These are local nucleotide sequence changes, intragenomic rearrangement of DNA segments and the acquisition of a foreign DNA segment by horizontal gene transfer. Both the strategies followed in genetic engineering and the amounts of DNA sequences thereby involved are identical to, or at least very comparable with, those involved in natural genetic variation. Therefore, conjectural risks of genetic engineering must be of the same order as those for natural biological evolution and for conventional breeding methods. These risks are known to be quite low. There is no scientific reason to assume special long-term risks for GM crops. For future agricultural developments, a road map is designed that can be expected to lead, by a combination of genetic engineering and conventional plant breeding, to crops that can insure food security and eliminate malnutrition and hunger for the entire human population on our planet. Public–private partnerships should be formed with the mission to reach the set goals in the coming decades.",

     "abstract": "The developing world has many unique constraints to crop production and, lacking inputs, they are best overcome if solutions are seed borne. Classical breeding cannot overcome many of these constraints because the species have attained a ‘genetic glass ceiling’, the genes are not available within the species. Transgenics can supply the genes, but typically not as ‘hand me down genes’ from the developed world because of the unique problems: mainly parasitic weeds, and weedy rice, stem borers and post-harvest insects, viral diseases, tropical mycotoxins, anti-feedants, toxic heavy metals and mineral deficiencies. Public sector involvement is imperative for genetically engineering against these constraints, as the private biotechnology sector does not see the developing world as a viable market in most instances. Rice, sorghum, barley, wheat and millets have related weeds, and in certain cases, transgenic gene containment and/or mitigation is necessary to prevent establishment of transgenes in the weedy relatives.",

     "abstract": "The protection of biodiversity and of ecosystem services ought to be a top priority, taken into consideration in the course of all human activities, because we depend on it fully now and for the future. In this context, we note that the ecological problems related to the cultivation of GE crops fail to differ in any fundamental way from the ecological problems associated with agriculture in general, except that they usually involve the application of much lower quantities of chemicals and thus tend to leave the environments in and adjacent to where they are grown in better condition than do the conventional ones. Higher productivity on cultivated lands, which is one outcome of growing GE crops, protects biodiversity by sparing lands not intensively cultivated, whereas relatively non-productive agriculture practised is highly destructive to biodiversity, since it consumes more land in an often destructive way, even though more biodiversity may be preserved among the crops themselves than in industrialized, large fields, especially if hedgerows and woodlands are not encouraged in near proximity. The major preservation of biodiversity, however, does not take place among crops! If weeds are present that are closely related to the crops, they may acquire immunity to the effects from which the crops were protected and be more difficult to control among them. The production of superweeds as a result of hybridization between cultivated crops and their wild relatives is essentially a myth. The definition of ‘organic’ production in the U.S. and elsewhere unjustifiably rules out GE crops, often in such a way as to damage the environment more than would be the case otherwise. Unless the definition of ‘organic’ is a problem, or close relatives to the crops are weedy among them, there seems to be essentially no ecological risk involved in growing GE crops.",

     "abstract": "The major food safety risks are not eating a healthy diet, and failure to avoid foodborne illness. Over one billion people in the world suffer from food insecurity and malnutrition. Nutritionally enhanced transgenic crops such as Golden Rice are one potential strategy for reducing malnutrition in the world. Transgenic crops are subjected to a rigorous pre-market safety assessment. The safety of novel proteins and other products is established, and through compositional analysis and animal studies, the safety of any observed changes is evaluated. These studies provide evidence that the new product is as safe as, or safer than, comparable varieties. It must be asked, however, if this rigorous analysis is necessary, because unregulated crops produced by other breeding methods also undergo genetic changes and contain unintended effects. Golden Rice poses infinitesimally small, if any, risk to consumers whilst it has the potential to spare millions of lives each year. However, because it is a transgenic crop, it cannot be deployed without years of expensive pre-market safety review. Paradoxically, if Golden Rice had been produced by less precise conventional methods of breeding, it would already be in the hands of poor farmers. It is concluded that the hyper-precautionary regulatory process applied to transgenic crops works to the extreme disadvantage of the hungry and the poor.",

     "abstract": "Myths abound when it comes to GE crops. At their worst, myths play an active role in discouraging the use of GE to solve problems that afflict humankind, such as malnutrition and birth defects. Of all the various myths, two have been particularly important in preventing the use of GE maize in its areas of origin. The first is that transgenic maize will contaminate and destroy land races, thus destroying biodiversity and its associated cultural traditions. This myth totally ignores the fact that the gene flow that has taken place between maize and its progenitor, between the land races, and between land races and modern hybrids, has not led to any dire consequences. The second myth is that crops are natural and have not been modified by humans, or if they have, that plant breeding does not alter DNA. This myth ignores the fact that for the most part, it is impossible to alter the appearance of crops without changing the DNA. In fact, DNA movement within the crop genome is normal and its movement leads to double-strand DNA repair, with results like those found around transgene insertion sites. In addition, plants have ways to create novel genes. These changes help plants adapt to evolution and to human selection. The net result is that changes similar to what happens during the production of engineered plants takes place anyway in plant genomes.",

     "abstract": "The potential impacts of genetically modified (GM) crops on income, poverty and nutrition in developing countries continue to be the subject of public controversy. Here, a review of the evidence is given. As an example of a first-generation GM technology, the effects of insect-resistant Bt cotton are analysed. Bt cotton has already been adopted by millions of small-scale farmers, in India, China, and South Africa among others. On average, farmers benefit from insecticide savings, higher effective yields and sizeable income gains. Insights from India suggest that Bt cotton is employment generating and poverty reducing. As an example of a second-generation technology, the likely impacts of beta-carotene-rich Golden Rice are analysed from an ex ante perspective. Vitamin A deficiency is a serious nutritional problem, causing multiple adverse health outcomes. Simulations for India show that Golden Rice could reduce related health problems significantly, preventing up to 40,000 child deaths every year. These examples clearly demonstrate that GM crops can contribute to poverty reduction and food security in developing countries. To realise such social benefits on a larger scale requires more public support for research targeted to the poor, as well as more efficient regulatory and technology delivery systems.",

     "abstract": "Agricultural biotechnologies, and especially transgenic crops, have the potential to boost food security in developing countries by offering higher incomes for farmers and lower priced and better quality food for consumers. That potential is being heavily compromised, however, because the European Union and some other countries have implemented strict regulatory systems to govern their production and consumption of genetically modified (GM) food and feed crops, and to prevent imports of foods and feedstuffs that do not meet these strict standards. This paper analyses empirically the potential economic effects of adopting transgenic crops in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. It does so using a multi-country, multi-product model of the global economy. The results suggest the economic welfare gains from crop biotechnology adoption are potentially very large, and that those benefits are diminished only very slightly by the presence of the European Union's restriction on imports of GM foods. That is, if developing countries retain bans on GM crop production in an attempt to maintain access to EU markets for non-GM products, the loss to their food consumers as well as to farmers in those developing countries is huge relative to the slight loss that could be incurred from not retaining EU market access.",

     "abstract": "The success of the first Green Revolution in the form of abundant food supplies and low prices over the past two decades has diverted the world's attention from agriculture to other pressing issues. This has resulted in lower support for the agricultural research work primarily undertaken by the 15 research centers of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). The total support in real dollars for most of the last three decades has been more or less flat although the number of centers increased from 4 to 15. However, since 2000, the funding situation has improved for the CGIAR centers, with almost all the increase coming from grants earmarked for specific research projects. Even for some centers such as the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), the downward trend continued as late as 2006 with the budget in real dollars reaching the 1978 level of support.The recent food crisis has renewed the call for a second Green Revolution by revitalizing yield growth to feed the world in the face of growing population and a shrinking land base for agricultural use. The slowdown in yield growth because of decades of neglect in agricultural research and infrastructure development has been identified as the underlying reason for the recent food crisis. For the second Green Revolution to be successful, the CGIAR centers will have to play a complex role by expanding productivity in a sustainable manner with fewer resources. Thus, it is crucial to examine the current structure of support for the CGIAR centers and identify the challenges ahead in terms of source and end use of funds for the success of the second Green Revolution. The objective of this paper is to provide a historical perspective on the support to the CGIAR centers and to examine the current status of funding, in particular, the role of project-specific grants in rebuilding capacity of these centers. The paper will also discuss the nature of the support (unrestricted vs. project-specific grants) that will be needed for a much-desired second Green Revolution.",

There is, however, another key problem responsible for the lack of deployment of public good GE-plants: the public sector is incompetent and disinterested for work beyond proof-of-concept, and has neither capability nor funding to develop GE-plant products and introduce them to growers and consumers. The private sector has the expertise for both and in the right circumstances can be ready to support the public sector in public good enterprises.

     "abstract": "The Nuffield Council on Bioethics (NCOB) has published two reports (1999 and 2004) on the social and ethical issues involved in the use of genetically modified crops. This presentation summarises their core ethical arguments. Five sets of ethical concerns have been raised about GM crops: potential harm to human health; potential damage to the environment; negative impact on traditional farming practice; excessive corporate dominance; and the ‘unnaturalness’ of the technology. The NCOB examined these claims in the light of the principle of general human welfare, the maintenance of human rights and the principle of justice. It concluded in relation to the issue of ‘unnaturalness’ that GM modification did not differ to such an extent from conventional breeding that it is in itself morally objectionable. In making an assessment of possible costs, benefits and risks, it was necessary to proceed on a case-by-case basis. However, the potential to bring about significant benefits in developing countries (improved nutrition, enhanced pest resistance, increased yields and new products) meant that there was an ethical obligation to explore these potential benefits responsibly, to contribute to the reduction of poverty, and improve food security and profitable agriculture in developing countries. NCOB held that these conclusions were consistent with any practical precautionary approach. In particular, in applying a precautionary approach the risks associated with the status quo need to be considered, as well as any risks inherent in the technology. These ethical requirements have implications for the governance of the technology, in particular mechanisms for enabling small-scale farmers to express their preferences for traits selected by plant breeders and mechanisms for the diffusion of risk-based evaluations.",

The political willingness to study this new technology and crops as well as the recruitment of sound professionals and scientists to perform the task was crucial. These professionals, with very diverse backgrounds, created the necessary regulatory framework to work with these new crops. Farmers played a decisive role, as adopting this new technology solved some of their agronomic problems, helped them perform more sustainable agronomic practices and provided economic benefits.

Consequently, corn demand increased dramatically and prices tripled. This created a strong positive correlation between petroleum, corn, and food prices resulting in an outcry from U.S. consumers and livestock producers, and food riots in several developing countries.Other factors contributed to higher grain and food prices. Economic growth, especially in Asia, and a weaker U.S. dollar encouraged U.S. grain exports. Investors shifted funds into the commodity's future markets. Higher fuel costs for food processing and transportation put upward pressure on retail food prices.From mid-2008 to mid-2009, petroleum prices fell, the U.S. dollar strengthened, and the world economy entered a serious recession with high unemployment, housing market foreclosures, collapse of the stock market, reduced global trade, and a decline in durable goods and food purchases.

Improvement of farmer welfare and enhanced sustainability of agriculture are universally valued goals. However, means to those ends are politically disputed; that dispute depends on alternative empirical stories about biotechnology, sometimes even alternative epistemologies. Opposition revolves around two fundamental dimensions: bio-safety and bio-property. There is convergence of these dimensions around exceptional risk and vulnerability to corporate control of farmers, but these are analytically separable questions of fact. This paper concentrates on bio-property. Epistemic brokers have successfully established knowledge claims that simultaneously undermine the case for rDNA technologies as potential contributors to development and motivate opposition. Epistemic brokers command authority from their positions at junctures of networks, enabling the screening, weighting, theorizing and diffusion of contentious empirical accounts. In contentions of low information, high information costs and diffuse anxiety, these claims provide cognitive support for opposition to ‘GMOs’. Specifically, claims of patents, monopoly corporate control and terminator technology have diffused to and from India in global networks. Though effective in transnational advocacy networks, these claims have proved either false or inconsistent with dynamics on the ground.",

The current approach to regulation, which captures for case-by-case review organisms to be field tested or commercialized according to the techniques used to construct them rather than their properties, flies in the face of scientific consensus. This approach has been costly in terms of economic losses and human suffering. The poorest of the poor have suffered the most because of hugely inflated development costs of genetically engineered plants and food.A model for regulation of field trials known as the ‘Stanford Model’ is designed to assess risks of new agricultural introductions – whether or not the organisms are genetically engineered, and independent of the genetic modification techniques employed.

The objective of this study is to test whether two expression cassettes inserted into a vector could function efficiently and simultaneously. Taking advantage of the well-known biosynthesis pathway of γ-linolenic acid (GLA), we examined the performance of Y. lipolytica, transformed with two expression cassettes containing previously cloned Δ12-desaturase and Δ6-desaturase genes, by monitoring fatty acid composition of cellular lipids. Our results confirmed that each individual desaturase gene was expressed efficiently by the expression cassette. When two cassettes with respective desaturase genes, carried on the same vector, were integrated into yeast genome, a significant level of GLA was synthesized from endogenous linoleic acid (LA) and oleic acid (OA). Besides, both expression cassettes functioned effectively without influence from each other. These findings indicated that co-expression of two desaturase genes by this dual cassette vector was effective and simultaneous. Results from the present study provide an alternative approach for both the production of several proteins at the same time, and the development of single cell oil containing high-valued polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).",

This promoter could also be used in dicot systems as it was demonstrated to be capable of driving gusA gene expression in tobacco.",

SMMA consisted of 696 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 82.5 kDa. The enzyme was active in acidic conditions (pH 3.5–5.0), with an optimal pH of 5.0, and was extremely thermostable, with a temperature optimum of 100 °C and a melting temperature of 109 °C, both of which extremely favored the starch conversion process. SMMA hydrolyzed linear malto-oligosaccharides, starch, cyclodextrins, and cycloamylose, primarily to maltose and glucose, and showed highest activity toward acarbose and pullulan, hydrolyzed to acarviosine-glucose and panose, respectively. Investigation of the cleavage mode using 14C-maltoheptaose revealed that SMMA preferentially hydrolyzed the first and second glycosidic bonds from the reducing end. To our knowledge, this enzyme is the most thermostable maltogenic amylase yet reported, and might be of potential value in the food and starch industries.",

Synephrine is structurally similar to the active ingredients of several commercial cold remedies. Some Citrus contain high concentrations of synephrine. An enzyme involved in synephrine biosynthesis, tyrosine decarboxylase (TYDC), is a pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that decarboxylates tyrosine to yield CO2 and tyramine. We used PCR to screen, clone and sequence this gene from various synephrine producing and nonproducing Citrus species and varieties to determine if DNA sequence of this gene correlated with synephrine presence.PCR amplification and comparison of DNA sequence indicates DNA sequence differences that may cause production of truncated proteins to be produced in some nonsynephrine producing Citrus.Synephrine production may be genetically determined in part by the gene for TYDC.",

Optimal initial medium pH and incubation temperature were pH 8.0 and 30°C and magnesium ion was essentially required for DHD production.

The bridging point between the two models is the concentration of the monomer unit (i.e. 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA) produced during the central aerobic carbon metabolism. The predictive capabilities of the proposed model are assessed by the comparison of the calculated biopolymer concentration and number average molecular weight with available experimental data obtained from batch and fed-batch cultures of Alcaligenes eutrophus and Alcaligenes latus.

     "abstract": "While many traditional gene therapy strategies attempt to deliver new copies of wild-type genes back to cells harboring the defective genes, RNA-directed strategies offer a range of novel therapeutic applications. Revision or reprogramming of mRNA is a form of gene therapy that modifies mRNA without directly changing the transcriptional regulation or the genomic gene sequence. Group I ribozymes can be engineered to act in trans by recognizing a separate RNA molecule in a sequence-specific manner, and to covalently link a new RNA sequence to this separate RNA molecule. Group I ribozymes have been shown to repair defective transcripts that cause human genetic or malignant diseases, as well as to replace transcript sequences by foreign RNA resulting in new cellular functions. This review provides an overview of current strategies using trans-splicing group I ribozymes in RNA repair and reprogramming.",

They are self-splicing ribozymes that catalyze their own excision and mobile retroelements that can invade new genomic DNA sites. While group II introns typically consist of six structural domains, a number of elements containing an unusual 3′ extension of 53–56 nucleotides have recently been identified. Bioinformatic and functional analyses of these introns have revealed that they belong to two evolutionary subgroups and that the 3′ extension has a differential effect on the splicing reactions for introns of the two subgroups, a functional difference that may be related to structural differences between the introns. In addition, there is phylogenetic evidence that some introns are mobile with their extension. The unusual introns have provided dramatic examples of the structural and functional evolution of group II ribozymes that have been able to accommodate an extra segment into their compact structure while maintaining functionality.",

The analysis of several parasitic plant plastid genomes revealed that coding capacities were reduced to different extent, encompassing genes that regulate plastid gene expression as well as photosynthesis genes. The reorganization of the plastid genome is also reflected in overall increases in point mutation rates that parallel the vanishing of RNA editing sites. Unprecedented in land plants is the parallel loss of the plastid gene coding for an intron maturase and all but one group IIa introns in two parasitic species. These observations highlight the plastome-wide effects that are associated with a relaxed evolutionary pressure in plants living a heterotrophic life style.",

We have used a noncytopathic SFV mutant (ncSFV) RNA vector to generate stable cell lines expressing two human therapeutic proteins: insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1). Therapeutic genes were fused at the carboxy-terminal end of Puromycin N-acetyl-transferase gene by using as a linker the sequence coding for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2A autoprotease. These cassettes were cloned into the ncSFV vector. Recombinant ncSFV vectors allowed rapid and efficient selection of stable BHK cell lines with puromycin. These cells expressed IGF-I and CT-1 in supernatants at levels reaching 1.4 and 8.6 μg/106 cells/24 hours, respectively. Two cell lines generated with each vector were passaged ten times during 30 days, showing constant levels of protein expression. Recombinant proteins expressed at different passages were functional by in vitro signaling assays. Stability at RNA level was unexpectedly high, showing a very low mutation rate in the CT-1 sequence, which did not increase at high passages. CT-1 was efficiently purified from supernatants of ncSFV cell lines, obtaining a yield of approximately 2 mg/L/24 hours.

Five positive clones (P2, P3, P4, P6 and P8) were further assayed for promoter activity in three polyhydroxyalkanoate-producing pseudomonads: Pseudomonas resinovorans, P. corrugata and P. chlororaphis.

Results of an in silico analysis of the P2 sequence further support the assignment of P2 as a bona fide promoter by the localization of putative −10 and −35 promoter regions and a transcription-factor-binding site, rpoD17, in this sequence. We successfully applied promoter P2 to drive the expression in P. chlororaphis of a recombinant α-galactosidase gene of Streptomyces coelicolor, which should be useful for the utilization of oligosaccharides of soy molasses for the production of polyhydroxyalkanoate biopolymer or rhamnolipid biosurfactant.",

Thirty-one isolates of C. gloeosporioides from mango and strawberry grown in Taiwan were examined for their sensitivity to benzimidazole fungicides. The responses of the isolates grown on benzimidazole-amended culture media were characterized as sensitive, moderately resistant, resistant or highly resistant. Analysis of point mutations in the β-tubulin gene by DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments revealed a substitution of GCG for GAG at codon 198 in resistant and highly resistant isolates and a substitution of TAC for TTC at codon 200 in moderately resistant isolates. A set of specific primers, TubGF1 and TubGR, was designed to amplify a portion of the β-tubulin gene for the detection of benzimidazole-resistant C. gloeosporioides. Bsh1236I restriction maps of the amplified β-tubulin gene showed that the resistant isolate sequence, but not the sensitive isolate sequence, was cut.

Km,app. and Vmax,app. were calculated from a Hanes–Woolf plot, and the values were 9.64 mM and 2.45 μM/min mg protein, respectively. Among various metal ions, Cu2+ and Fe2+ severely inhibited carboxylesterase-catalyzed esterification activity (less than 6.0% of relative activity).",

     "abstract": "Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) was immobilized on the macroporous resin by physical adsorption in organic medium. The immobilization was performed in 5 mL isooctane, and the immobilization conditions were optimized. The results were achieved with the mass ratio of lipase to support 1:80, the buffer of pH 6.0, initial addition of PBS 75 μL, and immobilization time of two hours at 30°C. Under the optimal conditions, the activity recovery was 83.3%. IM-CALB presented enhanced pH and thermal stability compared to the free lipase, and showed comparable stability with the commercial Novozym 435, after 7 times repeated use for catalyzing the synthesis of ethyl lactate, 56.9% of its initial activity was retained, and only 24.7% was retained when used for catalyzing the hydrolysis of olive oil.",

     "abstract": "Coupling of biodiesel production and wastewater treatment based on microalgae is a promising approach for handling the energy crisis of declining fossil fuel reserves. A freshwater microalga, Scenedesmus sp. LX1, isolated in a previous study, was tested for its ability to remove nutrients and accumulate lipid while growing in secondary effluent. Compared with 11 other species of high-lipid content microalgae obtained from the algae bank, Scenedesmus sp. LX1 adapted better to secondary effluent and achieved the highest biomass (0.11 g L−1, dry weight) and lipid content (31–33%, dry weight). In secondary effluent, the specific growth rate (r) and maximum population growth rate (Rmax) of Scenedesmus sp. LX1 was 0.2 day−1 and 0.23 × 106 cells (mL day)−1, respectively, and inorganic nutrients could be efficiently removed by over 98% in 10 days. Upon a trigger of nitrogen deficiency on day 10, lipid content increased from 14% to 31%, and the highest lipid accumulation rate during cultivation was 0.008 g (L day)−1.",

     "publication date": "02-2010",
     "abstract": "Novozym 234 was the most frequently used enzyme for production of Rhizoctonia solani protoplasts. Since manufacture of this enzyme was discontinued in the late 1990s, a new procedure was developed by testing lytic enzymes from Sigma and by examining factors affecting protoplast formation. The combination of 20 mg/mL Driselase and 10 mg/mL lysing enzyme was effective in releasing protoplasts from R. solani. The optimal condition for enzyme treatment of mycelium was incubation at 37 °C for 15 min followed by 34 °C for 105 min. The amount of protoplasts produced was positively correlated with growth rate and negatively correlated with mycelial density. Under favorable conditions, R. solani mycelia released 1.68 × 106 protoplasts/mL that is comparable with that produced with Novozym 234. Among various media tested, the best solid medium for protoplast regeneration was 1% V-8 juice agar, while the best liquid medium was 10% potato dextrose broth.",

     "publication date": "02-2010",
     "abstract": "The transgenic plant performance depends on the stable expression of the integrated transgene. In this paper, we have analyzed the stability of the most frequently used constitutive promoter, the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. We used several independent Nicotiana tabacum lines transgenic for the luciferase (LUC) or green fluorescence protein (GFP) coding genes driven by the same 35S promoter. As an indication of the expression level, we measured the steady state RNA level, protein level and protein activity. Exposure of plants to an acute single dose of UVC, UVB or X-ray radiation resulted in a decrease of the transgene expression level, whereas exposure to high temperature increased it. In most of the cases, the expression changed at one to two hours post exposure and returned to normal at four hours. By contrast, plants germinated and grown in the presence of a low dose of either UVB radiation or CuSO4 for two weeks did not show any changes in expression level. We conclude that although the expression level of the transgenes driven by the 35S promoter can be transiently altered by the acute exposure, no substantial changes occur upon constant low exposure.",

     "publication date": "02-2010",
     "abstract": "The industrial importance of Trigonopsis variabilisd-amino acid oxidase (TvDAAO) is represented by its biocatalytic oxidative deamination of cephalosporin C (CPC) to yield glutaryl-7-aminocephalosporanic acid (GL-7-ACA). The process has been incorporated into a two-step bioconversion to produce 7-aminocephalosporanic acid, the crucial synthetic nucleus for several semi-synthetic cephalosporin antibiotics. A homology model of TvDAAO indicated that residue F54 is in a close proximity to the in silico docked CPC. Substitution of this F54 to Tyr (F54Y) resulted in 6-fold improvement in kcat,app and ∼2.5-fold increase in Ki of GL-7-ACA. Heat treatment (55°C, 60 min) did not decrease the activity of F54Y. It is suggested that the Tyr substitution might initiate hydrogen bond formation with the amino group of CPC and facilitate deamination. Faster substrate turnover, reduced GL-7-ACA inhibition and improved thermostability of the F54Y substitution render it a useful candidate in industrial production of semi-synthetic cephems.",

     "abstract": "In this study, oat β-glucan hydrolysate, having average molecular weight of 730,000 g/mol which was previously shown to have great in vitro bile acid binding capacity, was prepared by enzymatic hydrolysis. Furthermore its in vivo hypocholestrolemic effects were evaluated in rats that were fed high-cholesterol diets. Supplements with β-glucan hydrolysate as well as native β-glucan significantly reduced the levels of LDL- and VLDL-cholesterol in serum and further improved the lipid profile in liver. When rats were fed high-cholesterol diets, supplemented with the β-glucan hydrolysate, greater fecal bile acid excretion was observed, which could be favorably correlated to in vitro bile acid binding capacity. In addition, the hydrolysate was more effective at increasing the excretion of fecal cholesterol and triglyceride than the native β-glucan, showing its effectiveness in improving the lipid profile.",

     "abstract": "In this study, optimization of enzymatic synthesis of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), catalyzed by immobilized lipase (Novozym® 435) from Candida antarctica was investigated. Novozym® 435 was used to catalyze caffeic acid and 2-phenylethanol in an isooctane system. Response surface methodology (RSM) and 5-level-4-factor central-composite rotatable design (CCRD) were employed to evaluate the effects of synthesis parameters, such as reaction temperature (30–70°C), reaction time (24–72 hours), substrate molar ratio of caffeic acid to 2-phenylethanol (1:10–1:90) and enzyme amounts (100–500 PLU) on percentage conversion of CAPE by direct esterification. Reaction temperature and time had significant effects on percent conversion. On the basis of ridge max analysis, the optimum conditions for synthesis were: reaction time 59 hours, reaction temperature 69°C, substrate molar ratio 1:72 and enzyme amount 351 PLU. The molar conversion of predicted values and actual experimental values were 91.86 ± 5.35% and 91.65 ± 0.66%, respectively.",
