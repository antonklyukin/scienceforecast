     "abstract": "We pay tribute to Tom Wydrzynski who passed away at age 71 on March 16, 2018, in St. Louis, Missouri, USA. He was a wonderful and caring human being, friend to many, and one of the great plant biologists/biochemists/biophysicists of our time. He successfully dug deeply into the function of the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) by applying a combination of novel biophysical and biochemical techniques to understand how plants produce oxygen from water. He then used this information to venture into artificial photosynthesis, a futuristic goal. In addition, Tom was the first to show that bicarbonate ions have a unique role to play on the electron accepter side of Photosystem II, water-plastoquinone oxido-reductase. This tribute draws heavily from the text that one of us (Govindjee) wrote in 2008 [1] and the unpublished text he read on behalf of many of Tom’s friends on April 7, 2018, at a memorial service in St. Louis in celebration of Tom’s life. This tribute is focused on Tom’s time and work in Urbana, Illinois, but mentions other research as well. It ends with a fitting tribute, a poem written by one of Tom’s contemporaries in Urbana, Ralph Schooley.",

     "publication date": "12-2018",
     "abstract": "Cortaderia selloana is an invasive, gynodioecious species prevalent in Mediterranean area which contains both female and hermaphrodite specimens in the wild population. Using voltammetric data we show that the female and hermaphrodite specimens exhibit differential electrochemical response. Cortaderia selloana leaves from two different provenances in the Valencia Mediterranean area, Sueca and Cullera (Comunitat Valenciana, Spain), in the surroundings of the Albufera Natural Park, a peculiar ecosystem containing unspoilt dune beaches and forests, were studied to determine correlation of flower morphology with the plant's ability to adapt to stress conditions. Our data suggests that gynodioecy may contribute to increasing versatility in the plant under stress by efficiently neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS).",

     "abstract": "Toxic effects of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on photosynthetic processes and biomass were investigated in aquatic plant Lemna gibba, and the plants were exposed to different concentrations of AgNPs for 7 days. At 7 day of exposure, a direct negative impact on the physiological state of plant was indicated by the decrease of chlorophyll (Chl) synthesis, the deterioration of photosynthetic activity and the change in biomass. When L. gibba was treated to 1 mg L−1 of AgNPs, total Chl content and the biomass decreased respectively by 66 and 51% compared to the control (P < 0.05). Under this condition, the alteration of photosystem II (PSII) photochemical reactions was indicated by a significant change compared to control of different studied fluorescence parameters value: FV/FM (35%), ET/RC (63%), VJ (61%), qP (57%) and NPQ (102%). Therefore, Chl a fluorescence measurements showed strong evidence of inhibitory effects on energy transfer from light harvesting complexes to reaction centers, the deterioration of the PSII water splitting system and the inactivation of PSII reaction centers at 1 mg L−1. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that AgNPs induced an inhibitory mechanism on photosynthetic processes and biomass of L. gibba plant.",

     "abstract": "Zinc (Zn) deficiency is one of the causes of anemic disease and mortality in developing countries where rice is the staple food. Such deficiency is enhanced with over polishing of rice grains. Grain Zn contents can be improved through fortification. Agronomic fortification through the use of Wuxal Zn and Antracol (Zn containing fungicide) were tested with BRRI dhan58 and BRRI dhan74 (Zn enriched variety) and compared with no spraying conditions on grain Zn contentin two locations of Bangladesh during 2016-17. Grain yield increased with Zn spraying by about 2–10% for BRRI dhan58 and about 6–18% for BRRI dhan74 compared to control. Grain Zn content in brown rice of BRRI dhan58 under control condition was about 17 mg kg−1 that increased to about 19 mg kg−1 through Zn spraying. Similarly, Zn content of BRRI dhan74 varied from 22.02 to 23.78 mg kg-1 under control condition, which increased to 24.25–25.79 mg kg−1 after Zn spraying. Grain non-parboiled polishing at 9–10% reduced Zn content by about 2.6–5.84 mg kg−1 irrespective of varieties and locations. Zinc enrichment through agronomic practices and awareness buildup on reduced polishing would be the important options for improving rice grain nutritional quality in Bangladesh.",

In all crosses (Doli 5 × GBL1, Doli 5 × KS 331, Pusa Uttam × KS 331, AB-07-02 × GOB 1), fruit length, fruit volume and fruit yield per plant exhibited significantly positive heterobeltiosis which indicates that the hybrid vigor can be utilized on commercial scale for these traits. The higher magnitude of heterobeltiosis for all the morphological traits suggested the presence of over-dominance. In F2 generation, negatively significant estimates of inbreeding depression was observed for plant height and days to first picking in cross Doli 5 × KS 331; fruit per plant, fruit weight and fruit yield per plant in cross Pusa Uttam × KS 331; primary branches per plant, fruit volume and fruit weight in cross Doli 5 × GBL1 and fruit weight in cross (AB-07-02 × GOB 1) indicated the possibilities to get the desired segregants to improve the traits.

     "publication date": "12-2018",
     "abstract": "Diversity has not been exhaustively studied in the Ethiopian garden cress (Lepidium sativum L.). Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine the genetic diversity among garden cress genotypes using microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. One hundred twelve garden cress genotypes collected from diverse growing regions of Ethiopia were investigated using 12 SSR markers which were earlier developed for closely related Lepidium subulatum. A total of 1387 alleles were identified, with the average of 116 alleles per SSR marker. The average polymorphism information content (PIC), Shannon diversity index and Nei’s expected heterozygosity were 0.444, 0.750 and 0.443, respectively. High levels of Shannon diversity were noted within population (0.696) than between populations (0.304). Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) also confirmed that 79% and 21% of total variations were attributed to the within- and between-populations, respectively, indicating greater exchange of gene pool across regions of origin. The genetic distance between populations ranged from 0.044 to 0.396. Cluster analysis using un-weighted neighbor joining method revealed five clusters. The Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) showed the distribution of genotypes in the scatter-plot was highly dispersed at 22% of the total variation, demonstrating complex genetic relationship among genotypes of different geographic origin. Genetic distance matrix among nine populations revealed three different groups to be used as divergent populations in the future breeding programs. Hence, these markers were effective in studying genetic diversity in the Ethiopian garden cress genotypes. Although the transferability of SSR markers from related species was found to be high, the efficiency of identifying more polymorphisms will be improved using garden cress specific markers.",

     "abstract": "Sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) is an economically important herb crop. Its production has been severely threatened by the downy mildew disease caused by the obligate biotrophic oomycete Peronospora belbahrii. Deployment of disease resistant cultivars would be the most cost effective, environmentally friendly control strategy. However, transferring resistance found only in wild Ocimum species to sweet basil via traditional breeding has been extremely challenging. To apply cutting-edge biotechnological approaches to breeding for basil downy mildew resistance, it is essential to better understand the molecular basis of basil-P. belbahrii interactions, for which a set of experimental tools, including a sensitive disease assessment method, are required. Here we described a quantitative PCR (qPCR) approach to quantify P. belbahrri growth during infection. The approach utilizes two pairs of primers that specifically and effectively amplify the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region of P. belbahrii and basil β-tubulin gene for pathogen detection, and normalization of pathogen DNA relative to plant biomass, respectively. This approach was shown to be able to detect increased pathogen growth during infection time course and differentiate disease levels of different sweet basil cultivars at an early infection stage. This qPCR approach is expected to facilitate the dissection of the molecular basis of basil-P. belbahrii interactions and it can also be used for pathogen detection in propagating materials to ensure the growth of disease-free materials and prevent disease spread.",

     "abstract": "Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV), causal agent of the yellow mosaic disease (YMD) in leguminous crops, causes enormous fall in productivity of economically important legumes worldwide. Vigna mungo is severely affected by YMD. In this study, the transcriptional modifications in V. mungo during MYMIV resistance as well as susceptibility were studied and 145 and 109 differentially expressed transcripts were identified in resistant and susceptible plants, respectively through suppression subtractive hybridization. Selected transcripts were validated through RT-qPCR. In incompatible interaction, significant induced expression of genes present in jasmonic acid signalling pathway was observed. Moreover, in incompatible interaction the generation of physical barrier upon virus invasion and maintenance of reactive oxygen species homeostasis was also evidenced. In compatible interaction, the virus succeeded to manipulate the host machinery resulting in significant decrease in defense related gene expression leading to manifestation of disease symptoms. We have generated two hypothetical models of incompatible and compatible interactions based on the possible biological and molecular function of differentially expressed transcripts obtained from resistant and susceptible plants following MYMIV infection. Knowledge gained from these models will help in deciphering the mechanism of MYMIV resistance not only in V. mungo but also in other plant-pathogen interaction study.",

     "abstract": "Plant parasitic nematodes (PPN) are microscopic roundworms that mostly develop an obligate parasitic relationship with hosts. Once PPN reach root surfaces, they slowly insert a stylet, needle-like structure, into and feed cytosolic nutrients from roots, which cause cell and tissue mortality (Fosu-Nyarko and Jones, 2016; Mitchum et al., 2013). Recently, these PPN-associated damages have become of great agricultural and economic importance resulting in an estimated annual loss of ∼14 percent of world crop production (Nicol et al., 2011). Thus, an urgent breakthrough is needed in developing effective and sustainable pest management programs such as new resistance cultivars. It is however not necessarily forthcoming, largely due to our little knowledge of the defense physiology of plants against PPN. Hence, this review will briefly revisit current working models of plant and PPN interactions with a focus of plant defense responses, and pinpoint information gaps within, which help revamp unique and alternative prospective for the future studies.",

Therefore, the efficacy of Glomus clarum and G. deserticola as biocontrol agents against Fusarium verticillioides (AKR 05, ILR 06 and ERW 05) strains on maize T2L COMP.4 was investigated. Concentration 10 g (20 spores), 20 g (48 spores) and 30 g (72 spores) of Glomus clarum and G. deserticola were inoculated separately into 8 kg of soil at four weeks after planting (WAP), with a control (0 g). In addition, spore suspension (1.0 × 106 spores/mL) of Fusarium verticillioides was inoculated at 8 WAP. The treatments were arranged in a completely randomized design with three replicates. The pathogenic effects of F. verticillioides on plant height and shoot weight were significantly reduced by the application of 20 g of G. clarum and 30 g of G. deserticola. Also, 10 g of both G. clarum and G. deserticola significantly enhanced the production of the husk cover, while 30 g G. clarum and G. deserticola significantly reduced the severity of maize ear rot. Therefore, 30 g G. clarum and G. deserticola had biocontrol potential against Fusarium verticillioides.

The present study was carried out to assess disease incidence and severity of associated fungal diseases of Mango ginger; assess rhizome yield loss due to disease; isolate and identify fungal pathogens associated; evaluate growth parameters of Mango ginger. Mango ginger plants began showing symptoms of leaf spot and leaf blight at first week and at fifth week after emergence, respectively; at twenty-fourth week some rhizomes were visually observed to be affected with rot.

     "publication date": "09-2018",
     "abstract": "Being a pathway tightly linked to photosynthesis, photorespiration is regulated by light, but also by both nutrients and metabolites on transcriptional level. However, only little is known about the signals and how they are integrated on promoter level to coordinate the whole pathway. Using a bioinformatic approach we analyzed the co-expression patterns of photorespiratory genes, the predicted cis-regulatory elements in their 5′ upstream regions and the existence of introns in their 5′UTRs. We found that there are groups of photorespiratory genes that are strongly co-expressed among each other. The analysis showed a high co-expression between photorespiration and ammonia re-fixation. However, a strong co-regulation between two genes, like GDCH1 and GDCH2, did not necessarily mean that these genes share common cis-element in their 5′ upstream regions. TATA-box, MYB1AT, and MYB4 binding site motifs occurred in 16 out of 20 genes. Furthermore, photorespiratory genes are subjected to alternative splicing. We discuss the presence of cis-elements in the context of both stress responses and development. A genome wide analysis of Arabidopsis 5′UTRs revealed that 5′UTRs introns are overrepresented in photorespiratory genes. Promoter:gusA studies indicated that photorespiratory gene expression is also regulated by intron-mediated enhancement (IME). As already shown for glutamate: glyoxylate aminotransferase, transcript abundance of serine: glyoxylate aminotransferase was affected by IME on mRNA level. IME of gene expression of glycolate oxidase was shown to act on translational level.",

To elucidate the underlying mechanisms in response to drought stress, we performed transcriptomic and proteomic profiling analyses under mild and severe drought conditions. After de novo assembly, 92,752 unigenes were obtained with an average size of 791 bp and N50 of 1303 bp. 70,732 (76.26%) unigenes showed high sequence similarity with genes in the Nr database. Among the differentially expressed genes, 446 and 418 genes were up- and down-regulated under drought stress, respectively. Using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation technology, we identified 4105 unique proteins. Among them, 255 and 280 proteins were up- and down-regulated, respectively. We selected top 45 genes and proteins that are abundantly expressed yet significantly up- or down-regulated under drought stress. Among the up-regulated genes and proteins, storage proteins and dehydrins dominated the list. Cell wall structural proteins, amylase, and trypsin inhibitors were also up-regulated by drought stress. Chloroplast function-related proteins accounted for the majority of the significantly down-regulated proteins. Pathway analysis indicated that galactose hydrolysis, proline biosynthesis, pentose phosphate pathway and antioxidant systems were significantly up-regulated, whereas pathways of chlorophyll biosynthesis, aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, flavonoid and isoflavonoid biosynthesis were all down-regulated.

     "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding endogenous riboregulators that play significant roles in plant growth, development, metabolism, defense, and stress responses. Upland cotton is best known for its economic value as natural fiber and oil. It is also an important model for genome evolution, polyploidy effects, cell growth, and cell wall biosynthesis. The polyploid species, Gossypium hirsutum L. (2n = 52), evolved from two progenitors (2n = 26), one contributing an ancestral genome similar to A genomes of G. herbaceum and G. arboreum, and the other like the D genome of G. raimondii. There is much to be learned about Gossypium miRNAs and their gene targets, about the effects of polyploidy and their practical ramifications. In this study, small-RNA (sRNA) libraries from four Gossypium species and three tissue libraries (seed, seedling, and leaf) from G. hirsutum were constructed and analyzed using high-throughput sequencing with Illumina/MiSeq then computational prediction by MIREAP. Results showed 245 known miRNAs belonging to 67 miRNA families and 149 novel (non-redundant and redundant) miRNAs derived from 394 genomic loci. This unified study identified 21 and 33 conserved miRNA families across four Gossypium species and three tissue libraries, respectively. Similar to canonical miRNAs, the 5′ of novel miRNAs had the higher preference for U and A residues. In this study, 551 potential target genes were predicted in 45 conserved miRNA families, while 439 targets were associated with 113 novel miRNAs. The majority of the conserved (34%) and novel (22%) miRNA targets identified belonged to cellular processes and signaling. However, the functional diversity of novel miRNA targets is attributed to the tissue and species bias. Most of the identified targets were regulated by mRNA cleavage than by translational repression. These results provide a basis for better understanding regulatory networks in upland cotton (G. hirsutum) and its closest progenitors.",

     "abstract": "Bangladesh lies within the origin of rice biodiversity and is home to many genotypes with varying amylose content and grain size. There is however no precise data on their amylose content and correlation with grain size and type. Yet these classifications governs the taste, cooking and nutritional quality of rice, ultimately determining its consumer preference and market price. Correlating grain size with amylose content will be useful information for Diabetics, particularly due to the unproven assumption that long grains correlate with high amylose content and vice versa. In this study, 131 long, medium and short grain Bangladeshi rice cultivars were analyzed and classified into high, intermediate, low or very low (H, I, L or VL) amylose slender or bold grain types. Both short and medium grain cultivars have mostly H or I amylose. The maximum amount of L and VL amylose was found among the long grain cultivars which also contain H and I amylose-containing rice. Therefore we could clearly show that long grains are associated with L and VL amylose, rather than medium and short grain. The microsatellite marker (RM190) and CAPS marker (RM190F-GBSSW2R/AccI) are linked to the gene responsible for amylose content and can be used for distinguishing variants. Thirty-five cultivars with all grain sizes were found to have four RM190 alleles (1–4: 100, 110, 116 and 120bp). Cultivars having VL amylose were identified by RM190F-GBSSW2R/AccI cleavage pattern. High amylose-containing rice was found mostly associated with class 1 and 2 alleles. The intermediate amylose group was characterized by the absence of the class 1 allele. Therefore we could distinguish VL, H and I amylose rice with simple tests with the rest belonging to the L group. The study thus demonstrated the use of simple tests in the categorization of rice, based on amylose groups.",

The simplest aspect of this is to link morphological and anatomical images of structures for PO terms with genes involved in the development of those structures (GO terms). This, also, would include images of expression analyses by in situ hybridization. By using a process of reciprocal illumination, we will be able to clarify and/or redefine PO terms. In particular, an example of this is the integument development during ovule maturation in seed plants. Gymnosperms have one integument; whereas, Angiosperms (flowering plants) have two integuments, i.e., an inner integument surrounded by an outer integument. The question that arises is which of the two integuments in the Angiosperms is the equivalent of the single integument in the gymnosperms? In Angiosperms, the gene INNER NO OUTER (INO) is involved in the proper development of the outer integument but not in the inner integument and in ino mutants there is no outer integument. INO genes are angiosperm specific as no orthologs have been found in gymnosperms. Thus, it appears that the inner integument of the Angiosperms is equivalent –homologous- to the single integument of the gymnosperms and the PO terms can be revised accordingly.",

Effect on the peltate glandular trichome density and diameter was also studied. Out of the different concentrations of TiO2 NPs (0, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 mg L−1) tested on the plant, 150 mg L−1 proved optimum for most of the parameters, if however, 100 and 150 mg L−1 were equally significant in some cases. A maximum increase of 17.7% and 19.1% was reported in the nitrate reductase and carbonic anhydrase activities respectively by 150 mg L−1 at 150 days after planting (DAP) compared to untreated plant. Chlorophyll fluorescence and net photosynthetic rate exhibited a maximum enrichment of 7.2% and 23.8% respectively by 150 mg L−1 over control. Furthermore, EO content and yield of the plant were also significantly enhanced by 39.4% and 105.1% respectively over control.

The effect of SA (1 mM) and sodium chloride (0, 100, and 200 mM NaCl) on some biochemical and molecular responses of safflower plants was studied. Plants were harvested randomly at 21 days after the start of treatments. Results revealed that chlorophyll and total soluble protein contents decreased under salinity, however proline, glycine betaine, carbohydrate, total carotenoids, flavonoid, and anthocyanin contents, as well as PAL gene expression increased. The exogenous SA improved the response of safflower to salinity by increasing glycine betaine, total soluble protein, carbohydrates, chlorophylls, carotenoids, flavonoid, and anthocyanin contents. In addition, qRT-PCR analysis showed that exogenous SA induced expression of PAL gene in both salt-treated and untreated plants. Moreover, SA application under saline conditions decreased the levels of proline which could indicate successful acclimatization of these plants to saline conditions. Our data suggested that the exogenous SA played a key role in stress condition through regulation of osmotic adjustment and antioxidant system due to some compounds. These results provide novel insights about the physiological and molecular role of SA in salt resistance. Therefore, this component can be considered due to low price and availability.",

Cell suspension cultures offer an attractive alternative to carry out this kind of studies in a simplified biological system. Nevertheless, the cell suspensions exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity concerning cell cycle distribution; therefore, synchronization methods must be previously established for this plant species. In the present research, cell suspensions of J. curcas were used to assess phosphorus, nitrogen or sucrose starvation as cell cycle synchronization approaches. Cell suspension cultures were established from the endosperm of seeds using a method for the enzymatic breakdown, without a previous callogenesis stage. The cell suspensions reached a maximum growth rate of 0.15 d−1 and a doubling time of 4.8 d. Microscopy analyses showed amyloplasts in some of the cells; however, oil and protein bodies were not observed. Regarding cell cycle synchronization, the results indicated that phosphorus or nitrogen starvation did not affect the cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. However, the sucrose depletion for three days induced an accumulation of 67% of the cells in the G0/G1 phase. This effect was reversed with the addition of a carbon source. Moreover, these culture conditions generated a population of cells (approx. 5%) with a higher DNA content (3n > 6n), which was interpreted as the activation of an endoreplication process. Our findings suggest that nutrient starvation can affect in a differential way the cell synchronization process.",

Aerobic rice is considered to be promising for rice production under water constrained environments where it can be grown under non-flooded and unsaturated soil. All practices for aerobic rice cultivation must start by first identifying promising rice varieties that are expected to produce higher grain yield under such conditions. Therefore, we conducted a field experiment with an experimental design of split-plot in the Tarai region of the Western Himalayas, India, in two irrigation regimes i.e., of continuous flooding and of aerobic condition, using four high-yielding rice genotypes: DRRH-2, PA6444, KRH-2 and Jaya. A grain yield of 743 to 910 g/m2 was obtained on a typical freely draining soil i.e., under aerobic conditions. Further, DRRH-2 showed enhanced panicle number, spikelet number, filled grain number under aerobic conditions, resulting in the higher grain yield of 910 g m/m2. We conclude from our studies that the higher productivity of rice depends upon the improved sink capacity (grain number x grain weight) of the genotype, and that this acts as a major factor limiting yield potential under aerobic and flooded conditions.",

Understanding molecular mechanisms of plant abiotic stress tolerance is important for developing stress tolerant crop plants for sustaining crop productivity in future. Chrysopogon zizanioides (vetiver) is a perennial C4 grass reported to be tolerant to water, salinity and submergence stress. Here, we subjected C. zizanioides seedlings to salt and drought stress and carried out whole transcriptome profiling of leaf and root tissues. Assessing the global transcriptome changes under drought and salt stress resulted in the identification of several genes contributing to stress response in this species. Overall, more transcriptomic changes were observed in leaf tissue compared to root tissue. The response to either stress manifested primarily as upregulation of gene expression in both leaf and root. The study identified stress responsive genes commonly and differently regulated under stress/tissue conditions. Several DEGs in our data were identified as enzymes involved in biosynthesis of essential oil components. The differential expression of these genes under drought and salt stress may affect the vetiver essential oil composition under these stresses. Similarly, several genes involved in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids including morphin were found to be differentially expressing in our data. Our data may facilitate further molecular studies on stress tolerance of C. zizanioides. The DEGs from our results are potential candidates for understanding and engineering abiotic stress tolerance in plants.",

Here we present a simple method that changes the dimension of comparison by treating genes as variable traits to directly assess significance of differences in expression levels among pre-defined gene groups. Because expression distributions are typically skewed (thus unfit for direct assessment using Gaussian statistical methods) our method involves transforming expression data to approximate a normal distribution followed by dividing the genes into groups, then applying Gaussian parametric methods to assess significance of observed differences. This method enables the assessment of differences in gene expression distributions within and across samples, enabling hypothesis-based comparison among groups of genes. We demonstrate this method by assessing the significance of specific gene groups’ differential response to heat stress conditions in maize.",

Over the years, this crop has been gaining recognition as an ornamental and landscaping plant. However, no study was done on the characteristics of inflorescence during the flowering stage. Therefore, the present study was aimed to elucidate cell wall metabolism in bracts in relation to inflorescence opening and peduncle strength throughout the inflorescence development. The inflorescences at four developmental stages i.e. tight bud, six reflexing tip, all involucral bracts unfolded and full bloom were used in this study. Results indicate that cellulose and pectin content in involucral bracts were hydrolyzed by cellulase and pectin methylesterase during the inflorescence development from tight bud to full bloom stage. The hydrolyzed bract cell walls reduce water potential in cells and enable water inflow for cell expansion. Subsequently, the inflorescence bracts unfolded. The analysis of cell wall composition and anatomical studies on peduncle parts reveals that at tight bud stage, the peduncle strength depends on the turgidity of the cells as evidenced by the presence of higher mucilage content. As the inflorescence developmental stage progressed, the mucilage content decreased gradually. The peduncle was strengthened by cell wall thickening via cellulose deposition and vascular bundles lignification for mechanical support. Besides, the lignified vascular bundle is the key factor in increasing the transportation efficiency of stored carbohydrates and water from the mother plant for inflorescence development.",

     "abstract": "Duplications are one on the main evolutionary forces in angiosperm, especially in Poaceae. A large number of genes involved in various metabolisms and pathways originate from such duplications (whole genome, segmental or single gene). However, to detect such duplication may be complicated, costly and generally requires heavy human and material investments. Here, we propose an alternative approach for detecting putative recent segmental duplications in haploid or diploid homozygous organisms based on NGS data. We rely on abusive mappings of paralogous sequences that increase apparent heterozygous points at a given locus to identify such duplicated genomic regions. We test our tool on simulated data, then on true rice genomic sequences and were able to identify about 200 candidate duplicated genes in African rice (Oryza glaberrima) lineage compared to Asian one (O. sativa).",

It is imperative to have a comparative resolution of AS to understand the pre-mRNAs splicing diversity. In the present research, we present a comparative assessment of the AS events in four different fruit plants including apple (Malus domestica), grape (Vitis vinifera), sweet orange (Citrus sinensis), and woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca), using spliced mapping of the expressed sequence tags and mRNA sequences. We identified a total of 2039 AS events in apple, 2454 in grape, 1425 in orange, and 631 in strawberry, respectively. In this study grape displayed the maximum number of genes (1588) associated with the splicing, followed by apple (1580), orange (1133) and strawberry (444). Transcripts mapping analysis shows that grape plant has relatively larger intron sizes than introns in other fruit species. The data provide a basis for further functional characterization of the genes undergoing AS and can be accessed at Plant Alternative Splicing Database (http://proteomics.ysu.edu/altsplice/plant/).",

The Phosphate Transporter 1 gene family (Pht1) has crucial role in several metabolic processes from plants and has been identified in different crops. Here, the CDS sequence of 28 Pht1 genes described for Oryza sativa, Zea mays and Arabidopsis thaliana were used to identify nine homologous sequences in Sorghum bicolor and Setaria italica and the S. bicolor sequences were used as reference to guide the identification of those homologous sequences in Saccharum spp. Using five different libraries of paired-end Illumina reads, nine sugarcane genes (ScPht1) were assembled and the rate of gene recover, the average of gene length, the sequencing depth and the GC content were estimated in 93.72%, 2053 bp, 16.08X and 58.70%, respectively. Putative SNPs and microsatellites loci were found for those ScPht1 genes and three of them seem to be under positive selection pressure. A phylogenetic tree corroborates with orthology relationship among Saccharum spp., O. sativa and Z. mays genes, emphasizing the levels of synteny described for grass species. This study discuss the potential use of homology in genomic studies as one of the most useful tools for gene discovery and annotation, illustrating how useful is the exploitation of public databases for gene identification and characterization, allowing further gene manipulation in crop improvements.",

As efforts to characterize genes associated with fruit and vegetable quality increase, the strawberry fruit has emerged as a useful tool to study the effects of transient gene expression. Introduction of active Agrobacterium cultures bearing loss- or gain-of-function constructs into developing fruits can provide robust gene silencing or modest overexpression within days of treatment. Fruits can then be assessed for transgene effects on endogenous gene expression, metabolism, physiology or development. The approach also allows introduction of VIGS-mediated silencing constructs as well as the assessment of promoter activity in fruits.

Based on our previous research, a total of ten endophyte strains were selected as a consortium to investigate the effects of inoculation on commercial hardwood cuttings of Populus deltoides × P. nigra clone OP-367. After one and a half months of growth under non-stress conditions followed by one month under water stress, there was substantial growth promotion with improved leaf physiology of poplar plants in response to the endophyte inoculation. Furthermore, inoculated plants demonstrated reduced damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) indicating a possible mechanism for symbiosis-mediated drought tolerance. Production of important phytohormones by these endophytes and identification of microbial genes involved in conferring drought tolerance suggests their potential roles in the modulation of the plant host stress response.",

SABP2, a methyl salicylate esterase is a critical component of SA-signaling pathway in tobacco plants. The transgenic tobacco SABP2-silenced lines treated with tetraFA, a known inhibitor of esterase activity of SABP2 exhibited enhanced susceptibility to nonhost pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola compared to the control plants. The increased accumulation of SABP2 transcripts upon Psp infection supports the involvement of SABP2 in nonhost resistance. The tetra-FA treated plants also showed delayed expression of pathogenesis related-1 gene upon Psp inoculations. The expression of nonhost marker genes CDM1 and HIN1 was also monitored in tobacco plants infected with host-pathogen P.s. pv. tabaci and P.s. pv. phaseolicola. Overall, results presented in this manuscript suggest that SABP2 has a role in nonhost resistance in tobacco plants.",

     "abstract": "Plant pathogenic viruses cause a number of economically important diseases in food, fuel, and fiber crops worldwide. As obligate parasites with highly reduced genomes, viruses rely heavily on their hosts for replication, assembly, intra- and intercellular movement, and attraction of vectors for dispersal. Therefore, viruses must influence or directly utilize many host proteins and processes. While many general effects of virus infection have long been known (e.g., reduction in photosynthesis, alterations in carbon metabolism and partitioning, increased expression of pathogenesis-related proteins), the precise underlying mechanisms and functions in the viral life cycle are largely a mystery. Proteomic studies, including studies of differential protein regulation during infection as well as studies of host–viral protein–protein interactions, can help shed light on the complex and varied molecular interactions between viruses and plant hosts. In this review, we summarize current literature in plant-virus proteomics and speculate on why viruses have been selected to manipulate these diverse biochemical pathways in their plant hosts.",

     "abstract": "Plants lack 7-transmembrane, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) because the G alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein complex is “self-activating”—meaning that it spontaneously exchanges bound GDP for GTP without the need of a GPCR. In lieu of GPCRs, most plants have a seven transmembrane receptor-like regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) protein, a component of the complex that keeps G-protein signaling in its non-activated state. The addition of glucose physically uncouples AtRGS1 from the complex through specific endocytosis leaving the activated G protein at the plasma membrane. The complement of proteins in the AtRGS1/G-protein complex over time from glucose-induced endocytosis was profiled by immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry (IP-MS). A total of 119 proteins in the AtRGS1 complex were identified. Several known interactors of the complex were identified, thus validating the approach, but the vast majority (93/119) were not known previously. AtRGS1 protein interactions were dynamically modulated by d-glucose. At low glucose levels, the AtRGS1 complex is comprised of proteins involved in transport, stress and metabolism. After glucose application, the AtRGS1 complex rapidly sheds many of these proteins and recruits other proteins involved in vesicular trafficking and signal transduction. The profile of the AtRGS1 components answers several questions about the type of coat protein and vesicular trafficking GTPases used in AtRGS1 endocytosis and the function of endocytic AtRGS1.",

     "abstract": "In plants, the sucrose non-fermenting (SNF1)-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) represents a central integrator of low energy signaling and acclimation towards many environmental stress responses. Although SnRK1 acts as a convergent point for many different environmental and metabolic signals to control growth and development, it is currently unknown how these many different signals could be translated into a cell-type or stimulus specific response since many components of SnRK1-regulated signaling pathways remain unidentified. Recently, we have demonstrated that proteins containing a domain of unknown function (DUF) 581 interact with the catalytic α subunits of SnRK1 (AKIN10/11) from Arabidopsis thaliana and could potentially act as mediators conferring tissue- and stimulus-type specific differences in SnRK1 regulation. To further extend the SnRK1 signaling network in plants, we systematically screened for novel DUF581 interaction partners using the yeast two-hybrid system. A deep and exhaustive screening identified 17 interacting partners for 10 of the DUF581 proteins tested. Many of these novel interaction partners are implicated in cellular processes previously associated with SnRK1 signaling. Furthermore, we mined publicly available interaction data to identify additional DUF581 interacting proteins. A protein–protein interaction network resulting from our studies suggests connections between SnRK1 signaling and other central signaling pathways involved in growth regulation and environmental responses. These include TOR and MAP-kinase signaling as well as hormonal pathways. The resulting protein–protein interaction network promises to be effective in generating hypotheses to study the precise mechanisms SnRK1 signaling on a functional level.",

Plant breeders played an important role mainly by introgression of a trait of interest, through the transfer of genetic loci, into an elite crop line that exhibits high-yield performance across a wide range of conditions. Modern agriculture has relied on the use of biotechnologies and molecular biology to improve marker development and aid in the discovery of candidate loci or genes associated with desirable traits, thereby reducing the time required for selective breeding.In this review, we briefly describe the evolution of the methods used to identify candidate leads (gene, loci or regulatory regions) for crop improvement, starting by quantitative genetic methods. The development of co-expression and molecular networks will be described. It will be shown how network analysis can reinforced the discovery of candidate genes/loci more rapidly and with higher confidence. These improvements will serve to accelerate genetic engineering and molecular breeding as modern agriculture confronts the challenging times ahead, with the increase of abiotic stresses for crops as drought, heat, soil high salinity or waterlogging.Without taking in account possible losses due these growing stresses, the increase in crop yields needs to be significantly accelerated to feed the growing world population, following the FAO previsions.",

Relations were then annotated from the literature, defining the relevant terms according to standard biomedical ontologies. This curation process was supported by a dedicated graphical user interface, called Leaf Knowtator. A total of 283 primary research articles were curated by a community of annotators, yielding 9947 relations monitored for consistency and over 12,500 references to Arabidopsis genes. This information was converted into a relational database (KnownLeaf) and merged with other public Arabidopsis resources relative to transcriptional networks, protein–protein interaction, gene co-expression, and additional molecular annotations. Within KnownLeaf, leaf phenotype data can be searched together with molecular data originating either from this curation initiative or from external public resources. Finally, we built a network (LeafNet) with a portion of the KnownLeaf database content to graphically represent the leaf phenotype relations in a molecular context, offering an intuitive starting point for knowledge mining.

     "abstract": "Anhydrobiosis is an adaptive strategy of certain organisms or specialised propagules to survive in the absence of water while programmed cell death (PCD) is a finely tuned cellular process of the selective elimination of targeted cell during developmental programme and perturbed biotic and abiotic conditions. Particularly during water stress both the strategies serve single purpose i.e., survival indicating PCD may also function as an adaptive process under certain conditions. During stress conditions PCD cause targeted cells death in order to keep the homeostatic balance required for the organism survival, whereas anhydrobiosis suspends cellular metabolic functions mimicking a state similar to death until reestablishment of the favourable conditions. Anhydrobiosis is commonly observed among organisms that have ability to revive their metabolism on rehydration after removal of all or almost all cellular water without damage. This feature is widely represented in terrestrial cyanobacteria and bryophytes where it is very common in both vegetative and reproductive stages of life-cycle. In the course of evolution, with the development of advanced vascular system in higher plants, anhydrobiosis was gradually lost from the vegetative phase of life-cycle. Though it is retained in resurrection plants that primarily belong to thallophytes and a small group of vascular angiosperm, it can be mostly found restricted in orthodox seeds of higher plants. On the contrary, PCD is a common process in all eukaryotes from unicellular to multicellular organisms including higher plants and mammals.

     "abstract": "Plants adapt to the prevailing photoperiod by adjusting growth and flowering to the availability of energy. To understand the molecular changes involved in adaptation to a long-day condition we comprehensively profiled leaf six at the end of the day and the end of the night at four developmental stages on Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown in a 16 h photoperiod, and compared the profiles to those from leaf 6 of plants grown in a 8 h photoperiod. When Arabidopsis is grown in a long-day photoperiod individual leaf growth is accelerated but whole plant leaf area is decreased because total number of rosette leaves is restricted by the rapid transition to flowering. Carbohydrate measurements in long- and short-day photoperiods revealed that a long photoperiod decreases the extent of diurnal turnover of carbon reserves at all leaf stages. At the transcript level we found that the long-day condition has significantly reduced diurnal transcript level changes than in short-day condition, and that some transcripts shift their diurnal expression pattern. Functional categorisation of the transcripts with significantly different levels in short and long day conditions revealed photoperiod-dependent differences in RNA processing and light and hormone signalling, increased abundance of transcripts for biotic stress response and flavonoid metabolism in long photoperiods, and for photosynthesis and sugar transport in short photoperiods. Furthermore, we found transcript level changes consistent with an early release of flowering repression in the long-day condition. Differences in protein levels between long and short photoperiods mainly reflect an adjustment to the faster growth in long photoperiods. In summary, the observed differences in the molecular profiles of leaf six grown in long- and short-day photoperiods reveal changes in the regulation of metabolism that allow plants to adjust their metabolism to the available light. The data also suggest that energy management is in the two photoperiods fundamentally different as a consequence of photoperiod-dependent energy constraints.",

     "abstract": "C4 photosynthesis is a trait that has evolved in 66 independent plant lineages and increases the efficiency of carbon fixation. The shift from C3 to C4 photosynthesis requires substantial changes to genes and gene functions effecting phenotypic, physiological and enzymatic changes. We investigate the role of ancient whole genome duplications (WGD) as a source of new genes in the development of this trait and compare expression between paralog copies. We compare Gynandropsis gynandra, the closest relative of Arabidopsis that uses C4 photosynthesis, with its C3 relative Tarenaya hassleriana that underwent a WGD named Th-α. We establish through comparison of paralog synonymous substitution rate that both species share this paleohexaploidy. Homologous clusters of photosynthetic gene families show that gene copy numbers are similar to what would be expected given their duplication history and that no significant difference between the C3 and C4 species exists in terms of gene copy number. This is further confirmed by syntenic analysis of T. hassleriana, Arabidopsis thaliana and Aethionema arabicum, where syntenic region copy number ratios lie close to what could be theoretically expected. Expression levels of C4 photosynthesis orthologs show that regulation of transcript abundance in T. hassleriana is much less strictly controlled than in G. gynandra, where orthologs have extremely similar expression patterns in different organs, seedlings and seeds. We conclude that the Th-α and older paleopolyploidy events have had a significant influence on the specific genetic makeup of Cleomaceae versus Brassicaceae. Because the copy number of various essential genes involved in C4 photosynthesis is not significantly influenced by polyploidy combined with the fact that transcript abundance in G. gynandra is more strictly controlled, we also conclude that recruitment of existing genes through regulatory changes is more likely to have played a role in the shift to C4 than the neofunctionalization of duplicated genes.DATA: The data deposited at NCBI represents raw RNA reads for each data series mentioned: 5 leaf stages, root, stem, stamen, petal, carpel, sepal, 3 seedling stages and 3 seed stages of Tarenaya hassleriana and Gynandropsis gynandra.

     "abstract": "Plant speciation and diversification strongly rely on structural changes in the nuclear genome, both at the whole ploidy and individual chromosome level. Phylogenetic, comparative mapping and cytological studies have provided insights into the evolutionary mechanisms that shape the plant genome. These include major genome alterations, such as whole genome duplication and hybridization (auto- and allopolyploidy), but also comprise the concomitant or independent occurrence of minor chromosome changes, such as aneuploidization and dysploidy (inversions and translocations). Despite the relevance of chromosomal instability as a driver for genome evolution and adaptation, little is yet known about the cellular mechanisms and processes that actually underlie these modifications. Here, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of somatic and meiotic defects that lead to polyploidy or structural genome changes and discuss their relevance for plant genome evolution and speciation. In addition, we elaborate on the existence of stress-induced changes in chromosome and ploidy integrity in plants and their putative role in boosting adaptive genome evolution in hostile environments.",

     "abstract": "Retrotransposons are major components of higher plant genomes, and long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons are especially predominant. Thus, numerous LTR retrotransposon families with high copy numbers exist in most plant genomes. As the integrated copies of these retrotransposons are genetically inherited, their insertion polymorphisms among crop cultivars have been used as functional molecular markers such as inter-retrotransposon amplification polymorphism (IRAP), retrotransposon microsatellite amplification polymorphism (REMAP), retrotransposon-based insertion polymorphism (RBIP) and sequence-specific amplification polymorphism (S-SAP). However, the effective use of these methods requires suitable LTR sequences showing high insertion polymorphism among crop cultivars. Recently, we conducted an efficient screening of LTR retrotransposon families that showed high insertion polymorphism among closely related strawberry cultivars using a next-generation sequencing platform. This method focuses on the primer binding site (PBS), which is adjacent to the 5′ LTR sequence and is conserved among different LTR retrotransposon families. Construction of a sequencing library using the PBS motif allowed us to identify a large number of LTR sequences and their insertion sites throughout the genome. The LTR sequences identified by our method showed high insertion polymorphism among closely related strawberry cultivars, and these families should thus be useful in the development of molecular markers for phylogenetic and genetic diversity studies. This article briefly describes the general aspects of retrotransposon-based molecular markers and also outlines our method for screening LTR sequences suitable for genetic analyses.(http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/).",

     "abstract": "Numerous comparative genome analyses have revealed the wide extent of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in living organisms, which contributes to their evolution and genetic diversity. Viruses play important roles in HGT. Endogenous viral elements (EVEs) are defined as viral DNA sequences present within the genomes of non-viral organisms. In eukaryotic cells, the majority of EVEs are derived from RNA viruses using reverse transcription. In contrast, endogenous non-retroviral elements (ENREs) are poorly studied. However, the increasing availability of genomic data and the rapid development of bioinformatics tools have enabled the identification of several ENREs in various eukaryotic organisms. To date, a small number of ENREs integrated into plant genomes have been identified. Of the known non-retroviruses, most identified ENREs are derived from double-strand (ds) RNA viruses, followed by single-strand (ss) DNA and ssRNA viruses. At least eight virus families have been identified. Of these, viruses in the family Partitiviridae are dominant, followed by viruses of the families Chrysoviridae and Geminiviridae. The identified ENREs have been primarily identified in eudicots, followed by monocots. In this review, we briefly discuss the current view on non-retroviral sequences integrated into plant genomes that are associated with plant-virus evolution and their possible roles in antiviral resistance.",

     "abstract": "Grain protein content (GPC) in wheat has been a major trait of interest for breeders since it has enormous end use potential. In the present study, marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC) was successfully used to improve GPC in wheat cultivar HUW468. The genotype Glu269 was used as the donor parent for introgression of the gene Gpc-B1 that confers high GPC. In a segregating population, SSR marker Xucw108, with its locus linked to Gpc-B1 was used for foreground selection to select plants carrying Gpc-B1. Background selection, involving 86 polymorphic SSR markers dispersed throughout the genome, was exercised to recover the genome of HUW468. For eliminating linkage drag, markers spanning a 10 cM region around the gene Gpc-B1 were employed to select lines with a donor segment of the minimum size carrying the gene of interest. Improved lines had significantly higher GPC and displayed 88.4–92.3 per cent of the recurrent parent genome (RPG). For grain yield, selected lines were at par with the recurrent parent HUW468, suggesting that there was no yield penalty. The whole exercise of transfer of Gpc-B1 and reconstitution of the genome of HUW468 was completed within a period of two and half years (five crop cycles) demonstrating practical utility of MABC for developing high GPC lines in the background of any elite and popular wheat cultivar with relatively higher speed and precision.(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/).",

     "abstract": "Transfer of mitochondrial genes to the nucleus, and subsequent gain of regulatory elements for expression, is an ongoing evolutionary process in plants. Many examples have been characterized, which in some cases have revealed sources of mitochondrial targeting sequences and cis-regulatory elements. In contrast, there have been no reports of a nuclear gene that has undergone intracellular transfer to the mitochondrial genome and become expressed. Here we show that the orf164 gene in the mitochondrial genome of several Brassicaceae species, including Arabidopsis, is derived from the nuclear ARF17 gene that codes for an auxin responsive protein and is present across flowering plants. Orf164 corresponds to a portion of ARF17, and the nucleotide and amino acid sequences are 79% and 81% identical, respectively. Orf164 is transcribed in several organ types of Arabidopsis thaliana, as detected by RT-PCR. In addition, orf164 is transcribed in five other Brassicaceae within the tribes Camelineae, Erysimeae and Cardamineae, but the gene is not present in Brassica or Raphanus. This study shows that nuclear genes can be transferred to the mitochondrial genome and become expressed, providing a new perspective on the movement of genes between the genomes of subcellular compartments.",

     "abstract": "Accurate annotation of protein function is key to understanding life at the molecular level, but automated annotation of functions is challenging. We here demonstrate the combination of a method for protein function annotation that uses network information to predict the biological processes a protein is involved in, with a sequence-based prediction method. The combined function prediction is based on co-expression networks and combines the network-based prediction method BMRF with the sequence-based prediction method Argot2. The combination shows significantly improved performance compared to each of the methods separately, as well as compared to Blast2GO. The approach was applied to predict biological processes for the proteomes of rice, barrel clover, poplar, soybean and tomato. The novel function predictions are available at www.ab.wur.nl/bmrf. Analysis of the relationships between sequence similarity and predicted function similarity identifies numerous cases of divergence of biological processes in which proteins are involved, in spite of sequence similarity. This indicates that the integration of network-based and sequence-based function prediction is helpful towards the analysis of evolutionary relationships. Examples of potential divergence are identified for various biological processes, notably for processes related to cell development, regulation, and response to chemical stimulus. Such divergence in biological process annotation for proteins with similar sequences should be taken into account when analyzing plant gene and genome evolution.DATA: All gene functions predictions are available online (http://www.ab.wur.nl/bmrf/). The online resource can be queried for predictions of proteins or for Gene Ontology terms of interest, and the results can be downloaded in bulk. Queries can be based on protein identifiers, biological process Gene Ontology identifiers, or text descriptors of biological processes.",

     "abstract": "The mechanism of maternal in vivo haploid induction is not fully understood. In this study, the young embryos were identified by morphology, cytology and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers at different developmental stages in the cross HZ514 (sweet corn) × HZI1 (inducer). The results indicated that the low seed setting rate was determined by the inducer pollen during the process of fertilization. The mosaic endosperm kernels and the different percentages of aneuploidy, mixploidy, lagged chromosome, micronuclei, chromosomal bridge and ring chromosome were found in the cross; 7.37% of the haploid embryos carried chromosome segments from HZI1. About 1% twin seedlings resulted from the cross and were analyzed by cytology and SSR markers. Four pairs of twin seedlings had different chromosome numbers (2n = 20 and 2n = 10–20) and there were some chromosome fragments from HZI1. Aneuploidy, mixploidy and the abnormal chromosomes occurred in the in vivo haploid induction by HZI1, which is the cytological basis for haploid induction and indicates that the inducer's chromosomes are prone to be lost during mitotic and meiotic divisions. Morphological, cellular and molecular evidences reveal that complete or partial chromosome elimination from inducer HZI1 controls the maize in vivo haploid induction.The link refers to the raw data from: Morphological, cellular and molecular evidences of chromosome random elimination in vivo upon haploid induction in maize.
