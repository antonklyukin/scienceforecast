     "abstract": "Pathway balancing is a critical and common challenge for microbial biosynthesis using metabolic engineering approaches. Non-linear biosynthetic pathways, such as diverging and converging pathways, are particularly difficult for bioproduction optimization, because they require delicate balancing between all interconnected constituent pathway modules. The emergence of modular co-culture engineering offers a new perspective for biosynthetic pathways modularization and balancing, as the biosynthetic capabilities of individual pathway modules can be coordinated by flexible adjustment of the subpopulation ratio of the co-culture strains carrying the designated modules. This study developed microbial co-cultures composed of multiple metabolically engineered E. coli strains for heterologous biosynthesis of complex natural product rosmarinic acid (RA) whose biosynthesis involves a complex diverging-converging pathway. Our results showed that, compared with the conventional mono-culture strategy, the engineered two-strain co-cultures significantly improved the RA production. Further pathway modularization and balancing in the context of three-strain co-cultures resulted in additional production improvement. Moreover, metabolically engineered co-culture strains utilizing different carbon substrates were recruited to improve the three-strain co-culture stability. The optimized co-culture based on these efforts produced 172 mg/L RA, exhibiting 38-fold biosynthesis improvement over the parent strain used in mono-culture biosynthesis. The findings of this work demonstrate the strong potentials of modular co-culture engineering for overcoming the challenges of complex natural product biosynthesis involving non-linear pathways.",

     "abstract": "The therapeutic properties of complex terpenes often depend on the stereochemistry of their functional groups. However, stereospecific chemical synthesis of terpenes is challenging. To overcome this challenge, metabolic engineering can be employed using enzymes with suitable stereospecific catalytic activity. Here we used a combinatorial metabolic engineering approach to explore the stereospecific modification activity of the Artemisia annua artemisinic aldehyde ∆11(13) double bond reductase2 (AaDBR2) on products of the feverfew sesquiterpene biosynthesis pathway (GAS, GAO, COS and PTS). This allowed us to produce dihydrocostunolide and dihydroparthenolide. For dihydroparthenolide we demonstrate that the preferred order of biosynthesis of dihydroparthenolide is by reduction of the exocyclic methylene of parthenolide, rather than through C4-C5 epoxidation of dihydrocostunolide. Moreover, we demonstrate a promiscuous activity of feverfew CYP71CB1 on dihydrocostunolide and dihydroparthenolide for the production of 3β-hydroxy-dihydrocostunolide and 3β-hydroxy-dihydroparthenolide, respectively. Combined, these results offer new opportunities for engineering novel sesquiterpene lactones with potentially improved medicinal value.",

Glucosinolates are specialised metabolites of strong commercial interest due to their health-promoting effects. In this work, we engineered the production of benzyl glucosinolate in Escherichia coli. We systematically optimised the production levels by first screening different expression strains and by modification of growth conditions and media compositions. This resulted in production from undetectable to approximately 4.1 μM benzyl glucosinolate, but also approximately 3.7 μM of desulfo-benzyl glucosinolate, the final intermediate of this pathway.

     "abstract": "The genus Pseudomonas comprises approximately 200 species with numerous isolates that are common inhabitants of soil, water, and vegetation and has been of particular interest for more than one hundred years. Here, we present a novel approach for accurate, precise and convenient 13C metabolic flux analysis of these and other microbes possessing periplasmic glucose oxidation and a cyclic hexose metabolism, which forms the recently discovered EDEMP cycle. This complex cyclic architecture cannot be resolved by common metabolic flux workflows, which rely on GC-MS-based labelling analysis of proteinogenic amino acids. Computational analyses revealed that this limitation can be overcome by three parallel labelling experiments on specific tracers, i.e., [1–13C], [6–13C] and 50% [13C6] glucose, with additional consideration of labelling information from glucose and glucosamine. Glucose and glucosamine display building blocks from cellular glycogen, peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharides, reflect the pools of glucose6-phosphate and fructose6-phosphate in the heart of the EDEMP cycle and as we show, can be precisely assessed in biomass hydrolysates by GC-MS. The developed setup created 534 mass isotopomers and enabled high-resolution flux analysis of the cell factory Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and the human pathogen P. aeruginosa PAO1. The latter strain oxidized approximately 90% of its glucose into gluconate via the periplasmic route, whereas only a small fraction of substrate was phosphorylated and consumed via the cytoplasmic route. The oxidative pentose phosphate pathway was completely inactive, indicating the essentiality of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and recycling of triose units into anabolic precursors.In addition to pseudomonads, many microbes operate a cyclic hexose metabolism, which becomes more accessible to flux analysis with this approach. In this regard, the presented approach displays a valuable extension of the available set of flux methods for these types of bacteria.",

     "abstract": "Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in fed-batch cultures are known to consume large amounts of nutrients and divert significant portion of them towards the formation of byproducts, some of which, including lactate and ammonia, are known to be growth inhibitory in nature. A major fraction of these inhibitory metabolites are byproducts or intermediates of amino acid catabolism. Limiting the supply of amino acids has been shown to curtail the production of corresponding inhibitory byproducts resulting in enhanced growth and productivities in CHO cell fed-batch cultures (Mulukutla et al., 2017). In the current study, metabolic engineering of CHO cells was undertaken in order to reduce the biosynthesis of these novel growth inhibitors. Phenylalanine-tyrosine (Phe-Tyr) and branched chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic pathways were engineered as part of this effort. Four genes that encode enzymes in the Phe-Tyr pathway, which were observed to be minimally expressed in CHO cells, were in turn overexpressed. Metabolically engineered cells were prototrophic to tyrosine and had reduced production of the inhibitory byproducts from Phe-Tyr pathway including 3-phenyllactate and 4-hydroxyphenyllactate. In case of BCAA catabolic pathway, branched chain aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1) gene, which encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the catabolism of BCAAs, was knocked out in CHO cells. Knockout (KO) of BCAT1 function completely eliminated production of inhibitory byproducts from BCAA catabolic pathway, including isovalerate, isobutyrate and 2-methylbutyrate, resulting in significantly enhanced cell growth and productivities in fed-batch cultures. This study is first of its kind to demonstrate that metabolic engineering of essential amino acid metabolism of CHO cells can significantly improve cell culture process performance.",

     "abstract": "Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) is a promising biopolyester with good mechanical properties and biodegradability. Large-scale production of PHBV is still hindered by the high production cost. CRISPR/Cas9 method was used to engineer the TCA cycle in Halomonas bluephagenesis on its chromosome for production of PHBV from glucose as a sole carbon source. Two TCA cycle related genes sdhE and icl encoding succinate dehydrogenase assembly factor 2 and isocitrate lysase were deleted, respectively, in H. bluephagenesis TD08AB containing PHBV synthesis genes on the chromosome, to channel more flux to increase the 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) ratio of PHBV. Due to a poor growth behavior of the mutant strains, H. bluephagenesis TY194 equipped with a medium strength Pporin-194 promoter was selected for further studies. The sdhE and/or icl mutant strains of H. bluephagenesis TY194 were constructed to show enhanced cell growth, PHBV synthesis and 3HV molar ratio. Gluconate was used to activate ED pathway and thus TCA cycle to increase 3HV content. H. bluephagenesis TY194 (ΔsdhEΔicl) was found to synthesize 17mol% 3HV in PHBV. Supported by the synergetic function of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and Vitreoscilla hemoglobin encoded by genes ppc and vgb inserted into the chromosome of H. bluephagenesis TY194 (ΔsdhE) serving to enhance TCA cycle activity, a series of strains were generated that could produce PHBV containing 3–18mol% 3HV using glucose as a sole carbon source. Shake flask studies showed that H. bluephagenesis TY194 (ΔsdhE, G7::Pporin-ppc) produced 6.3 g/L cell dry weight (CDW), 65% PHBV in CDW and 25mol% 3HV in PHBV when grown in glucose and gluconate. 25mol% 3HV was the highest reported via chromosomal expression system. PHBV copolymers with different 3HV molar ratios were extracted and characterized. Next-generation industrial biotechnology (NGIB) based on recombinant H. bluephagenesis grown under unsterile and continuous conditions, allows production of P(3HB-0∼25mol% 3HV) in a convenient way with reduced production complexity and cost.",

     "abstract": "Medium-chain (C6-C10) chemicals are important components of fuels, commodities and fine chemicals. Numerous exciting achievements have proven reversed β-oxidation cycle as a promising platform to synthesize these chemicals. However, under native central carbon metabolism, energetic and redox constraints limit the efficient operation of reversed β-oxidation cycle. Current fermentative platform has to use different chemically and energetically inefficient ways for acetyl-CoA and NADH biosynthesis, respectively. The characteristics such as supplementation of additional acetate and formate or high ATP requirement makes this platform incompatible with large-scale production. Here, an artificial micro-aerobic metabolism for energy and carbon-efficient conversion of glycerol to MCFAs was constructed to present solutions towards these barriers. After evaluating numerous bacteria pathways under micro-aerobic conditions, one synthetic metabolic step enabling biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA and NADH simultaneously, without any energy cost and additional carbon requirement, and reducing loss of carbon to carbon dioxide-emitting reactions, was conceived and successfully constructed. The pyruvate dehydrogenase from Enterococcus faecalis was identified and biochemically characterized, demonstrating the most suitable characteristics. Furthermore, the carbon and energy metabolism in Escherichia coli was rewired by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference system, inhibiting native fermentation pathways outcompeting this synthetic step. The present engineered strain exhibited a 15.7-fold increase in MCFA titer compared with that of the initial strain, and produced 15.67 g/L MCFAs from the biodiesel byproduct glycerol in 3-L bioreactor without exogenous feed of acetate or formate, representing the highest MCFA titer reported to date. This work demonstrates this artificial micro-aerobic metabolism has the potential to enable the cost-effective, large-scale production of fatty acids and other value-added reduced chemicals.",

     "abstract": "Gas fermentation is emerging as an economically attractive option for the sustainable production of fuels and chemicals from gaseous waste feedstocks. Clostridium autoethanogenum can use CO and/or CO2 + H2 as its sole carbon and energy sources. Fermentation of C. autoethanogenum is currently being deployed on a commercial scale for ethanol production. Expanding the product spectrum of acetogens will enhance the economics of gas fermentation. To achieve efficient heterologous product synthesis, limitations in redox and energy metabolism must be overcome. Here, we engineered and characterised at a systems-level, a recombinant poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB)-producing strain of C. autoethanogenum. Cells were grown in CO-limited steady-state chemostats on two gas mixtures, one resembling syngas (20% H2) and the other steel mill off-gas (2% H2). Results were characterised using metabolomics and transcriptomics, and then integrated using a genome-scale metabolic model reconstruction. PHB-producing cells had an increased expression of the Rnf complex, suggesting energy limitations for heterologous production. Subsequent optimisation of the bioprocess led to a 12-fold increase in the cellular PHB content. The data suggest that the cellular redox state, rather than the acetyl-CoA pool, was limiting PHB production. Integration of the data into the genome-scale metabolic model showed that ATP availability limits PHB production. Altogether, the data presented here advances the fundamental understanding of heterologous product synthesis in gas-fermenting acetogens.",

     "abstract": "Reprogramming of ‘adult’ differentiated somatic cells to ‘embryonic’ pluripotent stem cells accompanied by increased rate of glycolysis. Conversely, glycolysis triggers accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), a potential causative factor in aging, by promoting methylglyoxal production. Therefore, it is reasonable that pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) would specifically regulate glycolysis to maintain their embryonic features. In this study, we focused on glycine decarboxylase (GLDC), a key enzyme in the glycine cleavage system that regulates glycolysis and methylglyoxal production in cancer. GLDC was exclusively expressed in PSCs, and inhibition of this enzyme induced alterations of metabolome and AGE accumulation, thereby suppressing the embryonic pluripotent state. Surprisingly, the level of accumulated AGEs in somatic cells gradually decreased during reprogramming, ultimately disappearing in iPSCs. In addition, ectopic expression of GLDC or treatment with the AGE inhibitor LR-90 promoted reprogramming. Together, these findings suggest that GLDC-mediated regulation of glycolysis and controlling AGE accumulation is related to maintenance and induction of pluripotency.",

In this study, a highly 3-HP-tolerant strain of Escherichia coli W (tolerance concentration: 400 mM in M9 minimal medium and 800 mM when yeast extract was added) was developed by adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) with glycerol as the carbon source. Genome analysis of the adapted strain (designated as E. coli WA) indicated the presence of mutations in 13 genes, including glpK (glycerol kinase) and yieP (a less-studied global regulator). The mutant GlpK (K67T) exhibited a higher activity than the wild-type enzyme, but it was not beneficial for 3-HP production due to its causing carbon overflow metabolism. Interestingly, among the other 12 genes, the mutation in yieP alone was almost fully responsible for the improved tolerance to 3-HP. When the mutant yieP was substituted with the wild-type counterpart, the adapted E. coli WA strain completely lost its tolerance to 3-HP, showing a tolerance similar to the wild-type W strain. Deletion of yieP conferred 3-HP tolerance to several other E. coli strains including K-12 W3110, K-12 MG1655, and B except BL21 (DE3). The E. coli WA with wild-type glpK showed, as compared with its parental strain, better 3-HP production, indicating that improved tolerance is beneficial for 3-HP production.",

Specifically, the native enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) and O-polysaccharide (O-PS) antigen loci were systematically replaced with ∼9–10 kbp of synthetic DNA encoding Campylobacter jejuni enzymes required for asparagine-linked (N-linked) protein glycosylation. Compared to E. coli cells carrying the same glycosylation machinery on extrachromosomal plasmids, glyco-recoded strains attached glycans to acceptor protein targets with equal or greater efficiency while exhibiting markedly better growth phenotypes and higher glycoprotein titers.

     "abstract": "In microbial fermentations at least 33% of the sugar-substrate carbon is lost as CO2 during pyruvate decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA, with the corresponding electrons lost in the form of H2. Previous attempts to reduce this carbon and electron loss focused on engineering of a single organism. In nature, most microorganisms live in complex communities where syntrophic interactions result in superior resource utilization. Here, we show that a synthetic syntrophy consisting of the solventogen Clostridium acetobutylicum, which converts simple and complex carbohydrates into a variety of chemicals, and the acetogen C. ljungdahlii which fixes CO2, achieved carbon recoveries into C2-C4 alcohols almost to the limit of substrate-electron availability, with minimal H2 and CO2 release. The syntrophic co-culture produced robust metabolic outcomes over a broad range of starting population ratios of the two organisms. We show that direct cell-to-cell interactions and material exchange among the two microbes enabled unforeseen rearrangements in the metabolism of the individual species that resulted in the production of non-native metabolites, namely isopropanol and 2,3-butanediol. This was accomplished by pathway-specific alterations of gene expression brought about by one organism on the other, and vice versa. While some of these gene-expression alterations can be explained by the exchange of metabolites that induce specific gene expression patterns, others, as demonstrated by co-culture setup in a transwell system, cannot. The latter, for now, would be attributed to complex direct physical interactions among the two organisms, thus providing a glimpse of the potential microbial complexity of simple or multicomponent microbiomes. Such direct material-transfer phenomena have not been documented in the literature. Furthermore, our study shows that syntrophic cultures offer a flexible platform for metabolite production with superior carbon recovery that can also be applied to electron-enhanced fermentations enabling even higher carbon recoveries.",

     "abstract": "Terpenoids are the most diverse natural products with many industrial applications and are all synthesized from simple precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). In plants, IPP is synthesized by two distinct metabolic pathways – cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway for C15 sesquiterpene and C30 triterpene, and plastidic methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway for C10 monoterpene and C20 diterpene. A number of studies have altered the metabolic gene expressions in either the MVA or MEP pathway to increase terpene production; however, it remains unknown if the alteration of the acetyl-CoA pool in plastid fatty acid biosynthesis can influence terpenoid flux. Here, we focused on the fact that acetyl-CoA is the precursor for both fatty acid biosynthesis in plastid and terpene biosynthesis in cytosol, and the metabolic impact of increased plastidic acetyl-CoA level on the cytosolic terpene biosynthesis was investigated. In tobacco leaf infiltration studies, the acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex (the enzyme supplying malonyl-CoA in plastid) was partially inhibited by overexpressing the inactive form of biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) by a negative dominant effect. Overexpression of BCCP showed 1.4–2.4-fold increase of sesquiterpenes in cytosol; however, surprisingly overexpression of BCCP linked to truncated HMG-CoA reductase (tHMGR) by a cleavable peptide 2A showed 20–40-fold increases of C15 sesquiterpenes (α-bisabolol, amorphadiene, and valerenadiene) and a 6-fold increase of C30 β-amyrin. α-Bisabolol and β-amyrin production reached 28.8 mg g-1 and 9.8 mg g-1 dry weight, respectively. Detailed analyses showed that a large increase in flux was achieved by the additive effect of BCCP- and tHMGR-overexpression, and an enhanced tHMGR activity by 2A peptide tag.

     "abstract": "Large-scale kinetic models are used for designing, predicting, and understanding the metabolic responses of living cells. Kinetic models are particularly attractive for the biosynthesis of target molecules in cells as they are typically better than other types of models at capturing the complex cellular biochemistry. Using simpler stoichiometric models as scaffolds, kinetic models are built around a steady-state flux profile and a metabolite concentration vector that are typically determined via optimization. However, as the underlying optimization problem is underdetermined, even after incorporating available experimental omics data, one cannot uniquely determine the operational configuration in terms of metabolic fluxes and metabolite concentrations. As a result, some reactions can operate in either the forward or reverse direction while still agreeing with the observed physiology. Here, we analyze how the underlying uncertainty in intracellular fluxes and concentrations affects predictions of constructed kinetic models and their design in metabolic engineering and systems biology studies. To this end, we integrated the omics data of optimally grown Escherichia coli into a stoichiometric model and constructed populations of non-linear large-scale kinetic models of alternative steady-state solutions consistent with the physiology of the E. coli aerobic metabolism. We performed metabolic control analysis (MCA) on these models, highlighting that MCA-based metabolic engineering decisions are strongly affected by the selected steady state and appear to be more sensitive to concentration values rather than flux values. To incorporate this into future studies, we propose a workflow for moving towards more reliable and robust predictions that are consistent with all alternative steady-state solutions. This workflow can be applied to all kinetic models to improve the consistency and accuracy of their predictions. Additionally, we show that, irrespective of the alternative steady-state solution, increased activity of phosphofructokinase and decreased ATP maintenance requirements would improve cellular growth of optimally grown E. coli.",

Despite the success in employing genome-scale modeling coupled with flux balance analysis to engineer heterotrophic metabolism, the lack of proper constraints necessary to generate biologically realistic predictions has hindered broad application of this methodology to phototrophic metabolism. Here we describe a methodology for constraining genome-scale models of photoautotrophy in the cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. Experimental photophysiology parameters coupled to genome-scale flux balance analysis resulted in accurate predictions of growth rates and metabolic reaction fluxes at low and high light conditions. Additionally, by constraining photon uptake fluxes, we characterized the metabolic cost of excess excitation energy. The predicted energy fluxes were consistent with known light-adapted phenotypes in cyanobacteria. Finally, we leveraged the modeling framework to characterize existing photoautotrophic and photomixtotrophic engineering strategies for 2,3-butanediol production in S. elongatus. This methodology, applicable to genome-scale modeling of all phototrophic microorganisms, can facilitate the use of flux balance analysis in the engineering of light-driven metabolism.",

RNA seq analysis on CHO host cells (DG44) treated with rhBMP-4 (20 µg/mL) suggested that rhBMP-4 induced signaling in CHO cells could be a critical factor in limiting rhBMP-4 production and should be removed to improve rhBMP-4 production in recombinant CHO (rCHO) cells. The inhibition of autocrine BMP signaling in CHO-BMP-4 cells by the addition of LDN-193189, a chemical inhibitor of BMP receptor type I, significantly increased the mRNA expression levels of rhBMP-4. To establish BMP signaling-free host cells, a BMP receptor, the BMPRIA or BMPRII gene in DG44 cells, was knocked out using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology. Using three different knockout (KO) host cell lines as well as a DG44 wild-type (wt) cell line, rCHO cell clones producing rhBMP-4 were generated by a stepwise selection with increasing methotrexate concentrations. KO-derived clones showed a significantly higher maximum rhBMP-4 concentration than wt-derived clones in both batch and fed-batch cultures. Unlike wt-derived clones, KO-derived cell clones were able to produce higher amounts of hBMP-4 transcripts and proteins in the stationary phase of growth and did not experience growth inhibition induced by rhBMP-4. The mean maximum rhBMP-4 concentration of KO host-derived clones was approximately 2.4-fold higher than that of wt-derived clones (P < 0.05). Taken together, the disruption of BMP signaling in CHO cells by knocking out the BMP receptor significantly improved rhBMP-4 production.",

The physiological characterization included measurement of the amount of residual glucose in the spent medium and analysis of oxygen uptake- and production rates.

Via exogenous addition of retinal analogue an infrared absorbing pigment (maximally at 740 nm) was reconstituted in vivo. However, upon illumination with 746 nm light, it did not significantly stimulate the growth (rate) of this mutant.

     "abstract": "Increasing the availability of NADPH is commonly used to improve lysine production by Corynebacterium glutamicum since 4 mol of NADPH are required for the synthesis of 1 mol of lysine. Alternatively, engineering of enzymes in lysine synthesis pathway to utilize NADH directly can also be explored for cofactor balance during lysine overproduction. To achieve such a goal, enzyme mining was used in this study to quickly identify a full set of NADH-utilizing dehydrogenases, namely aspartate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaASPDH), aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase from Tistrella mobilis (TmASADH), dihydrodipicolinate reductase from Escherichia coli (EcDHDPR), and diaminopimelate dehydrogenase from Pseudothermotoga thermarum (PtDAPDH). This allowed us to systematically perturb cofactor utilization of lysine synthesis pathway of C. glutamicum for the first time. Individual overexpression of PaASPDH, TmASADH, EcDHDPR, and PtDAPDH in C. glutamicum LC298, a basic lysine producer, increased the production of lysine by 30.7%, 32.4%, 17.4%, and 36.8%, respectively. Combinatorial replacement of NADPH-dependent dehydrogenases in C. glutamicum ATCC 21543, a lysine hyperproducer, also resulted in significantly improved lysine production. The highest increase of lysine production (30.7%) was observed for a triple-mutant strain (27.7 g/L, 0.35 g/g glucose) expressing PaASPDH, TmASADH, and EcDHDPR. A quadruple-mutant strain expressing all of the four NADH-utilizing enzymes allowed high lysine production (24.1 g/L, 0.30 g/g glucose) almost independent of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. Collectively, our results demonstrated that a combination of enzyme mining and cofactor engineering was a highly efficient approach to improve lysine production. Similar strategies can be applied for the production of other amino acids or their derivatives.",

     "abstract": "The biosynthesis of surfactin has attracted broad interest; however, there is a bottleneck in its low yield in wild strains and the ability to engineer Bacillus producers. Because the key metabolic mechanisms in the surfactin synthesis pathway remain unclear, genetic engineering approaches are all ending up with a single or a few gene modifications. The aim of this study is to develop a systematic engineering approach to improve the biosynthesis of surfactin. First, we restored surfactin biosynthetic activity by integrating a complete sfp gene into the nonproducing Bacillus subtilis 168 strain and obtained a surfactin titer of 0.4 g/l. Second, we reduced competition by deleting biofilm formation-related genes and nonribosomal peptide synthetases/polyketide synthase pathways (3.8% of the total genome), which increased the surfactin titer by 3.3-fold. Third, we improved cellular tolerance to surfactin by overexpressing potential self-resistance-associated proteins, which further increased the surfactin titer by 8.5-fold. Fourth, we increased the supply of precursor branched-chain fatty acids by engineering the branched-chain fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, resulting in an increase of the surfactin titer to 8.5 g/l (a 20.3-fold increase). Finally, due to the preference of the glycolytic pathway for cell growth, we diverted precursor acetyl-CoA away from cell growth to surfactin biosynthesis by enhancing the transcription of srfA. The final surfactin titer increased to 12.8 g/l, with a yield of 65.0 mmol/mol sucrose (42% of the theoretical yield) in the metabolically engineered strain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest titer and yield that has been reported. This study may pave the way for the commercial production of green surfactin. More broadly, our work presents another successful example of the modularization of metabolic pathways for improving titer and yield in biotechnological production.",

However, lignocellulosic hydrolysis not only frees sugars for fermentation it simultaneously generates toxic chemicals, including phenolic compounds which severely inhibit yeast fermentation. To understand the molecular basis of phenolic compound toxicity, we performed genome-wide chemogenomic screens in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify deletion mutants that were either hypersensitive or resistant to three common phenolic compounds found in plant hydrolysates: coniferyl aldehyde, ferulic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Despite being similar in structure, our screen revealed that yeast utilizes distinct pathways to tolerate phenolic compound exposure. Furthermore, although each phenolic compound induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), ferulic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid-induced a general cytoplasmic ROS distribution while coniferyl aldehyde-induced ROS partially localized to the mitochondria and to a lesser extent, the endoplasmic reticulum. We found that the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme Zwf1, which catalyzes the rate limiting step of pentose phosphate pathway, is required for reducing the accummulation of coniferyl aldehyde-induced ROS, potentially through the sequestering of Zwf1 to sites of ROS accumulation. Our novel insights into biological impact of three common phenolic inhibitors will inform the engineering of yeast strains with improved efficiency of biofuel and biochemical production in the presence hydrolysate-derived phenolic compounds.",

     "abstract": "Capitalizing on the ability of mammalian cells to conduct complex post-translational modifications, most protein therapeutics are currently produced in cell culture systems. Addition of a signal peptide to the product protein enables its accumulation in the cell culture supernatant, but separation of the product from endogenously secreted proteins remains costly and labor-intensive. We considered that global downregulation of translation of non-product proteins would be an efficient strategy to minimize downstream processing requirements. Therefore, taking advantage of the ability of mammalian protein kinase R (PKR) to switch off most cellular translation processes in response to infection by viruses, we fused a caffeine-inducible dimerization domain to the catalytic domain of PKR. Addition of caffeine to this construct results in homodimerization and activation of PKR, effectively rewiring rapid global translational downregulation to the addition of the stimulus in a dose-dependent manner. Then, to protect translation of the target therapeutic, we screened viral and cellular internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESes) known or suspected to be resistant to PKR-induced translational stress. After choosing the best-in-class Seneca valley virus (SVV) IRES, we additionally screened for IRES transactivation factors (ITAFs) as well as for supplementary small molecules to further boost the production titer of the product protein under conditions of global translational downregulation. Importantly, the residual global translation activity of roughly 10% under maximal downregulation is sufficient to maintain cellular viability during a production timeframe of at least five days. Standard industrially used adherent as well as suspension-adapted cell lines transfected with this synthetic biology-inspired Protein Kinase R-Enhanced Protein Production (PREPP) system could produce several medicinally relevant protein therapeutics, such as the blockbuster drug rituximab, in substantial quantities and with significantly higher purity than previous culture technologies. We believe incorporation of such purity-by-design technology in the production process will alleviate downstream processing bottlenecks in future biopharmaceutical manufacturing.",

Extensive previous work has demonstrated the broad biological activity of these flavonoids, such as antifibrotic, antiviral and anticancer properties. However, their supply from plant material is insufficient to meet demand. Here, to provide an alternative production source and increase production levels of these flavones, we engineered an artificial pathway in an Escherichia coli cell factory for the first time. By first reconstructing the plant flavonoid biosynthetic pathway genes from five different species: phenylalanine ammonia lyase from Rhodotorula toruloides (PAL), 4-coumarate-coenzyme A ligase from Petroselinum crispum (4CL), chalcone synthase from Petunia hybrida (CHS), chalcone isomerase from Medicago sativa (CHI) and an oxidoreductase flavone synthase I from P. crispum (FNSI), production of the intermediates chrysin and apigenin was achieved by feeding phenylalanine and tyrosine as precursors. By comparative analysis of various versions of P450s, a construction expressing 2B1 incorporated with a 22-aa N-terminal truncated flavone C-6 hydroxylase from S. baicalensis (F6H) and partner P450 reductase from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtCPR) was found most effective for production of both baicalein (8.5 mg/L) and scutellarein (47.1 mg/L) upon supplementation with 0.5 g/L phenylalanine and tyrosine in 48 h of fermentation. Finally, optimization of malonyl-CoA availability further increased the production of baicalein to 23.6 mg/L and scutellarein to 106.5 mg/L in a flask culture.

To focus on TAG metabolism in order to increase lycopene accumulation, we overexpressed key genes associated with fatty acid synthesis and TAG production, followed by modulation of TAG fatty acyl composition by overexpressing a fatty acid desaturase (OLE1) and deletion of Seipin (FLD1), which regulates lipid-droplet size. Results showed that the engineered strain produced 70.5 mg lycopene/g cdw, a 25% increase relative to the original high-yield strain, with lycopene production reaching 2.37 g/L and 73.3 mg/g cdw in fed-batch fermentation and representing the highest lycopene yield in S. cerevisiae reported to date.

Deriving therapeutic proteins from human plasma is generally a cost-intensive process and also harbors a risk of transmitting infectious particles.

This was achieved by combining CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of 10 gene targets with overexpression of human ST6GAL1. We were able to show that the N-linked glyco-structures of rhA1AT and rhC1INH are homogeneous and similar to the structures obtained from plasma-derived A1AT and C1INH, marketed as Prolastin®-C and Cinryze®, respectively. rhA1AT and rhC1INH produced in our glyco-engineered cell line showed no detectable differences to their plasma-purified counterparts on SDS-PAGE and had similar enzymatic in vitro activity. The work presented here shows the potential of expanding the glyco-engineering toolbox for CHO cells to produce a wider variety of glycoproteins with fully humanized N-glycan profiles.

However, stable, multi-copy integration of long DNA segments (e.g., large gene clusters) remains challenging. Here, we describe a plug-and-play toolkit that allows for high-efficiency, single-step, multi-locus integration of natural product (NP) biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in actinomycetes, based on the innovative concept of “multiple integrases-multiple attB sites”. This toolkit consists of 27 synthetic modular plasmids, which contain single- or multi-integration modules (from two to four) derived from five orthogonal site-specific recombination (SSR) systems. The multi-integration modules can be readily ligated into plasmids containing large BGCs by Gibson assembly, which can be simultaneously inserted into multiple native attB sites in a single step. We demonstrated the applicability of this toolkit by performing stabilized amplification of acetyl-CoA carboxylase genes to facilitate actinorhodin biosynthesis in Streptomyces coelicolor. Furthermore, using this toolkit, we achieved a 185.6% increase in 5-oxomilbemycin titers (from 2.23 to 6.37 g/L) in Streptomyces hygroscopicus via the multi-locus integration of the entire 5-oxomilbemycin BGC (72 kb) (up to four copies). Compared with previously reported methods, the advanced multiplex site-specific genome engineering (aMSGE) method does not require the introduction of any modifications into host genomes before the amplification of target genes or BGCs, which will drastically simplify and accelerate efforts to improve NP production. Considering that SSR systems are widely distributed in a variety of industrial microbes, this novel technique also promises to be a valuable tool for the enhanced biosynthesis of other high-value bioproducts.",

     "abstract": "Overcoming carbon catabolite repression presents a significant challenge, largely due to the complex regulatory networks governing substrate catabolism, even in microbial cells. In this work, we have engineered an E. coli strain, which we have named X2G, that not only exhibits a reversed substrate preference for xylose over glucose, but also demonstrates an unusual ability to produce significant amounts of glucose. We obtained this non-intuitive phenotype by deleting four genes in upper central metabolism: ptsI, glk, pfkA, and zwf, which respectively encode Enzyme I of the phosphotransferase system, glucokinase, the dominant isozyme of phosphofructokinase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The deletion of ptsI and glk blocks glucose uptake in E. coli, while the deletion of pfkA and zwf prevents the reassimilation of carbons through glycolysis and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, respectively. Our strain X2G is capable of converting 34% of the carbon it takes up as xylose into exported glucose. This corresponds to a glucose production rate of 1.4 ± 0.3 mmol/gDW/h at a specific growth rate of 0.25 ± 0.03 h−1, or about 1.8 ± 0.1 mM of glucose accumulated for every unit increase in OD600. Despite a 22% decrease in xylose uptake rate, a 33% decrease in biomass yield, and a 52% decrease in acetate production rate relative to the wild-type, the intracellular flux profile and cofactor allocation of X2G remain largely unperturbed, as elucidated through 13C-metabolic flux analysis. Further quantification of the pool sizes of key intracellular metabolites revealed that glucose secretion by X2G is likely driven by the substantial accumulation of intracellular glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, glucose and fructose at levels greater than 20x of that in wild-type E. coli. Combined, our results shed light on the flexibility of central metabolism, and the opportunities this affords for producing value-added pentose- and hexose-derived products from lignocellulosic feedstocks.",

     "abstract": "Carotenoid pigments are valuable components of the human diet. A notable example is β-carotene, or provitamin A, which is converted into the derivatives astaxanthin and capsanthin, via the common intermediate zeaxanthin. To generate rice varieties producing diverse carotenoids beyond β-carotene, we specifically used a Capsicum β-carotene hydroxylase gene, B (Ca B ch) and a codon optimized version of the same gene, stB ( stB ch) to increase zeaxanthin synthesis. We also used a recombinant BAK gene (Ca B ch-2 A -HpB k t), consisting of the CaBch sequence and a Haematococcus β-carotene ketolase gene (HpBkt) linked by a bicistronic 2 A sequence, as well as a codon optimized recombinant stBAK gene ( stB ch-2 A -stB k t) to create astaxanthin synthesis. The four cassettes to seed-specifically express the B, stB, BAK and stBAK genes were individually combined with a PAC gene (Ca P sy-2 A -Pa C rtI) cassette to previously impart β-carotene-enriched trait in rice endosperm. The single T-DNA vectors of B-PAC, stB-PAC, BAK-PAC and stBAK-PAC resulted in the accumulation of zeaxanthin and astaxanthin in the endosperm of the transgenic rice seeds. In addition, an extended version on the carotenoid pathway was introduced into rice to allow the production of capsanthin, by intercrossing a B-PAC rice line with a Ccs rice line, which harbors a Capsicum capsanthin-capsorubin synthase gene. Ultimately, we developed three functional rice varieties: B-PAC (0.8 μg/g zeaxanthin, deep yellow), stBAK-PAC (1.4 μg/g ketocarotenoids, including astaxanthin, pinkish red) and B-PAC x Ccs (0.4 μg/g of ketoxanthophylls, including capsanthin, orange-red) with the similar levels of total carotenoids to PAC rice, suggesting the capacity was dependent on β-carotene levels. Collectively, a combination of genetic engineering and conventional breeding is effective for multi-step metabolic engineering and biochemical pathway extension.",

     "abstract": "Starvation of essential nutrients, such as nitrogen, sulfur, magnesium, and phosphorus, leads cells into stationary phase and potentially enhances target metabolite production because cells do not consume carbon for the biomass synthesis. The overall metabolic behavior changes depend on the type of nutrient starvation in Escherichia coli. In the present study, we determined the optimum nutrient starvation type for producing malonyl-CoA-derived metabolites such as 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) and naringenin in E. coli. For 3HP production, high production titer (2.3 or 2.0 mM) and high specific production rate (0.14 or 0.28 mmol gCDW−1 h−1) was observed under sulfur or magnesium starvation, whereas almost no 3HP production was detected under nitrogen or phosphorus starvation. Metabolic profiling analysis revealed that the intracellular malonyl-CoA concentration was significantly increased under the 3HP producing conditions. This accumulation should contribute to the 3HP production because malonyl-CoA is a precursor of 3HP. Strong positive correlation (r = 0.95) between intracellular concentrations of ATP and malonyl-CoA indicates that the ATP level is important for malonyl-CoA synthesis due to the ATP requirement by acetyl-CoA carboxylase. For naringenin production, magnesium starvation led to the highest production titer (144 ± 15 μM) and specific productivity (127 ± 21 μmol gCDW−1). These results demonstrated that magnesium starvation is a useful approach to improve the metabolic state of strains engineered for the production of malonyl-CoA derivatives.",

     "abstract": "Aspergillus niger was engineered using a gene responsible for citric acid transport, which has a significant impact on citric acid secretion when overexpressed. The transport gene was identified by a homology search using an itaconic acid transporter from Ustilago maydis as template. The encoding homologous protein CexA belongs to the major facilitator superfamily subclass DHA1 and members of this family work as drug-H+ antiporter. The disruption of this gene completely abolishes citric acid secretion, which indicates that this protein is the main citric acid transporter in A. niger. In the disruption strain, the metabolism is re-routed mainly to oxalic acid, which is a known by-product during citric acid production. The gene can be heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which leads to the secretion of citric acid during the growth on glucose. These results confirm the functionality of CexA as the main transporter for citric acid of A. niger. Overexpression of cexA leads to a significant increase in secreted citric acid. Thereby, striking differences between a strong constitutive expression system using pmbfA as a promoter and an inducible expression system using ptet-on can be observed. The inducible system significantly outcompetes the constitutive expression system yielding up to 109 g/L citric acid, which is 5 times higher compared to the parental wild-type strain and 3 times higher compared to the constitutive expression system. These results demonstrate the importance of the cellular transport system for an efficient production of metabolites. By overexpressing a single gene, it is possible to significantly improve the citric acid secretion capability of a moderately producing parental strain.",

Inclusion of these human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) in infant formula can recapitulate these health benefits. As a result, there is substantial commercial interest in a cost-effective source of HMOs as infant formula ingredients. Here we demonstrate that the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica both can be engineered to produce 2′-fucosyllactose (2′FL), which is the most abundant oligosaccharide in human breast milk, at high titer and productivity. Both yeast species were modified to enable uptake of lactose and synthesis of GDP-fucose – the two precursors of 2′FL – by installing a lactose transporter and enzymes that convert GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose. Production of 2′FL was then enabled by expression of α-1,2-fucosyltransferases from various organisms. By screening candidate transporters from a variety of sources, we identified transporters capable of exporting 2′FL from yeast, which is a key consideration for any biocatalyst for 2′FL production. In particular, we identified CDT2 from Neurospora crassa as a promising target for further engineering to improve 2′FL efflux. Finally, we demonstrated production of 2′FL in fermenters at rates and titers that indicate the potential of engineered S. cerevisiae and Y. lipolytica strains for commercial 2′FL production.",

Several routes of intermediates, depending on the sequence of action of these enzymes, lead to the formation of astaxanthin. In the present study, the enzyme activities of 3, 3ˈ β-carotene hydroxylase (CRTZ) and 4, 4ˈ β-carotene oxygenase (CRTW) have been combined through the creation of “new to nature” enzyme fusions in order to overcome leakage of non-endogenous intermediates and pleotropic effects associated with their high levels in plants. The utility of flexible linker sequences of varying size has been assessed in the construction of pZ-W enzyme fusions. Frist, in vivo color complementation assays in Escherichia coli have been used to evaluate the potential of the fusion enzymes. Analysis of the carotenoid pigments present in strains generated indicated that the enzyme fusions only possess both catalytic activities when CRTZ is attached as the N-terminal module. Astaxanthin levels in E. coli cells were increased by 1.4-fold when the CRTZ and CRTW enzymes were fused compared to the individual enzymes. Transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana was then performed in order to assess the potential of the fusions in a plant system. The production of valuable ketocarotenoids was achieved using this plant-based transient expression system. This revealed that CRTZ and CRTW, transiently expressed as a fusion, accumulated similar levels of astaxanthin compared to the expression of the individual enzymes whilst being associated with reduced ketocarotenoid intermediate levels (e.g. phoenicoxanthin, canthaxanthin and 3-OH-echinenone) and a reduced rate of leaf senescence after transformation. Therefore, the quality of the plant material producing the ketocarotenoids was enhanced due to a reduction in the stress induced by the accumulation of high levels of heterologous ketocarotenoid intermediates. The size of the linkers appeared to have no effect upon activity. The potential of the approach to production of valuable plant derived products is discussed.",

This process requires rapid chromosomal integration of heterologous chemical biosynthetic pathways, which is impeded by the absence of genetic tools competent for efficient genome engineering in these anaerobes. Here, we developed a phage serine integrase-mediated site-specific genome engineering technique in Clostridium ljungdahlii, one of the major acetogenic gas-fermenting microbes. Two heterologous phage attachment/integration (Att/Int) systems (from Clostridium difficile and Streptomyces) were introduced into C. ljungdahlii and proven to be highly active, achieving efficient chromosomal integration of a whole donor vector via single-crossover recombination. Based on this, we further realized markerless chromosomal integration of target DNA fragments through a “dual integrase cassette exchange” (DICE) strategy with the assistance of the CRISPR-Cas9 editing system. As a proof of concept, a butyric acid production pathway from Clostridium acetobutylicum was integrated into the C. ljungdahlii genome without the introduction of extra markers, enabling stable expression of the pathway genes. The resulting engineered strain produced 1.01 g/L of butyric acid within 3 days by fermenting synthesis gas (CO2/CO). More importantly, the engineered strain showed good genetic stability and maintained butyric acid production ability after continuous subculturing. The system developed in this study overcomes the deficiencies of currently available genetic tools in the chromosomal integration of large DNA fragments (rapid, markerless and stable) in C. ljungdahlii, and may be extended to other Clostridium species.",

The experiments were carried out in a 2L bioreactor, using defined medium enriched with 20% 13C-labeled glucose. Metabolic flux distributions in central carbon pathways of S. typhimurium LT2 were estimated using OpenFLUX2 based on the labeling pattern of biomass protein hydrolysates together with biomass composition. The results suggested that pentose phosphate is used to catabolize glucose, with minor fluxes through glycolysis. In silico simulations, using Optflux and pFBA as simulation method, allowed to study the performance of the genome-scale metabolic model. In general, the accuracy of in silico simulations was improved by the superimposition of estimated intracellular fluxes to the existing genome-scale metabolic model, showing a better fitting to the experimental extracellular fluxes, whereas the intracellular fluxes of pentose phosphate and anaplerotic reactions were poorly described.",

RpoD mutants were isolated that resulted in full-length antibody titers of up to 130.7 ± 6.6 mg/L of shake flask culture with chaperone co-expression. These results could be useful for production of several antibodies quickly in shake flasks for characterization (e.g. antigen binding, biological function) during the early discovery phase.",

     "abstract": "Efficient microbial production of the next-generation biofuel isobutanol (IBA) is limited by metabolic bottlenecks. Overcoming these bottlenecks will be aided by knowing the optimal ratio of enzymes for efficient flux through the IBA biosynthetic pathway. OptSSeq ( Opt imization by S election and Seq uencing) accomplishes this goal by tracking growth rate-linked selection of optimal expression elements from a combinatorial library. The 5-step pathway to IBA consists of Acetolactate synthase (AlsS), Keto-acid reductoisomerase (KARI), Di-hydroxy acid dehydratase (DHAD), Ketoisovalerate decarboxylase (Kivd) and Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh). Using OptSSeq, we identified gene expression elements leading to optimal enzyme levels that enabled theoretically maximal productivities per cell biomass in Escherichia coli. We identified KARI as the rate-limiting step, requiring the highest levels of enzymes expression, followed by AlsS and AdhA. DHAD and Kivd required relatively lower levels of expression for optimal IBA production. OptSSeq also enabled the identification of an Adh enzyme variant capable of an improved rate of IBA production. Using models that predict impacts of enzyme synthesis costs on cellular growth rates, we found that optimum levels of pathway enzymes led to maximal IBA production, and that additional limitations lie in the E. coli metabolic network. Our optimized constructs enabled the production of ~3 g IBA per hour per gram dry cell weight and was achieved with 20 % of the total cell protein devoted to IBA-pathway enzymes in the molar ratio 2.5:6.7:2:1:5.2 (AlsS:IlvC:IlvD:Kivd:AdhA). These enzyme levels and ratios optimal for IBA production in E. coli provide a useful starting point for optimizing production of IBA in diverse microbes and fermentation conditions.",

Currently, industrial production of simvastatin acid (SVA) is a multistep process starting from the natural product lovastatin. For this reason, there is significant interest in direct production of simvastatin from a microbial host. In this study, six heterologous biosynthetic genes were introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the acyl-donor dimethylbutyryl-S-methyl mercaptopropionate (DMB-SMMP) was added, resulting in initial production of 0.5 mg/L SVA. Switching the yeast strain from JHY686 to BJ5464-NpgA increased total polyketide production to over 60 mg/L and conversion from dihydromonacolin L acid to monacolin J acid (MJA) was increased from 60% to 90% by tuning the copy number of the P450 lovA. Increasing the media pH to 8.7 led to a further 10-fold increase in SVA production. Optimized chemical lysis of the cell walls in situ after maximum MJA production led to 55 mg/L SVA titer, representing nearly complete conversion from MJA and a 110-fold increase in titer from the initial SVA production strain. The yeast strains developed in this work can be used as an alternative production method for SVA, and the strategies employed can be broadly applied for heterologous production of other fungal polyketides and semisynthetic compounds in yeast.",

However, industrial strategies for upstream process development are based on empirical results, due to a lack of fundamental understanding of intracellular activities. Genome scale models of CHO cells have been reconstructed to provide an economical way of analyzing and interpreting large-omics datasets, since they add cellular context to the data. Here the most recently available CHO-DG44 genome-scale specific model was manually curated and tailored to the metabolic profile of cell lines used for industrial protein production, by modifying 601 reactions. Generic changes were applied to simplify the model and cope with missing constraints related to regulatory effects as well as thermodynamic and osmotic forces. Cell line specific changes were related to the metabolism of high-yielding production cell lines. The model was semi-constrained with 24 metabolites measured on a daily basis in n = 4 independent industrial 2L fed batch cell culture processes for a therapeutic antibody production.This study is the first adaptation of a genome scale model for CHO cells to an industrial process, that successfully predicted cell phenotype. The tailored model predicted accurately both the exometabolomics data (r2 ≥ 0.8 for 96% of the considered metabolites) and growth rate (r2 = 0.91) of the industrial cell line. Flux distributions at different days of the process were analyzed for validation and suggestion of strategies for medium optimization. This study shows how to adapt a genome scale model to an industrial process and sheds light on the metabolic specificities of a high production process. The curated genome scale model is a great tool to gain insights into intracellular fluxes and to identify possible bottlenecks impacting cell performances during production process. The general use of genome scale models for modeling industrial recombinant cell lines is a long-term investment that will highly benefit process development and speed up time to market.",

     "abstract": "One of the primary goals of microbial metabolic engineering is to achieve high titer, yield and productivity (TYP) of engineered strains. This TYP index requires optimized carbon flux toward desired molecule with minimal by-product formation. De novo redesign of central carbon and redox metabolism holds great promise to alleviate pathway bottleneck and improve carbon and energy utilization efficiency. The engineered strain, with the overexpression or deletion of multiple genes, typically can’t meet the TYP index, due to overflow of central carbon and redox metabolism that compromise the final yield, despite a high titer or productivity might be achieved. To solve this challenge, we reprogramed the central carbon and redox metabolism of Bacillus subtilis and achieved high TYP production of N-acetylglucosamine. Specifically, a “push–pull–promote” approach efficiently reduced the overflown acetyl-CoA flux and eliminated byproduct formation. Four synthetic NAD(P)-independent metabolic routes were introduced to rewire the redox metabolism to minimize energy loss. Implementation of these genetic strategies led us to obtain a B. subtilis strain with superior TYP index. GlcNAc titer in shake flask was increased from 6.6 g L−1 to 24.5 g L−1, the yield was improved from 0.115 to 0.468 g GlcNAc g−1 glucose, and the productivity was increased from 0.274 to 0.437 g L−1 h−1. These titer and yield are the highest levels ever reported and, the yield reached 98% of the theoretical pathway yield (0.478 g g−1 glucose). The synthetic redesign of carbon metabolism and redox metabolism represent a novel and general metabolic engineering strategy to improve the performance of microbial cell factories.",

Over the years, these properties have been capitalized biotechnologically owing to the expanding wealth of genetic tools designed for deep-editing the P. putida genome. A suite of dedicated vectors inspired in the core tenets of synthetic biology have enabled to suppress many of the naturally-occurring undesirable traits native to this species while enhancing its many appealing properties, and also to import catalytic activities and attributes from other biological systems. Much of the biotechnological interest on P. putida stems from the distinct architecture of its central carbon metabolism. The native biochemistry is naturally geared to generate reductive currency [i.e., NAD(P)H] that makes this bacterium a phenomenal host for redox-intensive reactions. In some cases, genetic editing of the indigenous biochemical network of P. putida (cis-metabolism) has sufficed to obtain target compounds of industrial interest. Yet, the main value and promise of this species (in particular, strain KT2440) resides not only in its capacity to host heterologous pathways from other microorganisms, but also altogether artificial routes (trans-metabolism) for making complex, new-to-Nature molecules. A number of examples are presented for substantiating the worth of P. putida as one of the favorite workhorses for sustainable manufacturing of fine and bulk chemicals in the current times of the 4th Industrial Revolution. The potential of P. putida to extend its rich native biochemistry beyond existing boundaries is discussed and research bottlenecks to this end are also identified. These aspects include not just the innovative genetic design of new strains but also the incorporation of novel chemical elements into the extant biochemistry, as well as genomic stability and scaling-up issues.",

This review establishes a case for Y. lipolytica as a premier metabolic engineering host based on innate metabolic capacity, emerging synthetic tools, and engineering examples. The metabolism underlying the lipid accumulation phenotype of this yeast as well as high flux through acyl-CoA precursors and the TCA cycle provide a favorable metabolic environment for expression of relevant heterologous pathways.

     "abstract": "Triterpene cyclases catalyze the first committed step in triterpene biosynthesis, by forming mono- to pentacyclic backbone structures from oxygenated C30 isoprenoid precursors. Squalene epoxidase precedes this cyclization by providing the oxygenated and activated substrate for triterpene biosynthesis. Three squalene epoxidases from Cucurbita pepo (CpSEs) were isolated and shown to have evolved under purifying selection with signs of sites under positive selection in their N- and C-termini. They all localize to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and produce 2,3-oxidosqualene and 2,3:22,23-dioxidosqualene when expressed in a yeast erg1 (squalene epoxidase) erg7 (lanosterol synthase) double mutant. Co-expression of the CpSEs with four different triterpene cyclases, either transiently in Nicotiana benthamiana or constitutively in yeast, showed that CpSEs boost triterpene production. CpSE2 was the best performing in this regard, which could reflect either increased substrate production or superior channeling of the substrate to the triterpene cyclases. Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) analysis with C. pepo cucurbitadienol synthase (CpCPQ) revealed a specific interaction with CpSE2 but not with the other CpSEs. When CpSE2 was transformed into C. pepo hairy root lines, cucurbitacin E production was increased two folds compared to empty vector control lines. This study provides new insight into the importance of SEs in triterpene biosynthesis, suggesting that they may facilitate substrate channeling, and demonstrates that SE overexpression is a new tool for increasing triterpene production in plants and yeast.",

In this study, we outlined a modular design to quickly assemble scaffold proteins using protein interaction domains, which have been constructed into a standardized vector. We generated multiple protein interaction domains and ligands for making artificial scaffold proteins. At the same time, we developed a robust Golden-Gate-based molecular toolkit for the construction of artificial scaffold proteins, allowing a variance of domain types, number, and positions. The synthesized domain-ligand interaction was verified by yeast two-hybrid and split-GFP assays. Using synthetic scaffolds, we demonstrated an increase in the yield of two target products by 29% and 63% respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated that the synthetic scaffold could be applied to rewire the metabolic flux. Our system could be a useful tool for metabolic engineering and beyond.",

The need to contain and harvest the gaseous products provides decisive solar bioreactor design advantages by limiting O2 exposure to prolific, but O2-sensitive H2 producing enzymes—[FeFe] hydrogenases. CO2 supply and cell growth can also be limited so that most of the photosynthetic reduction capacity is directed toward H2 production. Yet, natural [FeFe] hydrogenases are still too O2 sensitive for technology implementation. We report the discovery of new variants and a new O2 tolerance mechanism that significantly reduce the sensitivity to O2 exposure without lowering H2 production rates or losing electrons to O2 reduction. Testing the improved hydrogenases with a biologically derived, light-dependent electron source provides evidence that this game changing technology has the potential for sustainable large-scale fuel production.",

     "abstract": "Zerumbone, the predominant sesquiterpenoid component of Zingiber zerumbet, exhibits diverse pharmacological properties. In this study, de novo production of zerumbone was achieved in a metabolically engineered yeast cell factory by introducing α-humulene synthase (ZSS1), α-humulene 8-hydroxylase (CYP71BA1) and zerumbone synthase variant (ZSD1S114A) from Z. zerumbet, together with AtCPR1 from Arabidopsis thaliana into the yeast strain. Multistep metabolic engineering strategies were applied, including the over-expression of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway rate-limiting enzymes tHMG1 and ERG20, regulation of ERG9 by an inducible promoter and competitive pathway deletion to redirect metabolic flux toward the desired product. In the engineered strain, α-humulene production increased by 18-fold, to 92 mg/L compared to that in the original strain. Five cytochrome P450 reductases (CPRs) from different sources were selected for CYP71BA1 adaptability tests, and AtCPR1 from A. thaliana was found to be the optimal, producing 113.16 μg/L of 8-hydroxy-α-humulene. Multicopy integration of CYP71BA1, AtCPR1, ZSS1 and ICE2 (type III membrane protein) genes resulting in strain LW14 increased the production of 8-hydroxy-α-humulene by 134-fold to 15.2 mg/L. Expressing ZSD1S114A in the ura3 site of strain LW14 resulted in the production of 7 mg/L zerumbone. Multicopy integration of ZSD1S114A increased the production of zerumbone to 20.6 mg/L.

     "abstract": "Lignin is a polymer that significantly inhibits saccharification of plant feedstocks. Adjusting the composition or reducing the total lignin content have both been demonstrated to result in an increase in sugar yield from biomass. However, because lignin is essential for plant growth, it cannot be manipulated with impunity. Thus, it is important to understand the control of carbon flux towards lignin biosynthesis such that optimal modifications to it can be made precisely. Phenylalanine (Phe) is the common precursor for all lignin subunits and it is commonly accepted that all biosynthetic steps, spanning multiple subcellular compartments, are known, yet an in vivo model of how flux towards lignin is controlled is lacking. To address this deficiency, we formulated and parameterized a kinetic model based on data from feeding Arabidopsis thaliana basal lignifying stems with ring labeled [13C6]-Phe. Several candidate models were compared by an information theoretic approach to select the one that best matched the experimental observations. Here we present a dynamic model of phenylpropanoid metabolism across several subcellular compartments that describes the allocation of carbon towards lignin biosynthesis in wild-type Arabidopsis stems.

Metabolite profiling of strain MS941 revealed the presence of the C30 carotenoids 4,4′-diapophytofluene and 4,4′-diaponeurosporenic acid. A gene function analysis demonstrated the presence of a corresponding C30 carotenoid biosynthetic pathway with pharmaceutical importance. We identified a gene cluster comprising putative genes for a farnesyl diphosphate synthase (IspA), a diapophytoene synthase (CrtM) and three distinct diapophytoene desaturases (CrtN1–3). Intriguingly, crtM was organized in an operon together with two of the identified crtN genes. The individual activities of the encoded enzymes were determined by heterologous expression and product analysis in the non-carotenogenic model organism Escherichia coli. Our experimental data show that the first catalytic steps of C30 carotenoid biosynthesis in B. megaterium share significant similarity to the corresponding biosynthetic pathway of Staphylococcus aureus. The biosynthesis of farnesyl diphosphates and their subsequent condensation to form 4,4′-diapophytoene are catalyzed by the identified IspA and CrtM, respectively. The following desaturation reactions to form 4,4′-diaponeurosporene, however, require the activities of multiple diapophytoene desaturases. A biosynthetic operon was engineered and successfully expressed in an E. coli whole-cell system creating a cell factory for a high-yield production of the C30 carotenoid 4,4′-diaponeurosporene which has promising potential in the treatment of various inflammatory diseases.",

Rhodococcus opacus is a promising aromatic-catabolizing, oleaginous bacterium, but mechanisms for its aromatic tolerance and utilization remain undercharacterized. To better understand these mechanisms, we adaptively evolved R. opacus for improved utilization of 32 combinations of diverse aromatic compounds. Evolved R. opacus mutants showed up to 1900% growth improvement in the utilization of phenol, guaiacol, 4-hydroxybenzoate, vanillate, and benzoate compared to the wild-type strain. Whole genome sequencing revealed several redox-related genes with mutations shared across multiple adapted mutants. PVHG6, the mutant with the most improved growth on a mixture of multiple aromatic compounds, showed 56% lower superoxide dismutase activity than the wild-type strain, suggesting that redox reactions are important for aromatic tolerance and utilization. Comparative transcriptomics revealed by-product detoxification pathways and five aromatic funneling pathways that were upregulated in response to specific aromatic compounds. Gene knockout experiments confirmed the two degradation routes of the β-ketoadipate pathway for five aromatic compounds. These results provide an improved understanding of aromatic bioconversion and facilitate development of R. opacus as a biorefinery host.",

Using the model strain Synechococcus elongatus, a generic platform was developed for the heterologous production of polyketide synthase (PKS)-derived compounds. The versatility of this system is based on interchangeable modules harboring promiscuous enzymes for PKS activation and the production of PKS extender units, as well as inducible circuits for a regulated expression of the PKS biosynthetic gene cluster. To assess the capability of this platform, we expressed the mycobacterial PKS-based mycocerosic biosynthetic pathway to produce multimethyl-branched esters (MBE).

     "abstract": "Astaxanthin is a reddish keto-carotenoid classified as a xanthophyll found in various microbes and marine organisms. As a powerful antioxidant having up to 100 times more potency than other carotenoids such as β-carotene, lutein, and lycopene, astaxanthin is a versatile compound utilized in animal feed, food pigment, health promotion and cosmetic industry. Here, we report development of metabolically engineered Escherichia coli capable of producing astaxanthin to a high concentration with high productivity. First, the heterologous crt genes (crtE, crtY, crtI, crtB, and crtZ) from Pantoea ananatis and the truncated BKT gene (trCrBKT) from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were introduced to construct the astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway. Then, eight different fusion tags were examined by attaching them to the N- or C-terminus of the trCrBKT membrane protein to allow stable expression and to efficiently guide trCrBKT to the E. coli membrane. When the signal peptide of OmpF and TrxA were tagged to the N-terminus and C-terminus of trCrBKT, respectively, astaxanthin production reached 12.90 mg/L (equivalent to 3.84 mg/gDCW), which was 2.08-fold higher than that obtained without tagging. Upon optimization of culture conditions, this engineered strain WLGB-RPP harboring pAX15 produced 332.23 mg/L (5.38 mg/gDCW) of astaxanthin with the productivity of 3.79 mg/L/h by fed-batch fermentation. In order to further increase astaxanthin production, in silico flux variability scanning based on enforced objective flux (FVSEOF) was performed to identify gene overexpression targets. The engineered strain WLGB-RPP (pAX15, pTrc-ispDF) which simultaneously overexpressing the ispD and ispF genes identified by FVSEOF produced astaxanthin to a higher concentration of 377.10 mg/L (6.26 mg/gDCW) with a productivity of 9.20 mg/L/h upon induction with 1 mM IPTG. When cells were induced with 0.5 mM IPTG to reduce the metabolic burden, astaxanthin concentration further increased to 432.82 mg/L (7.12 mg/gDCW) with a productivity of 9.62 mg/L/h. To more stably maintain plasmid during the fed-batch fermentation of WLGB-RPP (pAX15, pTrc-ispDF), the post-segregational killing hok/sok system was introduced. This strain produced 385.04 mg/L (6.98 mg/gDCW) of astaxanthin with a productivity of 7.86 mg/L/h upon induction with 0.5 mM IPTG. The strategies reported here will be useful for the enhanced production of astaxanthin and related carotenoid products by engineered E. coli strains.",

     "abstract": "Photosynthetic microalgae harbor enormous potential as light-driven green-cell factories for sustainable bio-production of a range of natural and heterologous products such as isoprenoids. Their capacity for photosynthesis and rapid low-input growth with (sun)light and CO2 is coupled to a robust metabolic architecture structured toward the generation of isoprenoid pigments and compounds involved in light capture, electron transfer, and radical scavenging. Metabolic engineering approaches using eukaryotic green microalgae have previously been hampered mainly by low-levels of nuclear transgene expression. Here, we employed a strategy of optimized transgene design which couples codon optimization and synthetic intron spreading for the expression of heterologous plant enzymes from the algal nuclear genome. The diterpenoids casbene, taxadiene, and 13R(+) manoyl oxide were produced after expressing heterologous diterpene synthases and enzymes participating in the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway which were all targeted to the algal chloroplast. Additionally, a truncated and soluble plant microsomal cytochrome P450 monooxygenase was functionally expressed and able to hydroxylate 13R(+) manoyl oxide when directed into the chloroplasts. The heterologous diterpenoids were found to be excreted from the cells and accumulate in dodecane solvent-culture overlays. It was shown that the algal cell could tolerate significant metabolic pull towards diterpenoids without loss of native pigments. Using an algal strain producing 13R(+) manoyl oxide as a model, diterpenoid production was shown to be highest in photoautotrophic cultivations using CO2 as the sole carbon source and day:night illumination cycles. Up to 80 mg 13R(+) manoyl oxide per gram cell dry mass (CDM) could be produced from C. reinhardtii in a 7 day batch cultivation with a sustained maximal productivity of 22.5 mg gcdm−1 d−1 over 3 consecutive days. Collectively the results presented here suggest that green algal cells have remarkable potential for the heterologous production of non-native isoprenoids and support the use of these hosts for (sun)light driven bioproduction concepts.",

Recently, a number of metagenomics studies have illustrated associations between the altered gut microbiota and child malnutrition. However, these studies did not examine metabolic functions and interactions between individual species in the gut microbiota during health and malnutrition. Here, we applied genome-scale metabolic modeling to model the gut microbial species, which were selected from healthy and malnourished children from three countries. Our analysis showed reduced metabolite production capabilities in children from two low-income countries compared with a high-income country. Additionally, the models were also used to predict the community-level metabolic potentials of gut microbes and the patterns of pairwise interactions among species. Hereby we found that due to bacterial interactions there may be reduced production of certain amino acids in malnourished children compared with healthy children from the same communities. To gain insight into alterations in the metabolism of malnourished (stunted) children, we also performed targeted plasma metabolic profiling in the first 2 years of life of 25 healthy and 25 stunted children. Plasma metabolic profiling further revealed that stunted children had reduced plasma levels of essential amino acids compared to healthy controls. Our analyses provide a framework for future efforts towards further characterization of gut microbial metabolic capabilities and their contribution to malnutrition.",

Traditional strategies for increasing the productivity of this microbial cell factory generally focused on the targeted modification of rate-limiting components or steps. However, the longstanding problems of limited productivity of the expression host, metabolic burden and non-optimal nutrient intake, have not yet been completely solved to achieve significant production-strain improvements. To tackle this problem, we systematically rewired the regulatory networks of the global nitrogen and carbon metabolism by random mutagenesis of the pleiotropic transcriptional regulators CodY and CcpA, to allow for optimal nutrient intake, translating into significantly higher heterologous protein production yields. Using a β-galactosidase expression and screening system and consecutive rounds of mutagenesis, we identified mutant variants of both CodY and CcpA that in conjunction increased production levels up to 290%. RNA-Seq and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that amino acid substitutions within the DNA-binding domains altered the overall binding specificity and regulatory activity of the two transcription factors. Consequently, fine-tuning of the central metabolic pathways allowed for enhanced protein production levels. The improved cell factory capacity was further demonstrated by the successfully increased overexpression of GFP, xylanase and a peptidase in the double mutant strain.",

     "abstract": "Engineering a microbial strain for production sometimes entails metabolic modifications that impair essential physiological processes for growth or production. Restoring these functions may require amending a variety of non-obvious physiological networks, and thus, rational design strategies may not be practical. Here we demonstrate that growth and production may be restored by evolution that repairs impaired metabolic function. Furthermore, we use genomics, metabolomics and proteomics to identify several underlying mutations and metabolic perturbations that allow metabolism to repair. Previously, high titers of butanol production were achieved by Escherichia coli using a growth-coupled, modified Clostridial CoA-dependent pathway after all native fermentative pathways were deleted. However, production was only observed in rich media. Native metabolic function of the host was unable to support growth and production in minimal media. We use directed cell evolution to repair this phenotype and observed improved growth, titers and butanol yields. We found a mutation in pcnB which resulted in decreased plasmid copy numbers and pathway enzymes to balance resource utilization. Increased protein abundance was measured for biosynthetic pathways, glycolytic enzymes have increased activity, and adenosyl energy charge was increased. We also found mutations in the ArcAB two-component system and integration host factor (IHF) that tune redox metabolism to alter byproduct formation. These results demonstrate that directed strain evolution can enable systematic adaptations to repair metabolic function and enhance microbial production. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the versatile repair capabilities of cell metabolism and highlight important aspects of cell physiology that are required for production in minimal media.",

Results showed that the enzymes Ipi, Dxs and IspD had the biggest impact on isoprene production.

A genome-scale model was used to identify targets upstream of the MEP pathway that could redirect flux towards terpenoids. A total of ten reactions from the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, lower glycolysis and co-factor synthesis pathways were probed for their effect on isoprene synthesis by co-expressing them with the MEP enzymes, resulting in a 60% increase in production from the best strain. Lastly, we studied two isoprene synthases with the highest reported catalytic rates.

Systems biology approaches can aid in identifying genetic targets for modification through providing an integrated view of cellular physiology. Recently, research into the generation of commercial yeasts that can produce reduced-ethanol wines has resulted in metabolically-engineered strains of S. cerevisiae that are less efficient at producing ethanol from sugar. However, these modifications led to the concomitant production of off-flavour by-products. A combination of transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics was therefore used to investigate the physiological changes occurring in an engineered low-ethanol yeast strain during alcoholic fermentation. Integration of ‘omics data identified several metabolic reactions, including those related to the pyruvate node and redox homeostasis, as being significantly affected by the low-ethanol engineering methodology, and highlighted acetaldehyde and 2,4,5-trimethyl-1,3-dioxolane as the main off-flavour compounds. Gene remediation strategies were then successfully applied to decrease the formation of these by-products, while maintaining the ‘low-alcohol’ phenotype. The data generated from this comprehensive systems-based study will inform wine yeast strain development programmes, which, in turn, could potentially play an important role in assisting winemakers in their endeavour to produce low-alcohol wines with desirable flavour profiles.",

The consumption of fossil fuels is still increasing, resulting in a continued search for more sustainable methods to renew our supply of liquid fuel. Photosynthetic microorganisms naturally accumulate hydrocarbons that could serve as a replacement for fossil fuel, however productivities remain low. We report successful introduction of five synthetic metabolic pathways in two green cell factories, prokaryotic cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae. Heterologous thioesterase expression enabled high-yield conversion of native fatty acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) into free fatty acids (FFA) in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 but not in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii where the polar lipid fraction instead was enhanced. Despite no increase in measurable FFA in Chlamydomonas, genetic recoding and over-production of the native fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP) resulted in increased accumulation of 7-heptadecene. Implementation of a carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO) dependent synthetic pathway in Synechocystis resulted in the accumulation of fatty alcohols and a decrease in the native saturated alkanes. In contrast, the replacement of CAR and ADO with Pseudomonas mendocina UndB (so named as it is responsible for 1-undecene biosynthesis in Pseudomonas) or Chlorella variabilis FAP resulted in high-yield conversion of thioesterase-liberated FFAs into corresponding alkenes and alkanes, respectively. At best, the engineering resulted in an increase in hydrocarbon accumulation of 8- (from 1 to 8.5 mg/g cell dry weight) and 19-fold (from 4 to 77 mg/g cell dry weight) for Chlamydomonas and Synechocystis, respectively. In conclusion, reconstitution of the eukaryotic algae pathway in the prokaryotic cyanobacteria host generated the most effective system, highlighting opportunities for mix-and-match synthetic metabolism.

N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is a typical nutraceutical and has many applications in the field of healthcare. Here, we have developed a gene repressor system based on xylose-induced CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) in Bacillus subtilis, aimed at downregulating the expression of three genes (zwf, pfkA, glmM) that control the major competing reactions of GlcNAc synthesis (pentose phosphate pathway (HMP), glycolysis, and peptidoglycan synthesis pathway (PSP)), with the potential to relieve glucose repression and allow the co-utilization of both glucose and xylose. Simultaneous repression of these three genes by CRISPRi improved GlcNAc titer by 13.2% to 17.4 ± 0.47 g/L, with the GlcNAc yield on glucose and xylose showing an 84.1% improvement, reaching 0.42 ± 0.036 g/g. In order to further engineer the synergetic utilization of glucose and xylose, a combinatorial approach was developed based on 27 arrays containing sgRNAs with different repression capacities targeting the three genes. We further optimized the temporal control of the system and found that when 15 g/L xylose was added 6 h after inoculation, the most efficient strain, BNX122, synthesized 20.5 ± 0.85 g/L GlcNAc with a yield of 0.46 ± 0.010 g/g glucose and xylose in shake flask culture. Finally, the GlcNAc titer and productivity in a 3-L fed-batch bioreactor reached 103.1 ± 2.11 g/L and 1.17 ± 0.024 g/L/h, which were 5.0-fold and 2.7-fold of that in shake flask culture, respectively.

To date, all 13C-MFA studies on microbes have been performed with cells grown in liquid culture. Here, we extend the scope of 13C-MFA to biological systems where cells are grown in dense microbial colonies. First, we identified new optimal 13C tracers to quantify fluxes in systems where the acetate yield cannot be easily measured. We determined that three parallel labeling experiments with the tracers [1,2–13C]glucose, [1,6–13C]glucose, and [4,5,6–13C]glucose permit precise estimation of not only intracellular fluxes, but also of the amount of acetate produced from glucose. Parallel labeling experiments were then performed with wild-type E. coli and E. coli ΔackA grown in liquid culture and on agar plates. Initial attempts to fit the labeling data from wild-type E. coli grown on agar did not produce a statistically acceptable fit. To resolve this issue, we employed the recently developed co-culture 13C-MFA approach, where two E. coli subpopulations were defined in the model that engaged in metabolite cross-feeding. The flux results identified two distinct E. coli cell populations, a dominant cell population (92% of cells) that metabolized glucose via conventional metabolic pathways and secreted a large amount of acetate (~40% of maximum theoretical yield), and a second smaller cell population (8% of cells) that consumed the secreted acetate without any glucose influx. These experimental results are in good agreement with recent theoretical simulations. Importantly, this study provides a solid foundation for future investigations of a wide range of problems involving microbial biofilms that are of great interest in biotechnology, ecology and medicine, where metabolite cross-feeding between cell populations is a core feature of the communities.",

     "abstract": "Uridine is a kind of pyrimidine nucleoside that has been widely applied in the pharmaceutical industry. Although microbial fermentation is a promising method for industrial production of uridine, an efficient microbial cell factory is still lacking. In this study, we constructed a metabolically engineered Escherichia coli capable of high-yield uridine production. First, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated chromosomal integration strategy to integrate large DNA into the E. coli chromosome, and a 9.7 kb DNA fragment including eight genes in the pyrimidine operon of Bacillus subtilis F126 was integrated into the yghX locus of E. coli W3110. The resultant strain produced 3.3 g/L uridine and 4.5 g/L uracil in shake flask culture for 32 h. Subsequently, five genes involved in uridine catabolism were knocked out, and the uridine titer increased to 7.8 g/L. As carbamyl phosphate, aspartate, and 5′-phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate are important precursors for uridine synthesis, we further modified several metabolism-related genes and synergistically improved the supply of these precursors, leading to a 76.9% increase in uridine production. Finally, nupC and nupG encoding nucleoside transport proteins were deleted, and the extracellular uridine accumulation increased to 14.5 g/L. After 64 h of fed-batch fermentation, the final engineered strain UR6 produced 70.3 g/L uridine with a yield and productivity of 0.259 g/g glucose and 1.1 g/L/h, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest uridine titer and productivity ever reported for the fermentative production of uridine.",

To move towards utilizing methanol as a sole carbon source, here we engineer an Escherichia coli strain to couple methanol utilization with growth on five-carbon (C5) sugars. By deleting essential genes in the pentose phosphate pathway for pentose utilization and expressing heterologous enzymes from the ribulose-monophosphate (RuMP) pathway, we constructed a strain that cannot grow on xylose or ribose minimal media unless methanol is utilized, creating a phenotype termed “synthetic methanol auxotrophy”. Our best strains were able to utilize methanol for growth at a rate of 0.17 ± 0.006 (h−1) with methanol and xylose co-assimilation at a molar ratio of approximately 1:1. Genome sequencing and reversion of mutations indicated that mutations on genes encoding for adenylate cyclase (cyaA) and the formaldehyde detoxification operon (frmRAB) were necessary for the growth phenotype. The methanol auxotrophic strain was further engineered to produce ethanol or 1-butanol to final titers of 4.6 g/L and 2.0 g/L, respectively. 13C tracing showed that 43% and 71% of ethanol and 1-butanol produced had labeled carbon derived from methanol, respectively.",

Spermidine is a common polyamine that plays a role in stabilizing chromatin, DNA replication, transcription, translation, as well as the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis in eukaryotes. Amines are also associated with defense to a number of environmental stresses including elevated temperature and have been shown to be involved in tolerance to fermentation inhibitors such as furan derivatives and acetic acid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. While the tolerance and detoxifying mechanisms have been intensively studied, metabolic engineering efforts to construct tolerant and resistant strains have been few. Here we show that exogenously added spermidine confers enhanced tolerance to furans and acetic acid in the Gram-positive bacterium, Clostridium thermocellum. Deletion of the endogenous spermidine synthase resulted in a severe growth defect and hypersensitivity to both furans and acetic acid. Exogenously added spermidine rescued all three phenotypes. Overexpression of the endogenous spermidine synthase resulted in increased tolerance to these compounds without added spermidine. Increased tolerance to these fermentation inhibitors will facilitate the use of C. thermocellum, one of the most cellulolytic of all known bacterial species, for the production of fuels from plant biomass substrates.",

However, little is known about the mechanism behind PHA accumulation under oxygen limitation. This study for the first time found that H. bluephagenesis utilizes NADH instead of NADPH as a cofactor for PHB production, thus revealing the rare situation of enhanced PHA accumulation under oxygen limitation. To increase NADH/NAD+ ratio for enhanced PHA accumulation under oxygen limitation, an electron transport pathway containing electron transfer flavoprotein subunits α and β encoded by etf operon was blocked to increase NADH supply, leading to 90% PHB accumulation in the cell dry weight (CDW) of H. bluephagenesis compared with 84% by the wild type. Acetic acid, a cost-effective carbon source, was used together with glucose to balance the redox state and reduce inhibition on pyruvate metabolism, resulting in 22% more CDW and 94% PHB accumulation. The cellular redox state changes induced by the addition of acetic acid increased 3HV ratio in its copolymer PHBV from 4% to 8%, 4HB in its copolymer P34HB from 8% to 12%, respectively, by engineered H. bluephagenesis. The strategy of systematically modulation on the redox potential of H. bluephagenesis led to enhanced PHA accumulation and controllable monomer ratios in PHA copolymers under oxygen limitation, reducing energy consumption and scale-up complexity.",

In this study, we initially developed a pathway for the synthesis of 4-HIL in an L-isoleucine producer, C. glutamicum YI, but insufficient supply of α-ketoglutarate was a bottleneck for a strong production. Six genes involved in oxaloacetate and α-ketoglutarate branches were overexpressed or deleted, which increased the production of 4-HIL to 5.12 g/L but a considerable amount of L-isoleucine still accumulated in the culture. We then dynamically modulated the activity of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (ODHC) by employing L-isoleucine-responsive transcription or attenuation strategies. The best-engineered strain, HIL18, produced 34.21 g/L 4-HIL with a negligible accumulation of byproducts, including approximately 0.6 g/L L-isoleucine.

The strategy was applied to improve the production of a macrocyclic peptide, bottromycin, which possesses antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria and is a blueprint for a new class of antibacterials. We successfully optimized the expression of genes in operons and created several variants of the bottromycin gene cluster that provide 5–50 fold higher titres of bottromycin than the natural one, thus resulting in the identification of several new bottromycin derivatives not previously described. Moreover, due to the higher bottromycin yield, bottromycin derivatization was performed via the biosynthetic engineering of the gene cluster.

In this study we have harnessed evolution to create faster growing mutants of Corynebacterium glutamicum, i.e. to debottleneck growth rate of this highly important industrial workhorse. After approximately 1500 generations of Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE) in defined minimal medium with glucose, we obtained faster growing mutants with specific growth rate as high as 0.64 h−1 as compared with 0.45 h−1 for the wild type, and this 42% improvement is the highest reported for C. glutamicum to date. By genome resequencing and inverse metabolic engineering, we were able to pinpoint two mutations contributing to most of the growth improvement, and these resided in the transcriptional regulators GntR1 (gntR1-E70K) and RamA (ramA-A52V). We confirmed that the two mutations lead to alteration rather than elimination of function, and their introduction in the wild-type background resulted in a specific growth rate of 0.62 h−1. The glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway fluxes had both increased significantly, and a transcriptomic analyses supported this to be associated with increased capacity. Interestingly, the observed fast growth phenotype was not restricted to glucose but was also observed on fructose, sucrose and xylose, however, the effect of the mutations could only be seen in minimal medium, and not rich BHI medium, where growth was already fast. We also found that the mutations could improve the performance of resting cells, under oxygen-deprived conditions, where an increase in sugar consumption rate of around 30% could be achieved. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to reprogram C. glutamicum into growing faster and thus enhance its industrial potential.",

Optimizing multigene pathways stepwise or by randomly selecting enzymes and expression levels is inefficient. Here, we apply methods from design of experiments (DOE) to guide the construction of strain libraries from which the maximum information can be extracted without sampling every possible combination. We use Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a host for a novel six-gene pathway to itaconic acid, selected by comparing alternative shunt pathways that bypass the mitochondrial TCA cycle. The pathway is distinctive for the use of acetylating acetaldehyde dehydrogenase to increase cytosolic acetyl-CoA pools, a bacterial enzyme to synthesize citrate in the cytosol, and an itaconic acid exporter. Precise control over the expression of each gene is enabled by a set of promoter-terminator pairs that span a 174-fold range. Two large combinatorial libraries (160 variants, 2.4 Mb and 32 variants, 0.6 Mb) are designed where the expression levels are selected by statistical methods (I-optimal response surface methodology, full factorial, or Plackett-Burman) with the intent of extracting different types of guiding information after the screen. This is applied to the design of a third library (24 variants, 0.5 Mb) intended to alleviate a bottleneck in cis-aconitate decarboxylase (CAD) expression. The top strain produces 815 mg/l itaconic acid, a 4-fold improvement over the initial strain achieved by iteratively balancing pathway expression. Including a methylated product in the total, the strain produces 1.3 g/l combined itaconic acids. Further, a regression analysis of the libraries reveals the optimal expression level of CAD as well as pairwise interdependencies between genes that result in increased titer and purity of itaconic acid.

Distinct guide RNA (gRNA) targets flanking the REs for each gene then allow to specifically delete the RE by CRISPR/Cas9 and thus to activate the expression of the corresponding gene(s).

The knocked-in β-glucosidase BglC from Thermobifida fusca catalyzed intracellular cleavage of the disaccharide to D-glucose, which was then channelled to the default central metabolism. Xylose oxidation to the dead end product D-xylonate was prevented by deleting the gcd gene that encodes the broad substrate range quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase. Intracellular intake was then engineered by expressing the Escherichia coli proton-coupled symporter XylE. The sugar was further metabolized by the products of E. coli xylA (xylose isomerase) and xylB (xylulokinase) towards the pentose phosphate pathway. The resulting P. putida strain co-utilized xylose with glucose or cellobiose to complete depletion of the sugars. These results not only show the broadening of the metabolic capacity of a soil bacterium towards new substrates, but also promote P. putida EM42 as a platform for plug-in of new biochemical pathways for utilization and valorization of carbohydrate mixtures from lignocellulose processing.",

     "abstract": "Succinate is a versatile petrochemical compound that can be produced by microorganisms, often from carbohydrate based carbon sources. Phototrophic cyanobacteria including Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 can more efficiently produce organic acids such as succinate without sugar supplementation, via photosynthetic production of glycogen followed by glycogen utilization, typically under dark conditions. In this study, Synechocystis 6803 bioproduction of organic acids under dark anoxic conditions was found to increase with elevation of temperature from 30 °C to 37 °C. The further enhancement of succinate bioproduction by overexpression of the rate limiting enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase resulted in improved glycogen utilization. To gain more insight into the mechanisms underlying the increased organic acid output, a novel temperature dependent metabolomics analysis was performed. Adenylate energy charge was found to decrease along with elevating temperature, while central metabolites glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, glycerol 3-phosphate, malate, fumarate and succinate increased. Temperature dependent 13C-labeling metabolomics analysis further revealed a glycolysis to TCA bottleneck, which could be overcome by addition of CO2, leading to even higher organic acid production. Optimization of initial cell concentration to 25 g-dry cell weight/L, in combination with 100 mM NaHCO3 supplementation, afforded a succinate titer of over 1.8 g/L, the highest reported autotrophic succinate titer. Succinate titers remained high after additional knockout of ackA, resulting in the highest reported autotrophic D-lactate titer as well. The optimization of Synechocystis 6803 organic acid production therefore holds significant promise for CO2 capture and utilization.",

Moreover, varying the expression level of infA enabled us to rationally tune the PCN by more than 5.6-fold.

Whereas, elaborate systems biology approaches have been recently explored, mixed-substrate utilisation is predominantly ignored despite its significance in enhancing bioprocess performance. Herein, bioprocess optimisation for an industrially-relevant bioremediation process involving a mixture of highly toxic substrates, m-xylene and toluene, was achieved through application of a novel experimental-modelling gene regulatory network – growth kinetic (GRN-GK) hybrid framework. The GRN model described the TOL and ortho-cleavage pathways in Pseudomonas putida mt-2 and captured the transcriptional kinetics expression patterns of the promoters. The GRN model informed the formulation of the growth kinetics model replacing the empirical and unstructured Monod kinetics. The GRN-GK framework's predictive capability and potential as a systematic optimal bioprocess design tool, was demonstrated by effectively predicting bioprocess performance, which was in agreement with experimental values, when compared to four commonly used models that deviated significantly from the experimental values. Significantly, a fed-batch biodegradation process was designed and optimised through the model-based control of TOL Pr promoter expression resulting in 61% and 60% enhanced pollutant removal and biomass formation, respectively, compared to the batch process. This provides strong evidence of model-based bioprocess optimisation at the gene level, rendering the GRN-GK framework as a novel and applicable approach to optimal bioprocess design. Finally, model analysis using global sensitivity analysis (GSA) suggests an alternative, systematic approach for model-driven strain modification for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering applications.",

In this study, we demonstrate the combined use of integrated genomic and transcriptomic analysis of the genetic basis for riboflavin over-production in B. subtilis. This methodology succeeded in discerning the positive mutations in the mutagenesis derived riboflavin producer B. subtilis 24/pMX45 through whole-genome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing. These included RibC (G199D), ribD+(G+39A), PurA (P242L), CcpN(A44S), YvrH (R222Q) and two nonsense mutations YhcF (R90*) and YwaA (Q68*). Reintroducing these specific mutations into the wild-type strain recovered the riboflavin overproduction phenotype and subsequent metabolic engineering greatly improved riboflavin production, achieving an up to 3.4-fold increase of the riboflavin titer over the sequenced producer. A novel mutation, YvrH (R222Q), involved in a typical two-component regulatory system deregulated the purine de novo synthesis pathway and increased the pool of intracellular purine metabolites, which in turn increased riboflavin production. Taken together, we present a case study of combining genome and transcriptome analysis to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of a complex cellular property, which enabled the transfer of beneficial mutations to engineer a reference strain into an overproducer.",

Here, we used our recently developed flower petal transformation method in the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus to shed light on the complex regulatory mechanisms steering the jasmonate-modulated biosynthesis of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs), to which the anti-cancer compounds vinblastine and vincristine belong. By combinatorial overexpression of the transcriptional activators BIS1, ORCA3 and MYC2a, we provide an unprecedented insight into the modular transcriptional control of MIA biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that the expression of an engineered de-repressed MYC2a triggers a tremendous reprogramming of the MIA pathway, finally leading to massively increased accumulation of at least 23 MIAs. The current study unveils an innovative approach for future metabolic engineering efforts for the production of valuable bioactive plant compounds in non-model plants.",

However, the limited genetic tools currently restrict its further research and application efforts using synthetic biology approaches. In this study, a series of genetic tools were systematically developed and optimized for Synechococcus 2973. First, the introduction of Tfp pilus assembly protein encoding gene pilN into Synechococcus 2973 successfully recovered its natural transformability, which greatly simplified the DNA transformation process. Second, a series of promoters with different strengths were evaluated and the super-strong promoters including Pcpc560 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, native PpsbA2 and PpsbA3 of Synechococcus 2973 were found with the highest activity of β-galactosidase among those evaluated by miller values. Some promoters related to photosystems (i.e., PpsbA2, PpsbA3, P6803psbA2 and Pcpc560) were also demonstrated to be induced by high intensity of light. Third, three lactose induction systems were evaluated, among which Plac combined with lacIq showed the best application prospect with great induction capacity, low leakage and middle induced expression. Fourth, the translational on riboswitch theoE* , the transcriptional off riboswitches theo/yitJ and xpt(C74U)/metE and an artificial inducing system combining theoE* with T7 RNA polymerase were successfully developed and characterized in Synechococcus 2973.

The conversion of methane to industrial platform chemicals provides an attractive opportunity to decrease GHG emissions and utilize this inexpensive and abundantly available gas as a carbon feedstock. While technologies exist for chemical conversion of methane to liquid fuels, the technical complexity of these processes mandate high capital expenditure, large-scale commercial facilities to leverage economies of scale that cannot be efficiently scaled down. Alternatively, bioconversion technologies capable of efficient small-scale operation with high carbon and energy efficiency can enable deployment at remote methane resources inaccessible to current chemical technologies. Aerobic obligate methanotrophs, specifically Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1, have recently garnered increased research interest for development of such bio-technologies. In this study, we demonstrate production of C-4 carboxylic acids non-native to the host, specifically crotonic and butyric acids, from methane in an engineered M. buryatense 5GB1C by diversion of carbon flux through the acetyl-CoA node of central ‘sugar’ linked metabolic pathways using reverse β-oxidation pathway genes. The synthesis of short chain carboxylic acids through the acetyl-CoA node demonstrates the potential for engineering M. buryatense 5GB1 as a platform for bioconversion of methane to a number of value added industrial chemicals, and presents new opportunities for further diversifying the products obtainable from methane as the feedstock.",

Yarrowia lipolytica is one of the best characterized of these yeast with respect to genome annotation and flux analysis of metabolic processes.

In order to remedy this deficiency, we developed a library of Y. lipolytica insertion mutants via transposon mutagenesis. The Hermes DNA transposon was expressed to achieve saturation mutagenesis of the genome. Over 534,000 independent insertions were identified by next-generation sequencing. Poisson analysis of insertion density classified ~ 22% of genes as essential. As expected, most essential genes have homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and the majority of those are also essential. As an obligate aerobe, Y. lipolytica has significantly more respiration - related genes that are classified as essential than do S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. Contributions of non-essential genes to growth in glucose and glycerol carbon sources were assessed and used to evaluate two recent genome-scale models of Y. lipolytica metabolism. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting identified mutants in which lipid accumulation is increased. Our findings provide insights into biosynthetic pathways, compartmentalization of enzymes, and distinct functions of paralogs. This functional genomic analysis of the oleaginous yeast Y. lipolytica provides an important resource for modeling, bioengineering, and design of synthetic minimalized strains of respiratory yeasts.",

     "abstract": "Ethylene glycol is used as a raw material in the production of polyethylene terephthalate, in antifreeze, as a gas hydrate inhibitor in pipelines, and for many other industrial applications. It is metabolized by aerobic microbial processes via the highly toxic intermediates glycolaldehyde and glycolate through C2 metabolic pathways. Pseudomonas putida KT2440, which has been engineered for environmental remediation applications given its high toxicity tolerance and broad substrate specificity, is not able to efficiently metabolize ethylene glycol, despite harboring putative genes for this purpose. To further expand the metabolic portfolio of P. putida, we elucidated the metabolic pathway to enable ethylene glycol via systematic overexpression of glyoxylate carboligase (gcl) in combination with other genes. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that all of the four genes in genomic proximity to gcl (hyi, glxR, ttuD, and pykF) are transcribed as an operon. Where the expression of only two genes (gcl and glxR) resulted in growth in ethylene glycol, improved growth and ethylene glycol utilization were observed when the entire gcl operon was expressed. Both glycolaldehyde and glyoxal inhibit growth in concentrations of ethylene glycol above 50 mM. To overcome this bottleneck, the additional overexpression of the glycolate oxidase (glcDEF) operon removes the glycolate bottleneck and minimizes the production of these toxic intermediates, permitting growth in up to 2 M (~124 g/L) and complete consumption of 0.5 M (31 g/L) ethylene glycol in shake flask experiments. In addition, the engineered strain enables conversion of ethylene glycol to medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHAs). Overall, this study provides a robust P. putida KT2440 strain for ethylene glycol consumption, which will serve as a foundational strain for further biocatalyst development for applications in the remediation of waste polyester plastics and biomass-derived wastewater streams.",

     "abstract": "Dicarboxylic acids, such as the phthalic acids and their derivatives, are monomeric components in several important polyesters and polyamides. In most cases, these compounds are derived from fossil fuels and are not easily biodegradable. Dipicolinic acid (DPA) is a biologically derived aromatic di-acid that has a similar structure to isophthalic acid. Furthermore, DPA has been shown to give rise to polyesters, is readily biodegradable, and is non-toxic. DPA is naturally produced by Bacillus and Clostridium species during sporulation and can comprise up to 15% of the dry weight of bacterial spores. In this paper we demonstrate the first heterologous production of DPA and identify the genes appropriate for gram-scale production in the industrial workhorse organism, E. coli. Initially, several combinations of genes from the lysine pathway, including lysC, asd, dapA, and dapB, were overexpressed to determine which genes are necessary for recombinant production in E. coli. The in vitro activity of dipicolinate synthase was then compared between Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium perfringens. Next, in order to improve DPA production from glucose, an optimized strain was created that lacked several genes (lysA, tdh, and metA), resulting in 5.21 g/L DPA when 5 g/L of aspartate was supplied. Then, several aspartate kinases and dipicolinate synthases were screened for optimal activity in E. coli. The optimal genes were combined with the overexpression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase to develop a full biosynthetic pathway capable of producing a titer of 4.7 g/L DPA directly from glucose. In summary, we have performed a detailed biochemical study of the key pathway enzyme dipicolinate synthase and achieved scalable heterogeneous production of DPA in the workhorse organism E. coli.",

In plants, high-level production of secondary metabolites, such as anthocyanins, can be achieved by engineering of regulatory genes as well as genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes. We have used tobacco lines which constitutively produce high levels of cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside, delphinidin 3-O-rutinoside or a novel anthocyanin, acylated cyanidin 3-O-(coumaroyl) rutinoside to generate cell suspension cultures. The cell lines are stable in their production rates and superior to conventional plant cell cultures. Scale-up of anthocyanin production in small scale fermenters has been demonstrated. The cell cultures have also proven to be a suitable system for production of 13C-labelled anthocyanins. Our method for anthocyanin production is transferable to other plant species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, demonstrating the potential of this approach for making a wide range of highly-decorated anthocyanins. The tobacco cell cultures represent a customisable and sustainable alternative to conventional anthocyanin production platforms and have considerable potential for use in industrial and medical applications of anthocyanins.",

To overcome this obstacle, here we developed an inducible CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system for C. ljungdahlii that enables efficient (> 94%) transcriptional repression of several target genes, both individually and in tandem.

However, acetate production still accounted for 40% of the carbon flux. Repression of aldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (aor2), another potential route for acetate production, led to a 5% reduction in acetate flux, whereas using an additional sgRNA targeted to pta reduced the enzyme activity to 0.7% of the wild-type level, and further reduced acetate production to 25% of the carbon flux with an accompanying increase in 3HB titer and yield.

By using integrated transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolite profiling, together with genetic complementation, we here show that most of these effects could be traced to the inability of the pirA-defective strain to modulate beta-oxidation pathway, leading to an unbalanced supply of precursor monomers for polyketide biosynthesis.

However, engineering principles for α-1,3-fucosyltransferases (1,3-FTs) are not well-known, resulting in the lower productivity of 3-FL than that of 2′-fucosyllactose (2′-FL), although both 2′-FL and 3-FL follow a common pathway to produce GDP-L-fucose. The C-terminus of 1,3-FTs is composed of heptad repeats, responsible for dimerization of the enzymes, and a peripheral membrane anchoring region. It has long been thought that truncation of most heptad repeats, retaining just 1 or 2, helps the soluble expression of 1,3-FTs. However, whether the introduction of truncated version of 1,3-FTs enhances the production of 3-FL in a metabolically engineered strain, is yet to be tested. In this study, the effect of these structural components on the production of 3-FL in Escherichia coli was evaluated through systematic truncation and elongation of the C-terminal regions of three 1,3-FTs from Helicobacter pylori. Although these three 1,3-FTs contained heptad repeats and membrane-anchoring regions of varying lengths, they commonly exhibited an optimal performance when the number of heptad repeats was increased, and membrane-binding region was removed. The production of 3-FL could be increased 10–20-fold through this simple strategy.",

As the precursor for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is effective in treating a variety of diseases, such as depression, fibromyalgia, obesity, and cerebellar ataxia. Due to the lack of an efficient synthetic method, commercial production of 5-HTP is only achieved by extracting from the seeds of Griffonia Smplicifolia. This study reports efficient microbial production of 5-HTP via metabolically engineered Escherichia coli. Firstly, human tryptophan hydroxylase I (TPH1) gene was functionally expressed. For endogenous supply of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), human BH4 biosynthesis and regeneration pathway was reconstituted. Whole-cell bioconversion resulted in high-level production of 5-HTP (~1.2 g/L) from 2 g/L L-tryptophan in shake flasks. Further metabolic engineering efforts were employed to achieve 5-HTP biosynthesis from simple carbon sources. The whole biosynthetic pathway was divided into three functional modules, L-tryptophan module, the hydroxylation module, and the BH4 module. By reducing the copy number of L-tryptophan module, replacing TPH1 with a more stable mutant form, and promoter regulation of the BH4 module, 5-HTP was produced at a final titer of 1.3 g/L in the shake flask and 5.1 g/L in a fed-batch fermenter with glycerol as the carbon source, both of which were the highest ever reported for microbial production of 5-HTP.",

     "abstract": "Evolutionary approaches are often undirected and mutagen-based yielding numerous mutations, which need elaborate screenings to identify relevant targets. We here apply Metabolic engineering to Guide Evolution (MGE), an evolutionary approach evolving and identifying new targets to improve microbial producer strains. MGE is based on the idea to impair the cell's metabolism by metabolic engineering, thereby generating guided evolutionary pressure. It consists of three distinct phases: (i) metabolic engineering to create the evolutionary pressure on the applied strain followed by (ii) a cultivation phase with growth as straightforward screening indicator for the evolutionary event, and (iii) comparative whole genome sequencing (WGS), to identify mutations in the evolved strains, which are eventually re-engineered for verification. Applying MGE, we evolved the PEP and pyruvate carboxylase-deficient strain C. glutamicum Δppc Δpyc to grow on glucose as substrate with rates up to 0.31 ± 0.02 h−1 which corresponds to 80% of the growth rate of the wildtype strain. The intersection of the mutations identified by WGS revealed isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD) as consistent target in three independently evolved mutants. Upon re-engineering in C. glutamicum Δppc Δpyc, the identified mutations led to diminished ICD activities and activated the glyoxylate shunt replenishing oxaloacetate required for growth. Intracellular relative quantitative metabolome analysis showed that the pools of citrate, isocitrate, cis-aconitate, and L-valine were significantly higher compared to the WT control. As an alternative to existing L-valine producer strains based on inactivated or attenuated pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, we finally engineered the PEP and pyruvate carboxylase-deficient C. glutamicum strains with identified ICD mutations for L-valine production by overexpression of the L-valine biosynthesis genes. Among them, C. glutamicum Δppc Δpyc ICDG407S (pJC4ilvBNCE) produced up to 8.9 ± 0.4 g L-valine L−1, with a product yield of 0.22 ± 0.01 g L-valine per g glucose.",

In the present study, we used protein engineering of Kivd to improve isobutanol production in Synechocystis PCC 6803. Isobutanol is a flammable compound that can be used as a biofuel due to its high energy density and suitable physical and chemical properties.

Since most prokaryotes harbor native CRISPR-Cas systems, genome engineering can be achieved by harnessing these endogenous immune systems. Here, we report the exploitation of Type I-B CRISPR-Cas of Clostridium tyrobutyricum for genome engineering. In silico CRISPR array analysis and plasmid interference assay revealed that TCA or TCG at the 5′-end of the protospacer was the functional protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) for CRISPR targeting. With a lactose inducible promoter for CRISPR array expression, we significantly decreased the toxicity of CRISPR-Cas and enhanced the transformation efficiency, and successfully deleted spo0A with an editing efficiency of 100%. We further evaluated effects of the spacer length on genome editing efficiency. Interestingly, spacers ≤ 20 nt led to unsuccessful transformation consistently, likely due to severe off-target effects; while a spacer of 30–38 nt is most appropriate to ensure successful transformation and high genome editing efficiency. Moreover, multiplex genome editing for the deletion of spo0A and pyrF was achieved in a single transformation, with an editing efficiency of up to 100%. Finally, with the integration of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (adhE1 or adhE2) to replace cat1 (the key gene responsible for butyrate production and previously could not be deleted), two mutants were created for n-butanol production, with the butanol titer reached historically record high of 26.2 g/L in a batch fermentation. Altogether, our results demonstrated the easy programmability and high efficiency of endogenous CRISPR-Cas. The developed protocol herein has a broader applicability to other prokaryotes containing endogenous CRISPR-Cas systems.

In this work, we develop an experimental platform to study IPP toxicity in isoprenol-producing Escherichia coli.

We show that IPP toxicity selects for pathway “breakage”, using proteomics to identify a reduction in phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK) as a probable recovery mechanism. Next, using multi-omics data, we demonstrate that endogenous E. coli metabolism is globally impacted by IPP accumulation, which slows nutrient uptake, decreases ATP levels, and perturbs nucleotide metabolism. We also observe the extracellular accumulation of IPP and present preliminary evidence that IPP can be transported by E. coli, findings that might be broadly relevant for the study of isoprenoid biosynthesis. Finally, we discover that IPP accumulation leads to the formation of ApppI, a nucleotide analog of IPP that may contribute to observed toxicity phenotypes. This comprehensive assessment of IPP stress suggests potential strategies for the alleviation of prenyl diphosphate toxicity and highlights possible engineering targets for improved IPP flux and high titer isoprenoid production.",

Here we discover, through multiple evolved lineages, genetic determinants underlying glycerol catabolism and the associated fitness trade-offs. Most evolved lineages adapted through mutations in the HOG pathway, but showed hampered osmotolerance. In the other lineages, we find that only three mutations cause the improved phenotype. One of these contributes counter-intuitively by decoupling the TCA cycle from oxidative phosphorylation, and thereby hampers ethanol utilization. Transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis of the re-engineered strains affirmed the causality of the three mutations at molecular level.

The endogenous farnesyl pyrosphosphate synthase (FPPS; Erg20p) competes with MTSs for the precursor geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), which limits the production of monoterpenes. ERG20 is an essential gene that cannot be deleted and transcriptional down-regulation of ERG20 has failed to improve monoterpene production. Here, we investigated an N-degron-dependent protein degradation strategy to down-regulate Erg20p activity. Degron tagging decreased GFP protein half-life drastically to 1 h (degron K3K15) or 15 min (degrons KN113 and KN119). Degron tagging of ERG20 was therefore paired with a sterol responsive promoter to ensure sufficient metabolic flux to essential downstream sterols despite the severe destabilisation effect of degron tagging. A dual monoterpene/sesquiterpene (linalool/nerolidol) synthase, AcNES1, was used as a reporter of intracellular GPP and FPP production. Transcription of the synthetic pathway was controlled by either constitutive or diauxie-inducible promoters. A combination of degron K3K15 and the ERG1 promoter increased linalool titre by 27-fold to 11 mg L−1 in the strain with constitutive promoter constructs, and by 17-fold to 18 mg L−1 in the strain with diauxie-inducible promoter constructs. The sesquiterpene nerolidol remained the major product in both strains. The same strategies were applied to construct a limonene-producing strain, which produced 76 mg L−1 in batch cultivation. The FPPS regulation method developed here successfully redirected metabolic flux toward monoterpene production. Examination of growth defects in various strains suggested that the intracellular FPP concentration had a significant effect on growth rate. Further strategies are required to balance intracellular production of FPP and GPP so as to maximise monoterpene production without impacting on cellular growth.",

     "abstract": "Microbial production of butanol by solventogenic Clostridium has long been complicated with the formation of acetone as an unwanted product, which causes poor product yields and creates a most important problem concerning substrate transformation. Intensive attempts concentrate on carbon conversion pathways to eliminate acetone, but have actually achieved little so far. Here, we believe microbial product distribution can largely depend on how the cell plays its energetic cofactors in central metabolism, and demonstrate that by introducing a synthetic 2,3-butanediol synthesis pathway in Clostridium acetobutylicum as an NADH-compensating module to readjust the reducing power at a systems level, the production of acetone can be selectively and efficiently eliminated (< 0.3 g/L). H2 evolution was reduced by 78%, and the total alcohol yield was strikingly increased by 19% to 0.44 g/g glucose, much higher than those yet reported for butanol fermentation. These findings highlight that it is the loss of reducing power rather than typically manipulated solventogenesis genes that dominates acetone formation. Further study revealed that the NADH-module triggered apparent regulation of pathways involved in electron transfer and reducing power conservation. The study also suggested the key to conservation of intracellular reducing power might essentially lie in the intermediate processes in central metabolism that are related to redox partners, butyrate or C4 branches, and possibly NADH and NADPH specificity. This study represents the first effective redox-based configuration of C. acetobutylicum and provides valuable understandings for redox engineering of native Clostridium species towards advanced production of biofuels and alcohols.",

Despite the successful attempts of 3-HP production from glycerol, the biological process suffers from problems arising from low activity and inactivation of the two enzymes. To apply the directed evolutionary approach to engineer the 3-HP production system, we constructed a synthetic selection device using a 3-HP-responsive transcription factor and developed a selection approach for screening 3-HP-producing microorganisms. The method was applied to an ALDH library, specifically aldehyde-binding site library of alpha-ketoglutaric semialdehyde dehydrogenase (KGSADH). Only two serial cultures resulted in enrichment of strains showing increased 3-HP production, and an isolated KGSADH variant enzyme exhibited a 2.79-fold higher catalytic efficiency toward its aldehyde substrate than the wild-type one.

Here, we strived for an efficient production of phenol, a model aromatic compound of industrial relevance, from renewable carbon sources using the solvent-tolerant biocatalyst Pseudomonas taiwanensis VLB120. First, multiple catabolic routes for the degradation of aromatics and related compounds were inactivated, thereby obtaining the chassis strain P. taiwanensis VLB120Δ5 incapable of growing on 4-hydroxybenzoate (ΔpobA), tyrosine (Δhpd), and quinate (ΔquiC, ΔquiC1, ΔquiC2). In this context, a novel gene contributing to the quinate catabolism was identified (quiC2). Second, we employed a combination of reverse- and forward engineering to increase metabolic flux towards the product, using leads obtained from the analysis of aromatics producing Pseudomonas putida strains previously generated by mutagenesis. Phenol production was enabled by the heterologous expression of a codon-optimized and chromosomally integrated tyrosine phenol-lyase encoding gene from Pantoea agglomerans AJ2985 (PaTPL2). The genomic modification of endogenous genes encoding TrpEP290S, AroF-1P148L, and PheAT310I, and the deletion of pykA improved phenol production 17-fold, while also minimizing the burden caused by plasmids and auxotrophies. The additional overexpression of known bottleneck enzymes (AroGfbr, TyrAfbr) derived from Escherichia coli further enhanced phenol titers. The best producing strain P. taiwanensis VLB120Δ5-TPL36 reached yields of 15.8% and 18.5% (Cmol/Cmol) phenol from glucose and glycerol, respectively, in a mineral medium without addition of complex nutrients. This is the highest yield ever reported for microbially produced phenol.",

However, its large-scale production is still hindered by the high cost. Here we report the engineering of Halomonas bluephagenesis as a low-cost platform for non-sterile and continuous fermentative production of P(3HB-co−4HB) from glucose. Two interrelated 4-hydroxybutyrate (4HB) biosynthesis pathways were constructed to guarantee 4HB monomer supply for P(3HB-co−4HB) synthesis by working in concert with 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) pathway. Interestingly, only 0.17 mol% 4HB in the copolymer was obtained during shake flask studies. Pathway debugging using structurally related carbon source located the failure as insufficient 4HB accumulation. Further whole genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis identified multiple orthologs of succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (gabD) that may compete with 4HB synthesis flux in H. bluephagenesis. Accordingly, combinatory gene-knockout strains were constructed and characterized, through which the molar fraction of 4HB was increased by 24-fold in shake flask studies. The best-performing strain was grown on glucose as the single carbon source for 60 h under non-sterile conditions in a 7-L bioreactor, reaching 26.3 g/L of dry cell mass containing 60.5% P(3HB-co−17.04 mol%4HB). Besides, 4HB molar fraction in the copolymer can be tuned from 13 mol% to 25 mol% by controlling the residual glucose concentration in the cultures.

     "abstract": "Background: The optimization of metabolic rates (as linear objective functions) represents the methodical core of flux-balance analysis techniques which have become a standard tool for the study of genome-scale metabolic models. Besides (growth and synthesis) rates, metabolic yields are key parameters for the characterization of biochemical transformation processes, especially in the context of biotechnological applications. However, yields are ratios of rates, and hence the optimization of yields (as nonlinear objective functions) under arbitrary linear constraints is not possible with current flux-balance analysis techniques. Despite the fundamental importance of yields in constraint-based modeling, a comprehensive mathematical framework for yield optimization is still missing.Results: We present a mathematical theory that allows one to systematically compute and analyze yield-optimal solutions of metabolic models under arbitrary linear constraints. In particular, we formulate yield optimization as a linear-fractional program. For practical computations, we transform the linear-fractional yield optimization problem to a (higher-dimensional) linear problem. Its solutions determine the solutions of the original problem and can be used to predict yield-optimal flux distributions in genome-scale metabolic models. For the theoretical analysis, we consider the linear-fractional problem directly. Most importantly, we show that the yield-optimal solution set (like the rate-optimal solution set) is determined by (yield-optimal) elementary flux vectors of the underlying metabolic model. However, yield- and rate-optimal solutions may differ from each other, and hence optimal (biomass or product) yields are not necessarily obtained at solutions with optimal (growth or synthesis) rates. Moreover, we discuss phase planes/production envelopes and yield spaces, in particular, we prove that yield spaces are convex and provide algorithms for their computation. We illustrate our findings by a small example and demonstrate their relevance for metabolic engineering with realistic models of E. coli.Conclusions: We develop a comprehensive mathematical framework for yield optimization in metabolic models. Our theory is particularly useful for the study and rational modification of cell factories designed under given yield and/or rate requirements.",

     "abstract": "Cyanobacteria fix atmospheric CO2 to biomass and through metabolic engineering can also act as photosynthetic factories for sustainable productions of fuels and chemicals. The Calvin Benson cycle is the primary pathway for CO2 fixation in cyanobacteria, algae and C3 plants. Previous studies have overexpressed the Calvin Benson cycle enzymes, r ib u lose-1,5- bis phosphate c arboxylase/ o xygenase (RuBisCO) and bi functional sedoheptulose-1,7- b isphos p hatase/fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (hereafter BiBPase), in both plants and algae, although their impacts on cyanobacteria have not yet been rigorously studied. Here, we show that overexpression of BiBPase and RuBisCO have distinct impacts on carbon metabolism in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 through physiological, biochemical, and proteomic analyses. The former enhanced growth, cell size, and photosynthetic O2 evolution, and coordinately upregulated enzymes in the Calvin Benson cycle including RuBisCO and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. At the same time it downregulated enzymes in respiratory carbon metabolism (glycolysis and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway) including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). The content of glycogen was also significantly reduced while the soluble carbohydrate content increased. These results indicate that overexpression of BiBPase leads to global reprogramming of carbon metabolism in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, promoting photosynthetic carbon fixation and carbon partitioning towards non-storage carbohydrates. In contrast, whilst overexpression of RuBisCO had no measurable impact on growth and photosynthetic O2 evolution, it led to coordinated increase in the abundance of proteins involved in pyruvate metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis. Our results underpin that singular genetic modifications in the Calvin Benson cycle can have far broader cellular impact than previously expected.

In this study, metabolic fluxes under photoautotrophic growth conditions in the widely-used cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 are quantified by re-analyzing an existing dataset using genome-scale isotopic instationary 13C-Metabolic Flux Analysis (INST-MFA). The reconstructed carbon mapping model imSyn617 and implemented algorithmic updates afforded an approximately 48% reduction in computation time. The mapping model encompasses 18 novel carbon paths spanning Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, photorespiration, an expanded glyoxylate metabolism, and corrinoid biosynthetic pathways and 190 additional metabolites absent in core models currently used for MFA. Flux elucidation reveals that 98% of the fixed carbons is routed towards biomass production with small amounts diverted towards organic acids and glycogen storage. 12% of the fixed carbons are oxidized to CO2 in the TCA cycle and anabolic reactions in peripheral metabolism. Flux elucidation using instationary MFA reveals that these carbons are not re-fixed by RuBisCO and are instead off-gassed as CO2. A newly discovered modality is the bifurcated topology of glycine metabolism using parts of photorespiration and the phosphoserine pathways to avoid carbon losses associated with glycine oxidation. The TCA cycle is shown to be incomplete with a bifurcated topology. Inactivity of futile cycles and alternate routes results in pathway usage and (in)dispensability predictions consistent with experimental findings. The resolved flux map is consistent with the maximization of biomass yield from fixed carbons as the cellular objective function. Flux prediction departures from the ones obtained with the core model demonstrate the importance of constructing mapping models with global coverage to reliably glean new biological insights using labeled substrates.",

However, engineering extremophiles are not an easy task. Halomonas, an industrially interesting halophile able to grow under unsterile and continuous conditions in large-scale processes, can only be engineered using suicide plasmid-mediated two-step homologous recombination which is very laborious and time-consuming (up to half a year). A convenient approach for the engineering of halophiles that can possibly be extended to other extremophiles is therefore urgently required. To meet this requirement, a rapid, efficient and scarless method via CRISPR/Cas9 system was developed in this study for genome editing in Halomonas. The method achieved the highest efficiency of 100%. When eight different mutants were constructed via this special CRISPR/Cas9 method to study the combinatorial influences of four different genes on the glucose catabolism in H. bluephagenesis TD01, it took only three weeks to complete the deletion and insertion of up to 4.5 kb DNA. H. bluephagenesis was designed to produce a microbial copolymer P(3HB-co-3HV) consisting of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV). The CRISPR/Cas9 was employed to delete the prpC gene in H. bluephagenesis TD01. Shake flask studies showed that the 3HV fraction in the copolymers increased approximately 16-folds, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness of the ΔprpC mutant to synthesize PHBV. This genome engineering strategy significantly speeds up the studies on Halomonas engineering, opening up a wide area for developing NGIB.",

We use this framework to predict scaled up growth and product secretion in 1L photobioreactors of two strains of Synechococcus PCC7002 engineered for production of l-lactate or L-lysine.

We reconstructed the trans-chrysanthemic acid biosynthetic pathway in tomato fruits, which naturally produce high levels of the tetraterpene pigment lycopene, an isoprenoid which shares a common precursor, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), with trans-chrysanthemic acid. trans-Chrysanthemic acid biosynthesis in tomato fruit was achieved by expressing the chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase gene from T. cinerariifolium, encoding the enzyme that uses DMAPP to make trans-chrysanthemol, under the control of the fruit specific promoter PG, as well as an alcohol dehydrogenease (ADH) gene and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene from a wild tomato species, also under the control of the PG promoter. Tomato fruits expressing all three genes had a concentration of trans-chrysanthemic acid that was about 1.7-fold higher (by weight) than the levels of lycopene present in non-transgenic fruit, while the level of lycopene in the transgenic plants was reduced by 68%. Ninety seven percent of the diverted DMAPP was converted to trans-chrysanthemic acid, but 62% of this acid was further glycosylated.

This feature provides the attractive possibility of producing MA from mixtures of aromatics found in depolymerized lignin, the most underutilized lignocellulosic biopolymer. Based on the metabolic pathway, the catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene) node is the central element of this type of production process: (i) all upper catabolic pathways of aromatics converge at catechol as the central intermediate, (ii) catechol itself is frequently generated during lignin pre-processing, and (iii) catechol is directly converted to the target product MA by catechol 1,2-dioxygenase. However, catechol is highly toxic, which poses a challenge for the bio-production of MA. In this study, the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440 was upgraded to a fully genome-based host for the production of MA from catechol and upstream aromatics. At the core of the cell factories created was a designed synthetic pathway module, comprising both native catechol 1,2-dioxygenases, catA and catA2, under the control of the Pcat promoter. The pathway module increased catechol tolerance, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase levels, and catechol conversion rates. MA, the formed product, acted as an inducer of the module, triggering continuous expression. Cellular energy level and ATP yield were identified as critical parameters during catechol-based production. The engineered MA-6 strain achieved an MA titer of 64.2 g L−1 from catechol in a fed-batch process, which repeatedly regenerated the energy levels via specific feed pauses. The developed process was successfully transferred to the pilot scale to produce kilograms of MA at 97.9% purity. The MA-9 strain, equipped with a phenol hydroxylase, used phenol to produce MA and additionally converted o-cresol, m-cresol, and p-cresol to specific methylated variants of MA.

We here reported an efficient Machine-learning workflow in conjunction with YeastFab Assembly strategy (MiYA) for combinatorial optimizing the large biosynthetic genotypic space of heterologous metabolic pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using β-carotene biosynthetic pathway as example, we first demonstrated that MiYA has the power to search only a small fraction (2–5%) of combinatorial space to precisely tune the expression level of each gene with a machine-learning algorithm of an artificial neural network (ANN) ensemble to avoid over-fitting problem when dealing with a small number of training samples. We then applied MiYA to improve the biosynthesis of violacein. Feed with initial data from a colorimetric plate-based, pre-screened pool of 24 strains producing violacein, MiYA successfully predicted, and verified experimentally, the existence of a strain that showed a 2.42-fold titer improvement in violacein production among 3125 possible designs. Furthermore, MiYA was able to largely avoid the branch pathway of violacein biosynthesis that makes deoxyviolacein, and produces very pure violacein. Together, MiYA combines the advantages of standardized building blocks and machine learning to accelerate the Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle for combinatorial optimization of metabolic pathways, which could significantly accelerate the development of microbial cell factories.",

In this work, we have metabolically engineered Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z for 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) production from methane. The engineered strain 20Z/pBudK.p, harboring the 2,3-BDO synthesis gene cluster (budABC) from Klebsiella pneumoniae, accumulated 2,3-BDO in methane-fed shake flask cultures with a titer of 35.66 mg/L. Expression of the most efficient gene cluster was optimized using selection of promoters, translation initiation rates (TIR), and the combination of 2,3-BDO synthesis genes from different sources. A higher 2,3-BDO titer of 57.7 mg/L was measured in the 20Z/pNBM-Re strain with budA of K. pneumoniae and budB of Bacillus subtilis under the control of the Tac promoter. The genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction of M. alcaliphilum 20Z enabled in silico gene knockout predictions using an evolutionary programming method to couple growth and 2,3-BDO production. The ldh, ack, and mdh genes in M. alcaliphilum 20Z were identified as potential knockout targets. Pursuing these targets, a triple-mutant strain ∆ldh ∆ack ∆mdh was constructed, resulting in a further increase of the 2,3-BDO titer to 68.8 mg/L. The productivity of this optimized strain was then tested in a fed-batch stirred tank bioreactor, where final product concentrations of up to 86.2 mg/L with a yield of 0.0318 g-(2,3-BDO) /g-CH4 were obtained under O2-limited conditions.

     "abstract": "Specialized metabolites from bacteria are an important source of inspiration for drug development. The genes required for the biosynthesis of such metabolites in bacteria are usually organized in so-called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Using modern bioinformatic tools, the wealth of genomic data can be scanned for such BGCs and the expected products can often structurally be predicted in silico. This facilitates the directed discovery of putatively novel bacterial metabolites. However, the production of these molecules often requires genetic manipulation of the BGC for activation or the expression of the pathway in a heterologous host. The latter necessitates the transplantation of the BGC into a suitable expression system. To achieve this goal, powerful cloning strategies based on in vivo homologous recombination have recently been developed. This includes LCHR and LLHR in E. coli as well as TAR cloning in yeast. Here, we present Direct Pathway Cloning (DiPaC) as an efficient complementary BGC capturing strategy that relies on long-amplicon PCR and in vitro DNA assembly. This straightforward approach facilitates full pathway assembly, BGC refactoring and direct transfer into any vector backbone in vitro. The broad applicability and efficiency of DiPaC is demonstrated by the discovery of a new phenazine from Serratia fonticola, the first heterologous production of anabaenopeptins from Nostoc punctiforme and the transfer of the native erythromycin BGC from Saccharopolyspora erythraea into Streptomyces. Due to its simplicity, we envisage DiPaC to become an essential method for BGC cloning and metabolic pathways construction with significant applications in metabolic engineering, synthetic biology and biotechnology.",

In this work, we undertake a comparative analysis of two related but functionally distinct methods of high-throughput screening: traditional single cell fluorescence activated cell sorting (single cell FACS) and microdroplet-enabled FACS (droplet FACS) using water/oil/water (w/o/w) emulsions. To do so, we first engineer and evolve the non-conventional yeast Yarrowia lipolytica for high extracellular production of riboflavin (vitamin B2), an innately fluorescent product. Following mutagenesis and adaptive evolution, a direct parity-matched comparison of these two selection strategies was conducted. Both single cell FACS and droplet FACS led to significant increases in total riboflavin titer (32 and 54 fold relative to the parental PO1f strain, respectively). However, single cell FACS favored intracellular riboflavin accumulation (with only 70% of total riboflavin secreted) compared with droplet FACS that favored extracellular product accumulation (with 90% of total riboflavin secreted). We find that for the test case of riboflavin, the extent of secretion and total production were highly correlated. The resulting differences in production modes and levels clearly demonstrate the significant impact that selection approaches can exert on final evolutionary outcomes in strain engineering. Moreover, we note that these results provide a cautionary tale when intracellular read-outs of product concentration (including signals from biosensors) are used as surrogates for total production of potentially secreted products. In this regard, these results demonstrate that extracellular production is best assayed through an encapsulation technique when performing high throughput screening.",

Here, we used a highly sophisticated set-up of parallel 13C tracer studies with labeling analysis by GC/MS, LC/MS, 1D, and 2D NMR to resolve carbon fluxes in the overproducing strain A. gossypii B2 during growth and subsequent riboflavin production from vegetable oil as carbon source, yeast extract, and supplemented glycine. The studies provided a detailed picture of the underlying metabolism. Glycine was exclusively used as carbon-two donor of the vitamin’s pyrimidine ring, which is part of its isoalloxazine ring structure, but did not contribute to the carbon-one metabolism due to the proven absence of a functional glycine cleavage system. The pools of serine and glycine were closely connected due to a highly reversible serine hydroxymethyltransferase. Transmembrane formate flux simulations revealed that the one-carbon metabolism displayed a severe bottleneck during initial riboflavin production, which was overcome in later phases of the cultivation by intrinsic formate accumulation. The transiently limiting carbon-one pool was successfully replenished by time-resolved feeding of small amounts of formate and serine, respectively. This increased the intracellular availability of glycine, serine, and formate and resulted in a final riboflavin titer increase of 45%.",

Here, we report metabolic engineering of novel B. subtilis strains in which the carbon flux has been partially diverted from central metabolism, i.e. the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and glycolysis, into HA biosynthesis. First, an improved base strain of B. subtilis was engineered for more effective HA production with less susceptibility to catabolite repression when expressing genes from a xylose-inducible promoter. Subsequently, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats interference (CRISPRi) was applied to reduce the expression of individual pfkA or zwf in the base strain, leading to substantial improvements to the HA titer with a concomitant decrease in the molecular weight (MW). On the other hand, multiplexed repression of both pfkA and zwf expression resulted in increases to the HA titer of up to 108% and enhancements to the MW, compared to the base strain. Moreover, the addition of exogenous HA monomers, i.e. glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc), to B. subtilis cultures markedly improved the HA MW but decreased the HA titer, providing insights into the mechanism of HA biosynthesis by streptococcal hyaluronan synthase (SeHAS) in B. subtilis.

Production of such a fatty acid derivative is limited by chemical catalysis, but plausible by biocatalysis. However, its low productivity issue, including formations of unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) byproducts in host cells, remains as a hurdle toward industrial biological processes. In this study, to achieve selective and high-level production of ω-HPA from glucose in Escherichia coli, FadR, a native transcriptional regulator of fatty acid metabolism, and its regulon were engineered. First, FadR was co-expressed with a thioesterase with a specificity toward palmitic acid production to enhance palmitic acid production yield, but a considerable quantity of UFAs was also produced. In order to avoid the UFA production caused by fadR overexpression, FadR regulon was rewired by i) mutating FadR consensus binding sites of fabA or fabB, ii) integrating fabZ into fabI operon, and iii) enhancing the strength of fabI promoter. This approach led to dramatic increases in both proportion (48.3–83.0%) and titer (377.8 mg/L to 675.8 mg/L) of palmitic acid, mainly due to the decrease in UFA synthesis. Introducing a fatty acid ω-hydroxylase, CYP153A35, into the engineered strain resulted in a highly selective production of ω-HPA (83.5 mg/L) accounting for 87.5% of total ω-hydroxy fatty acids. Furthermore, strategies, such as i) enhancement in CYP153A35 activity, ii) expression of a fatty acid transporter, iii) supplementation of triton X-100, and iv) separation of the ω-HPA synthetic pathway into two strains for a co-culture system, were applied and resulted in 401.0 mg/L of ω-HPA production.

The three types of regulations identified so far, namely repression, attenuation, and feedback inhibition have greatly impacted our understanding and engineering of cellular metabolism. In this study, feed-forward regulation is discovered as a novel regulation of this pathway and explored for engineering Escherichia coli for more efficient Trp biosynthesis. Specifically, indole glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) of the multifunctional enzyme TrpC from E. coli is found to be feed-forward inhibited by anthranilate noncompetitively. Surprisingly, IGPS of TrpC from both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger was found to be feed-forward activated, for which the glutamine aminotransferase domain is essential. The anthranilate binding site of IGPS from E. coli is identified and mutated, resulting in more tolerant variants for improved Trp biosynthesis. Furthermore, expressing the anthranilate-activated TrpC from A. niger in a previously engineered Trp producing E. coli strain S028 made the strain more robust in growth and more efficient in Trp production in bioreactor. It not only increased the Trp concentration from 19 to 29 g/L within 42 h, but also improved the maximum Trp yield from 0.15 to 0.18 g/g in simple fed-batch fermentations, setting a new level to rationally designed Trp producing strains.

However, in situ CO2 recycling was hindered by clogs of pyruvate during glucose metabolism, which consequently resulted in an insufficient regeneration of NAD+ through the pflB-mediated ethanol production. Recombinant plasmid pLOI295 (encodes pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase II, referred to as the Pdc-based carbon tap valve (CTV) for convenience) was introduced into E. coli MZLFB + CTV to bypass the pflB-mediated ethanol production. Results show that while the C-2/C-1 ratio (i.e., the molar ratio of ethanol and acetate to formate and total CO2) for parental strain MZLFB was 1.0 ± 0.1, the C-2/C-1 for MZLFB + CTV increased to 1.6 ± 0.1. This indicates that the Pdc-based CTV enhanced the performance of in situ CO2 recycling. By simultaneously utilizing glucose and CO2, the fermentation product yield of MZLFB + CTV exceeded the normal theoretical yield and reached 2.2 ± 0.0 (mol/mol). In silico analysis shows that 61% of the glucose consumption went through the Rubisco-based engineered pathway when the CTV was equipped.

Sirtuins catalyse the removal of acetyl groups from lysine side chains of proteins using NAD+ as a stoichiometric cofactor, thereby connecting the acetylation state of histones to energy supply of the cell. Here, we investigate the impact of lysine acetylation turnover by sirtuins on cell physiology by engineering Sirtase, an enzyme that self-acetylates and deacetylates in futile cycles. Expression of Sirtase in E. coli leads to the consumption of the majority of the cellular NAD+ supply, indicating that there is little negative feedback from reaction products, O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and nicotinamde, on sirtuin activity. Targeting Sirtase to a partially defective E silencer of the budding yeast mating type locus restores silencing, indicating that lysine acetylation turnover stabilizes heterochromatin in yeast. We speculate that this could be the consequence of local acetyl-CoA depletion because the effect is equally pronounced if the sirtuin moiety of Sirtase is exchanged with Hos3, a NAD+-independent deacetylase. Our findings support the concept that metabolism and epigenetic regulation are linked via modulation of heterochromatin stability by lysine acetylation turnover.",

The RecET recombineering system developed here allowed successful integration of biosynthetic gene clusters for four proof-of-concept bioproducts, including protein, polyketide, isoprenoid, and amino acid derivative, into the target genetic locus of P. putida chromosome. The markerless recombineering system was completed by combining Cre/lox system and developing efficient plasmid curing systems, generating final strains free of antibiotic markers and plasmids. This markerless recombineering system for efficient gene knockout and integration will expedite metabolic engineering of P. putida, a bacterial host strain of increasing academic and industrial interest.",

     "abstract": "The amino acid lysine is among the world’s most important biotechnological products, and enabling its manufacture from the most attractive new materials is an ever-present challenge. In this study, we describe a cell factory of Corynebacterium glutamicum, which produces lysine from mannitol. A preliminary mutant C. glutamicum SEA-1 obtained by the deletion of the mannitol repressor MtlR in the glucose-based, lysine-producing strain C. glutamicum LYS-12 produced only small amounts of lysine. This limitation was due to a significant accumulation of fructose and a limited NADPH supply, which caused a low flux of only 6% into the oxidative pentose phosphate (PP) pathway. Subsequent expression of fructokinase slightly increased production but failed to substantially redirect the flux from the Emden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway to the PP pathway. This suggested the design of C. glutamicum SEA-3, which overexpressed the NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase GapN from Streptococcus mutans and coupled the EMP pathway flux to NADPH formation. When grown on mannitol, the SEA-3 strain had a lysine yield of 0.24 mol mol-1 and a specific productivity of 1.3 mmol g-1 h-1, approximately 60% and 75% higher, respectively, than those of the basic producer SEA-1. A computational pathway analysis revealed that this design would potentially enable a lysine yield of 0.9 mol mol-1, providing room for further development. Our findings open new avenues for lysine production from marine macroalgae, which is farmed globally as an attractive third-generation renewable resource. Mannitol is a major constituent of these algae (up to 30% and higher) and can be easily extracted from their biomass with hot water.",

Here, we leveraged a flow cytometric fluorescence-based assay to improve Man3GlcNAc2 glycan biosynthesis in E. coli cells.

In turn, cells producing higher levels of the Man3GlcNAc2 substrate yielded up to 10 times more glycosylated acceptor protein (to ~ 14 mg/L) than their non-optimized counterparts.

This strategy provides enough ATP to improve the efficiency of CO2 fixation and simultaneously rewires the CO2-fixing pathway to the central metabolic pathway for the biosynthesis of chemicals. We demonstrate the application of this strategy by increasing the CO2-fixing rate and malate production in the autotroph Synechococcus elongatus by 110% and to 260 μM respectively, as well as increasing these two factors in the heterotrophic CO2-fixing Escherichia coli by 870% and to 387 mM respectively.",

     "abstract": "Biologically-derived hydrocarbons are considered to have great potential as next-generation biofuels owing to the similarity of their chemical properties to contemporary diesel and jet fuels. However, the low yield of these hydrocarbons in biotechnological production is a major obstacle for commercialization. Several genetic and process engineering approaches have been adopted to increase the yield of hydrocarbon, but a model driven approach has not been implemented so far. Here, we applied a constraint-based metabolic modeling approach in which a variable demand for alkane biosynthesis was imposed, and co-varying reactions were considered as potential targets for further engineering of an E. coli strain already expressing cyanobacterial enzymes towards higher chain alkane production. The reactions that co-varied with the imposed alkane production were found to be mainly associated with the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the lower half of glycolysis. An optimal modeling solution was achieved by imposing increased flux through the reaction catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (zwf) and iteratively removing 7 reactions from the network, leading to an alkane yield of 94.2% of the theoretical maximum conversion determined by in silico analysis at a given biomass rate. To validate the in silico findings, we first performed pathway optimization of the cyanobacterial enzymes in E. coli via different dosages of genes, promoting substrate channelling through protein fusion and inducing substantial equivalent protein expression, which led to a 36-fold increase in alka(e)ne production from 2.8 mg/L to 102 mg/L. Further, engineering of E. coli based on in silico findings, including biomass constraint, led to an increase in the alka(e)ne titer to 425 mg/L (major components being 249 mg/L pentadecane and 160 mg/L heptadecene), a 148.6-fold improvement over the initial strain, respectively; with a yield of 34.2% of the theoretical maximum. The impact of model-assisted engineering was also tested for the production of long chain fatty alcohol, another commercially important molecule sharing the same pathway while differing only at the terminal reaction, and a titer of 1506 mg/L was achieved with a yield of 86.4% of the theoretical maximum. Moreover, the model assisted engineered strains had produced 2.54 g/L and 12.5 g/L of long chain alkane and fatty alcohol, respectively, in the bioreactor under fed-batch cultivation condition. Our study demonstrated successful implementation of a combined in silico modeling approach along with the pathway and process optimization in achieving the highest reported titers of long chain hydrocarbons in E. coli.",

     "abstract": "Muconic acid (MA) is a dicarboxylic acid used for the production of industrially relevant chemicals such as adipic acid, terephthalic acid, and caprolactam. Because the synthesis of these polymer precursors generates toxic intermediates by utilizing petroleum-derived chemicals and corrosive catalysts, the development of alternative strategies for the bio-based production of MA has garnered significant interest. Plants produce organic carbon skeletons by harvesting carbon dioxide and energy from the sun, and therefore represent advantageous hosts for engineered metabolic pathways towards the manufacturing of chemicals. In this work, we engineered Arabidopsis to demonstrate that plants can serve as green factories for the bio-manufacturing of MA. In particular, dual expression of plastid-targeted bacterial salicylate hydroxylase (NahG) and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (CatA) resulted in the conversion of the endogenous salicylic acid (SA) pool into MA via catechol. Sequential increase of SA derived from the shikimate pathway was achieved by expressing plastid-targeted versions of bacterial salicylate synthase (Irp9) and feedback-resistant 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate synthase (AroG). Introducing this SA over-producing strategy into engineered plants that co-express NahG and CatA resulted in a 50-fold increase in MA titers. Considering that MA was easily recovered from senesced plant biomass after harvest, we envision the phytoproduction of MA as a beneficial option to add value to bioenergy crops.",

     "abstract": "Plants are versatile chemists producing a tremendous variety of specialized compounds. Here, we describe the engineering of entirely novel metabolic pathways in planta enabling generation of halogenated indigo precursors as non-natural plant products.Indican (indolyl-β-D-glucopyranoside) is a secondary metabolite characteristic of a number of dyers plants. Its deglucosylation and subsequent oxidative dimerization leads to the blue dye, indigo. Halogenated indican derivatives are commonly used as detection reagents in histochemical and molecular biology applications; their production, however, relies largely on chemical synthesis. To attain the de novo biosynthesis in a plant-based system devoid of indican, we employed a sequence of enzymes from diverse sources, including three microbial tryptophan halogenases substituting the amino acid at either C5, C6, or C7 of the indole moiety. Subsequent processing of the halotryptophan by bacterial tryptophanase TnaA in concert with a mutant of the human cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 2A6 and glycosylation of the resulting indoxyl derivatives by an endogenous tobacco glucosyltransferase yielded corresponding haloindican variants in transiently transformed Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Accumulation levels were highest when the 5-halogenase PyrH was utilized, reaching 0.93 ± 0.089 mg/g dry weight of 5-chloroindican. The identity of the latter was unambiguously confirmed by NMR analysis. Moreover, our combinatorial approach, facilitated by the modular assembly capabilities of the GoldenBraid cloning system and inspired by the unique compartmentation of plant cells, afforded testing a number of alternative subcellular localizations for pathway design. In consequence, chloroplasts were validated as functional biosynthetic venues for haloindican, with the requisite reducing augmentation of the halogenases as well as the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase fulfilled by catalytic systems native to the organelle.Thus, our study puts forward a viable alternative production platform for halogenated fine chemicals, eschewing reliance on fossil fuel resources and toxic chemicals. We further contend that in planta generation of halogenated indigoid precursors previously unknown to nature offers an extended view on and, indeed, pushes forward the established frontiers of biosynthetic capacity of plants.",

The genes encoding these three enzymes were transcribed under the control of promoter pTrc on pTrc99A, to form pJNU-3, which was harbored by strain Mgly1, resulting in strain Mgly13. Strain Mgly13 produced glycolate with 0.385 g/g-glucose yield (45.2% of the theoretical yield).

However, the behaviors of non-native metabolic pathways may be difficult to control due to the different intracellular contexts between natural and heterologous hosts. While most metabolic engineering efforts focus on strengthening driving forces in pathway design to favor biochemical production in these organisms, excessive driving force may be detrimental to product biosynthesis due to imbalanced cellular intermediate distribution. In this study, an ATP-hydrolysis based driving force module was engineered into cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 to produce 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB), a valuable chemical feedstock for the synthesis of biodegradable plastics and antibiotics. However, while the ATP driving force module is effective for increasing product formation, uncontrolled accumulation of intermediate metabolites likely led to metabolic imbalance and thus to cell growth inhibition. Therefore, the ATP driving force module was reengineered by providing a reversible outlet for excessive carbon flux. Upon expression of this balanced ATP driving force module with 3HB biosynthesis, engineered strain produced 3HB with a cumulative titer of 1.2 g/L, a significant increase over the initial strain. This result highlighted the importance of pathway reversibility as an effective design strategy for balancing driving force and intermediate accumulation, thereby achieving a self-regulated control for increased net flux towards product biosynthesis.",

In this work, we observed a higher naturally copper internalization in a robust S. cerevisiae strain engineered to produce the antioxidant l-ascorbic acid (L-AA), compared with the wild type strain. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the alteration of copper homeostasis on cellular stress tolerance. CTR1 and FRE1 genes, codifying for a plasma membrane high-affinity copper transporter and for a cell-surface ferric/cupric reductase, respectively, were overexpressed in both wild type and L-AA cells. Remarkably, we found that the sole FRE1 overexpression was sufficient to increase copper internalization leading to an enhanced stress tolerance toward H2O2 exposure, in both strains under investigation.

     "abstract": "Valine, which is one of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) essential for humans, is widely used in animal feed, dietary supplements and pharmaceuticals. At the commercial level, valine is usually produced by bacterial fermentation from glucose. However, valine biosynthesis can also proceed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is a useful microorganism in fermentation industry. In S. cerevisiae, valine biosynthesis is regulated by valine itself via the feedback inhibition of acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS), which consists of two subunits, the catalytic subunit Ilv2 and the regulatory subunit Ilv6. In this study, to improve the valine productivity of yeast cells, we constructed several variants of Ilv6 by introducing amino acid substitutions based on a protein sequence comparison with the AHAS regulatory subunit of E. coli. Among them, we found that the Asn86Ala, Gly89Asp and Asn104Ala variants resulted in approximately 4-fold higher intracellular valine contents compared with those in cells with the wild-type Ilv6. The computational analysis of Ilv6 predicted that Asn86, Gly89 and Asn104 are located in the vicinity of a valine-binding site, suggesting that amino acid substitutions at these positions induce conformational change of the valine-binding site. To test the effects of these variants on AHAS activity, both recombinant Ilv2 and Ilv6 were purified and reconstituted in vitro. The Ilv6 variants were much less sensitive to feedback inhibition by valine than the wild-type Ilv6. Only a portion of the amino acid changes identified in the E. coli AHAS regulatory subunit IlvH enhanced the valine synthesis, suggesting structural and/or functional differences between the S. cerevisiae and E. coli AHAS regulatory subunits. It should also be noted that these amino acid substitutions did not affect the intracellular pools of the other BCAAs, leucine and isoleucine. The approach described here could be a practical method for the development of industrial yeast strains with high-level production of valine or isobutanol.",

First, over-expression of codon-optimized citramalate synthase variant CimA* from Methanococcus jannaschii, endogenous isopropylmalate isomerase EcLeuCD and enoate reductase YqjM from Bacillus subtilis allowed the production of 2-MSA in Escherichia coli for the first time, with a titer of 0.35 g/L in shake flask experiments. Subsequent screening of YqjM-like enoate reductases of different bacterial origins enabled identification and characterization of a new NAD(P)H-dependent enoate reductase KpnER from Klebsiella pneumoniae, which exhibited higher activity towards citraconate than YqjM. Incorporation of KpnER into the 2-MSA biosynthetic pathway led to 2-MSA production improvement to a titer of 0.96 g/L in aerobic condition. Subsequent optimizations including cofactor regeneration, microaerobic cultivation and host strain engineering, boosted 2-MSA titer to 3.61 g/L with a molar yield of 0.36 in shake flask experiments. This work established a promising platform for 2-MSA bioproduction, which enabled the highest titer of 2-MSA production in microbial hosts so far.",

     "abstract": "An engineered reversal of the β-oxidation cycle (r-BOX) and the fatty acid biosynthesis (FAB) pathway are promising biological platforms for advanced fuel and chemical production in part due to their iterative nature supporting the synthesis of various chain length products. While diverging in their carbon-carbon elongation reaction mechanism, iterative operation of each pathway relies on common chemical conversions (reduction, dehydration, and reduction) differing only in the attached moiety (acyl carrier protein (ACP) in FAB vs Coenzyme A in r-BOX). Given this similarity, we sought to determine whether FAB enzymes can be used in the context of r-BOX as a means of expanding available r-BOX components with a ubiquitous set of well characterized enzymes. Using enzymes from the type II FAB pathway (FabG, FabZ, and FabI) in conjunction with a thiolase catalyzing a non-decarboxylative condensation, we demonstrate that FAB enzymes support a functional r-BOX. Pathway operation with FAB enzymes was improved through computationally directed protein design to develop FabZ variants with amino acid substitutions designed to disrupt hydrogen bonding at the FabZ-ACP interface and introduce steric and electrostatic repulsion between the FabZ and ACP. FabZ with R126W and R121E substitutions resulted in improved carboxylic acid and alcohol production from one- and multiple-turn r-BOX compared to the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, the ability for FAB enzymes to operate on functionalized intermediates was exploited to produce branched chain carboxylic acids through an r-BOX with functionalized priming. These results not only provide an expanded set of enzymes within the modular r-BOX pathway, but can also potentially expand the scope of products targeted through this pathway by operating with CoA intermediates containing various functional groups.",

Cell rigidity was achieved by thickening the cell walls via insertion of a constitutive gltA (encoding citrate synthase) promoter in front of a series of cell wall synthesis genes on the chromosome of several E. coli derivatives, resulting in 1.32–1.60 folds increase of Young's modulus in mechanical strength for longer E. coli cells over-expressing fission ring FtsZ protein inhibiting gene sulA. Cell rigidity was weakened by down regulating expressions of ten genes in the cell wall synthesis pathway using CRISPRi, leading to elastic cells with more spaces for PHB accumulation.

     "abstract": "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an attractive host for industrial scale production of biofuels including fatty alcohols due to its robustness and tolerance towards harsh fermentation conditions. Many metabolic engineering strategies have been applied to generate high fatty alcohol production strains. However, impaired growth caused by fatty alcohol accumulation and high cost of extraction are factors limiting large-scale production. Here, we demonstrate that the use of heterologous transporters is a promising strategy to increase fatty alcohol production. Among several plant and mammalian transporters tested, human FATP1 was shown to mediate fatty alcohol export in a high fatty alcohol production yeast strain. An approximately five-fold increase of fatty alcohol secretion was achieved. The results indicate that the overall cell fitness benefited from fatty alcohol secretion and that the acyl-CoA synthase activity of FATP1 contributed to increased cell growth as well. This is the first study that enabled an increased cell fitness for fatty alcohol production by heterologous transporter expression in yeast, and this investigation indicates a new potential function of FATP1, which has been known as a free fatty acid importer to date. We furthermore successfully identified the functional domain of FATP1 involved in fatty alcohol export through domain exchange between FATP1 and another transporter, FATP4. This study may facilitate a successful commercialization of fatty alcohol production in yeast and inspire the design of novel cell factories.",

     "abstract": "Building biosynthetic pathways and engineering metabolic reactions in cells can be time-consuming due to complexities in cellular metabolism. These complexities often convolute the combinatorial testing of biosynthetic pathway designs needed to define an optimal biosynthetic system. To simplify the optimization of biosynthetic systems, we recently reported a new cell-free framework for pathway construction and testing. In this framework, multiple crude-cell extracts are selectively enriched with individual pathway enzymes, which are then mixed to construct full biosynthetic pathways on the time scale of a day. This rapid approach to building pathways aids in the study of metabolic pathway performance by providing a unique freedom of design to modify and control biological systems for both fundamental and applied biotechnology. The goal of this work was to demonstrate the ability to probe biosynthetic pathway performance in our cell-free framework by perturbing physiochemical conditions, using n-butanol synthesis as a model. We carried out three unique case studies. First, we demonstrated the power of our cell-free approach to maximize biosynthesis yields by mapping physiochemical landscapes using a robotic liquid-handler. This allowed us to determine that NAD and CoA are the most important factors that govern cell-free n-butanol metabolism. Second, we compared metabolic profile differences between two different approaches for building pathways from enriched lysates, heterologous expression and cell-free protein synthesis. We discover that phosphate from PEP utilization, along with other physiochemical reagents, during cell-free protein synthesis-coupled, crude-lysate metabolic system operation inhibits optimal cell-free n-butanol metabolism. Third, we show that non-phosphorylated secondary energy substrates can be used to fuel cell-free protein synthesis and n-butanol biosynthesis. Taken together, our work highlights the ease of using cell-free systems to explore physiochemical perturbations and suggests the need for a more controllable, multi-step, separated cell-free framework for future pathway prototyping and enzyme discovery efforts.",

However, the free-energy conservation of fermentative pathways is often insufficient for the production and export of the desired compounds and/or for cellular growth and maintenance. To increase free-energy conservation during fermentation of the industrially relevant disaccharide sucrose by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we first replaced the native yeast α-glucosidases by an intracellular sucrose phosphorylase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides (LmSPase). Subsequently, we replaced the native proton-coupled sucrose uptake system by a putative sucrose facilitator from Phaseolus vulgaris (PvSUF1). The resulting strains grew anaerobically on sucrose at specific growth rates of 0.09 ± 0.02 h−1 (LmSPase) and 0.06 ± 0.01 h−1 (PvSUF1, LmSPase). Overexpression of the yeast PGM2 gene, which encodes phosphoglucomutase, increased anaerobic growth rates on sucrose of these strains to 0.23 ± 0.01 h−1 and 0.08 ± 0.00 h−1, respectively. Determination of the biomass yield in anaerobic sucrose-limited chemostat cultures was used to assess the free-energy conservation of the engineered strains. Replacement of intracellular hydrolase with a phosphorylase increased the biomass yield on sucrose by 31%. Additional replacement of the native proton-coupled sucrose uptake system by PvSUF1 increased the anaerobic biomass yield by a further 8%, resulting in an overall increase of 41%.

However, this process is limited by the inaccessible raw material, the strict reaction conditions and the relatively low product yield. Here, we report establishment of a novel and efficient biosynthetic pathway for the synthesis of pyrogallol. First, we identified and characterized an efficient 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA) 1-monoxygenase from a series of oxygenases and hydroxylases based on the structural similarity in the substrates and products, which enabled non-natural production of pyrogallol from 2,3-DHBA. Then, over-expression of 2,3-DHBA synthase and 2,3-DHBA 1-monoxygenase achieved synthesis of pyrogallol in Escherichia coli, with a titer of 201.52 mg/L at 24 h. Further optimizations by enhancement of the carbon flux through the shikimate pathway, modular optimization of the pathway and alleviation of the pyrogallol autoxidation boosted pyrogallol titer to 1035.75 mg/L in shake flask experiments.

To allow the simultaneous utilization of multiple carbon sources and to prevent the time-consuming adaptation to each individual nutrient in biotechnological applications, mutants lacking carbon catabolite repression can be used. However, such mutants often exhibit pleiotropic growth defects. We have isolated and characterized mutations that overcome the growth defect of Bacillus subtilis ccpA mutants lacking the major regulator of catabolite repression, in particular their glutamate auxotrophy. Here we show, that distinct mutations affecting the essential DNA topoisomerase I (TopA) cause glutamate prototrophy of the ccpA mutant. These suppressing variants of the TopA enzyme exhibit increased activity resulting in enhanced relaxation of the DNA. Reduced DNA supercoiling results in enhanced expression of the gltAB operon encoding the biosynthetic glutamate synthase. This is achieved by a significant re-organization of the global transcription network accompanied by re-routing of metabolism, which results in inactivation of the glutamate dehydrogenase. Our results provide a link between DNA topology, the global transcriptional network, and glutamate metabolism and suggest that specific topA mutants may be well suited for biotechnological purposes.",

Biosynthesis of monacolin J and lovastatin was improved by 55% and 71%, respectively, when the upstream and downstream modules were separately accommodated in two different fluorescent strains, split at the metabolic node of dihydromonacolin L. However, pathway distribution at monacolin J blocked lovastatin biosynthesis in all designs, mainly due to its limited ability of crossing cellular membranes. Bioreactor fermentations were tested for the optimal co-culture strategies, and yields of 593.9 mg/L monacolin J and 250.8 mg/L lovastatin were achieved. This study provides an alternative method for production of monacolin J and lovastatin and reveals the potential of a methylotrophic yeast to produce complicated pharmaceuticals from methanol.",

None of the lignin-based fermentation processes so far managed to use guaiacol (2-methoxy phenol), the predominant aromatic monomer in depolymerized lignin. In this work, we describe metabolic engineering of Amycolatopsis sp. ATCC 39116 to produce cis,cis-muconic acid (MA), a precursor of recognized industrial value for commercial plastics, from guaiacol. The microbe utilized a very broad spectrum of lignin-based aromatics, such as catechol, guaiacol, phenol, toluene, p-coumarate, and benzoate, tolerated them in elevated amounts and even preferred them over sugars. As a next step, we developed a novel approach for genomic engineering of this challenging, GC-rich actinomycete. The successful introduction of conjugation and blue-white screening, using β-glucuronidase, enabled tailored genomic modifications within ten days. Successive deletion of two putative muconate cycloisomerases from the genome provided the mutant Amycolatopsis sp. ATCC 39116 MA-2, which accumulated 3.1 g L-1 MA from guaiacol within 24 h, achieving a yield of 96%. The mutant was found also capable to produce MA from a guaiacol-rich true lignin hydrolysate, obtained from pine through hydrothermal conversion. This provides an important proof-of-concept to successfully coupling chemical and biochemical process steps into a value chain from the lignin polymer to an industrial chemical. In addition, Amycolatopsis sp. ATCC 39116 MA-2 was able to produce 2-methyl MA from o-cresol (2-methyl phenol), which opens possibilities towards polymers with novel architecture and properties.",

     "abstract": "Photosynthetic microbial hosts such as cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae have recently emerged as alternative engineering platforms for the sustainable light-driven bio-production of terpenoids. Many desirable compounds with numerous applications can be produced in microorganisms by heterologous expression of terpene synthases. However, success of green microbial systems has been hampered by issues such as insufficient enzyme expression titers and low flux to desired terpenoid products from carbon fixed during photosynthesis. This work demonstrates how the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can be engineered to produce the sesquiterpene biodiesel precursor (E)-α-bisabolene. Through strategic genetic engineering, substantial enhancements of productivity were achieved by coordinated tuning of the isoprenoid metabolism, combining serial enzyme loading for terpene synthase overexpression and amiRNA-based repression of competing pathways. Up to 10.3 ± 0.7 mg bisabolene·g−1 cell dry weight could be produced in five days, which represents more than a 15-fold increase over single synthase expression strains. Investigation of strain performance in scale-up cultivations determined overall bisabolene productivity benefits from light:dark cycles. Mixotrophic cultivation can yield up to 11.0 ± 0.5 mg bisabolene per liter in seven days in these conditions, and phototrophic production of 3.9 ± 0.2 mg per liter was feasible. These achievements represent an important milestone in the engineering of C. reinhardtii towards the goal of designing sustainable, light-driven, green-cell algal bio-factories.",

Here we compared the expansion potential of the metabolic network in the photoautotroph Synechocystis with that of the heterotroph E. coli using the novel workflow POPPY (Prospecting Optimal Pathways with PYthon). First, E. coli and Synechocystis metabolomic and fluxomic data were combined with metabolic models to identify thermodynamic constraints on metabolite concentrations (NET analysis). Then, thousands of automatically constructed pathways were placed within each network and subjected to a network-embedded variant of the max-min driving force analysis (NEM). We found that the networks had different capabilities for imparting thermodynamic driving forces toward certain compounds. Key metabolites were constrained differently in Synechocystis due to opposing flux directions in glycolysis and carbon fixation, the forked tri-carboxylic acid cycle, and photorespiration. Furthermore, the lysine biosynthesis pathway in Synechocystis was identified as thermodynamically constrained, impacting both endogenous and heterologous reactions through low 2-oxoglutarate levels. Our study also identified important yet poorly covered areas in existing metabolomics data and provides a reference for future thermodynamics-based engineering in Synechocystis and beyond. The POPPY methodology represents a step in making optimal pathway-host matches, which is likely to become important as the practical range of host organisms is diversified.",

The pathway proceeds through the homoserine transaminase-catalyzed deamination of homoserine to obtain 2-oxo-4-hydroxybutyrate (OHB), and continues with the reduction of OHB to DHB, which is catalyzed by an OHB reductase enzyme. We identified homoserine transaminase and OHB reductase activity in several candidate enzymes which act on sterically cognate substrates, and improved OHB reductase activity of lactate dehydrogenase A of Lactococcus lactis by structure-based enzyme engineering.

     "abstract": "Mandelic acid (MA) and 4-hydroxymandelic acid (HMA) are valuable specialty chemicals used as precursors for flavors as well as for cosmetic and pharmaceutical purposes. Today they are mainly synthesized chemically. Their synthesis through microbial fermentation would allow for environmentally sustainable production. In this work, we engineered the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for high-level production of MA and HMA. Expressing the hydroxymandelate synthase from Amycolatopsis orientalis in a yeast wild type strain resulted in the production of 119 mg/L HMA from glucose. As the enzyme also accepts phenylpyruvate as a substrate aside from its native substrate 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, 0.7 mg/L MA was also produced. Preventing binding of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to the hydroxymandelate synthase by introducing a S201V replacement in its substrate binding site nearly completely prevented HMA production but increased MA production only 3.5-fold. To further increase HMA and MA production, the aromatic amino acid pathway was engineered. We increased the precursor supply by introducing modifications in the shikimic acid pathway (ARO1↑, ARO3K222L↑, ARO4K220L↑) and reducing flux into the Ehrlich pathway (aro10Δ), and thereby enhanced the HMA titer to 465 mg/L and the MA titer to 2.9 mg/L. A further increase in HMA and MA titers was achieved by replacing the hydroxymandelate synthase from A. orientalis with the corresponding enzyme from Nocardia uniformis. Subsequently, we introduced additional deletions to block the competing tryptophan branch (trp2Δ), to further decrease flux into the Ehrlich pathway (pdc5Δ) and to avoid transamination of phenylpyruvate and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (aro8Δ, aro9Δ). We achieved more than 1 g/L 4-hydroxymandelate when additionally preventing formation of phenylpyruvate by deleting PHA2. When deleting TYR1 to prevent formation of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate instead, an MA titer of 236 mg/L was achieved. This is a more than 200-fold increase in MA production compared to the wild type strain expressing the hydroxymandelate synthase from A. orientalis. Finally, we showed that S. cerevisiae tolerates HMA and MA to concentrations as high as 3 g/L and 7.5 g/L, respectively. Our results demonstrate that S. cerevisiae is a promising host for sustainable MA and HMA production.",

In the absence of a comprehensive commercially available deletion collection in a wine yeast background, a screening approach was applied to a transposon library in a wine yeast derivative to identify clones with superior fermentation performance. Five candidate genes, when disrupted by Ty insertion, were identified as enabling yeast to efficiently complete a model oenological fermentation with limited nitrogen availability. Analogous single gene disruptions were subsequently constructed in the haploid wine yeast strain C911D, and the performance of these during fermentation was analysed. Deletion of ECM33 resulted in the shortest fermentation (up to 31% reduction) in both synthetic medium and grape juice. Interestingly, no significant differences were found in nitrogen utilization, cell viability or biomass yield between ∆ecm33 and the wild type. ∆ecm33 did, however, display growth hypersensitivity to the dyes Calcofluor White and Congo Red, suggesting a link to cell wall integrity. Transcriptional profiling of ∆ecm33 during fermentation demonstrated the up-regulation of SLT2 and HOG1, encoding mitogen activated protein kinases involved in the cell wall integrity (CWI) and high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathways, respectively. CHS3 a major chitin synthase gene was also found to be upregulated, and the transcript abundance of key genes of central nitrogen metabolism, GLN1, GLT1, GDH1 and GDH2 in mutant ∆ecm33 were also altered.

Here, we discuss selected classes of fungal enzymes that are currently in biotechnological use, and explore more basal, non-conventional fungi and their underexploited biomass-degrading mechanisms as promising agents in the transition towards a bio-based society. Of special interest are anaerobic fungi like the Neocallimastigomycota, which were recently found to harbor the largest diversity of biomass-degrading enzymes among the fungal kingdom. Enzymes sourced from these basal fungi have been used to metabolically engineer substrate utilization in yeast, and may offer new paths to lignin breakdown and tunneled biocatalysis. We also contrast classic enzymology approaches with emerging ‘omics’-based tools to decipher function within novel fungal isolates and identify new promising enzymes. Recent developments in genome editing are expected to accelerate discovery and metabolic engineering within these systems, yet are still limited by a lack of high-resolution genomes, gene regulatory regions, and even appropriate culture conditions. Finally, we present new opportunities to harness the biomass-degrading potential of undercharacterized fungi via heterologous expression and engineered microbial consortia.",

Although historically overlooked and underappreciated, such metabolite damage reactions are now known to occur throughout metabolism and to generate (formerly enigmatic) peaks detected in metabolomics datasets. It is also now known that metabolite damage is often countered by dedicated repair enzymes that undo or prevent it. Metabolite damage and repair are highly relevant to engineered pathway design: metabolite damage reactions can reduce flux rates and product yields, and repair enzymes can provide robust, host-independent solutions. Herein, after introducing the core principles of metabolite damage and repair, we use case histories to document how damage and repair processes affect efficient operation of engineered pathways – particularly those that are heterologous, non-natural, or cell-free. We then review how metabolite damage reactions can be predicted, how repair reactions can be prospected, and how metabolite damage and repair can be built into genome-scale metabolic models. Lastly, we propose a versatile ‘plug and play’ set of well-characterized metabolite repair enzymes to solve metabolite damage problems known or likely to occur in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology projects.",

Centering around malonyl-CoA, we summarized here the various metabolic engineering strategies employed recently to regulate and control malonyl-CoA metabolism and improve cellular productivity. Effective metabolic engineering of microorganisms requires the introduction of heterologous pathways and dynamically rerouting metabolic flux towards products of interest. Transcriptional factor-based biosensors translate an internal cellular signal to a transcriptional output and drive the expression of the designed genetic/biomolecular circuits to compensate the activity loss of the engineered biosystem. Recent development of genetically-encoded malonyl-CoA sensor has stood out as a classical example to dynamically reprogram cell metabolism for various biotechnological applications. Here, we reviewed the design principles of constructing a transcriptional factor-based malonyl-CoA sensor with superior detection limit, high sensitivity and broad dynamic range. We discussed various synthetic biology strategies to remove pathway bottleneck and how genetically-encoded metabolite sensor could be deployed to improve pathway efficiency. Particularly, we emphasized that integration of malonyl-CoA sensing capability with biocatalytic function would be critical to engineer efficient microbial cell factory. Biosensors have also advanced beyond its classical function of a sensor actuator for in situ monitoring of intracellular metabolite concentration. Applications of malonyl-CoA biosensors as a sensor-invertor for negative feedback regulation of metabolic flux, a metabolic switch for oscillatory balancing of malonyl-CoA sink pathway and source pathway and a screening tool for engineering more efficient biocatalyst are also presented in this review.

     "abstract": "Economically competitive microbial production of biorenewable fuels and chemicals is often impeded by toxicity of the product to the microbe. Membrane damage is often identified as a major mechanism of this toxicity. Prior efforts to strengthen the microbial membrane by changing the phospholipid distribution have largely focused on the fatty acid tails. Herein, a novel strategy of phospholipid head engineering is demonstrated in Escherichia coli. Specifically, increasing the expression of phosphatidylserine synthase (+pssA) was found to significantly increase both the tolerance and production of octanoic acid, a representative membrane-damaging solvent. Tolerance of other industrially-relevant inhibitors, such as furfural, acetate, toluene, ethanol and low pH was also increased. In addition to the increase in the relative abundance of the phosphoethanolamine (PE) head group in the +pssA strain, there were also changes in the fatty acid tail composition, resulting in an increase in average length, percent unsaturation and decreased abundance of cyclic rings. This +pssA strain had significant changes in: membrane integrity, surface potential, electrochemical potential and hydrophobicity; sensitivity to intracellular acidification; and distribution of the phospholipid tails, including an increase in average length and percent unsaturation and decreased abundance of cyclic rings. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the +PE membrane had increased resistance to penetration of ethanol into the hydrophobic core and also the membrane thickness. Further hybrid models in which only the head group distribution or fatty acid tail distribution was altered showed that the increase in PE content is responsible for the increase in bilayer thickness, but the increased hydrophobic core thickness is due to altered distribution of both the head groups and fatty acid tails. This work demonstrates the importance of consideration of the membrane head groups, as well as a modeling approach, in membrane engineering efforts.",

The strategy was applied on metabolically engineered Lactococcus lactis strains to optimize the production of acetoin and (R,R)-2,3-butanediol (R-BDO). In the absence of an external electron acceptor, a surplus of two NADH per acetoin molecule is produced. We found that a fully activated respiration was able to efficiently regenerate NAD+, and a high titer of 371 mM (32 g/L) of acetoin was obtained with a yield of 82% of the theoretical maximum. Subsequently, we extended the metabolic pathway from acetoin to R-BDO by introducing the butanediol dehydrogenase gene from Bacillus subtilis. Since one mole of NADH is consumed when acetoin is converted into R-BDO per mole, only the excess of NADH needs to be oxidized via respiration. Either by fine-tuning the respiration capacity or by using a dual-phase fermentation approach involving a switch from fully respiratory to non-respiratory conditions, we obtained 361 mM (32 g/L) R-BDO with a yield of 81% or 365 mM (33 g/L) with a yield of 82%, respectively.

     "abstract": "Primordial enzymes are proposed to possess broad specificities. Through divergence and evolution, enzymes have been refined to exhibit specificity towards one reaction or substrate, and are thus commonly assumed as “specialists”. However, some enzymes are “generalists” that catalyze a range of substrates and reactions. This property has been defined as enzyme promiscuity and is of great importance for the evolution of new functions. The promiscuities of two enzymes, namely glycerol dehydratase and diol dehydratase, were herein exploited for catalyzing long-chain polyols, including 1,2-butanediol, 1,2,4-butanetriol, erythritol, 1,2-pentanediol, 1,2,5-pentanetriol, and 1,2,6-hexanetriol. The specific activities required for catalyzing these six long-chain polyols were studied via in vitro enzyme assays, and the catalytic efficiencies were increased through protein engineering. The promiscuous functions were subsequently applied in vivo to establish 1,4-butanediol pathways from lignocellulose derived compounds, including xylose and erythritol. In addition, a pathway for 1-pentanol production from 1,2-pentanediol was also constructed. The results suggest that exploiting enzyme promiscuity is promising for exploring new catalysts, which would expand the repertoire of genetic elements available to synthetic biology and may provide a starting point for designing and engineering novel pathways for valuable chemicals.",

Production based screening identified a microbial O-ATF from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a plant N-ATF from Capsicum annuum capable of forming caffeic acid derived esters and amides, respectively. Subsequent combinatorial incorporation of caffeic acid with various aromatic alcohol or amine biosynthetic pathways permitted the de novo bacterial production of a panel of caffeic acid derived phenethyl esters or amides in Escherichia coli for the first time.

It has been applied previously to Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 during aerobic exponential growth on glucose minimal media, a frequently used model organism and growth condition, to probe the limits of E. coli growth rate and gain insights into fast growth phenotypes. Previous studies have described up to 1.6-fold increases in growth rate following ALE, and have identified key causal genetic mutations and changes in transcriptional patterns. Here, we report for the first time intracellular metabolic fluxes for six such adaptively evolved strains, as determined by high-resolution 13C-metabolic flux analysis. Interestingly, we found that intracellular metabolic pathway usage changed very little following adaptive evolution. Instead, at the level of central carbon metabolism the faster growth was facilitated by proportional increases in glucose uptake and all intracellular rates. Of the six evolved strains studied here, only one strain showed a small degree of flux rewiring, and this was also the strain with unique genetic mutations. A comparison of fluxes with two other wild-type (unevolved) E. coli strains, BW25113 and BL21, showed that inter-strain differences are greater than differences between the parental and evolved strains. Principal component analysis highlighted that nearly all flux differences (95%) between the nine strains were captured by only two principal components. The distance between measured and flux balance analysis predicted fluxes was also investigated. It suggested a relatively wide range of similar stoichiometric optima, which opens new questions about the path-dependency of adaptive evolution.",

     "abstract": "Photosynthesis drives the production of ATP and NADPH, and acts as a source of carbon for primary metabolism. NADPH is also used in the production of many natural bioactive compounds. These are usually synthesized in low quantities and are often difficult to produce by chemical synthesis due to their complex structures. Some of the crucial enzymes catalyzing their biosynthesis are the cytochromes P450 (P450s) situated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), powered by electron transfers from NADPH. Dhurrin is a cyanogenic glucoside and its biosynthesis involves a dynamic metabolon formed by two P450s, a UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT) and a P450 oxidoreductase (POR). Its biosynthetic pathway has been relocated to the chloroplast where ferredoxin, reduced through the photosynthetic electron transport chain, serves as an efficient electron donor to the P450s, bypassing the involvement of POR. Nevertheless, translocation of the pathway from the ER to the chloroplast creates other difficulties, such as the loss of metabolon formation and intermediate diversion into other metabolic pathways. We show here that co-localization of these enzymes in the thylakoid membrane leads to a significant increase in product formation, with a concomitant decrease in off-pathway intermediates. This was achieved by exchanging the membrane anchors of the dhurrin pathway enzymes to components of the Twin-arginine translocation pathway, TatB and TatC, which have self-assembly properties. Consequently, we show 5-fold increased titers of dhurrin and a decrease in the amounts of intermediates and side products in Nicotiana benthamiana. Further, results suggest that targeting the UGT to the membrane is a key factor to achieve efficient substrate channeling.",

In this study, we identified and engineered the determinants of biocatalytic selectivity which control flux towards the iridoid scaffold from which all MIAs are derived. Development of a bioconversion based production platform enabled analysis of the metabolic flux and interference around two critical steps in generating the iridoid scaffold: oxidation of 8-hydroxygeraniol to the dialdehyde 8-oxogeranial followed by reductive cyclization to form nepetalactol. In vitro reconstitution of previously uncharacterized shunt pathways enabled the identification of two distinct routes to a reduced shunt product including endogenous ‘ene’-reduction and non-productive reduction by iridoid synthase when interfaced with endogenous alcohol dehydrogenases. Deletion of five genes involved in α,β-unsaturated carbonyl metabolism resulted in a 5.2-fold increase in biocatalytic selectivity of the desired iridoid over reduced shunt product.

The fed-batch process achieved significantly higher specific productivity, approximately 60% greater than the perfusion process. In spite of this, a general lack of difference was observed when globally comparing glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and TCA cycle fluxes. In contrast, gross growth rate was significantly different, approximately 80% greater in the perfusion process. This difference was concealed by a significantly greater death rate in the perfusion process, such that net growth rates were both similar and near-zero. When considering gross growth rate and IgG specific productivity, total protein specific productivity (Biomass+ IgG) differed little, offering rationale for the observed central carbon pathway similarities. Significant differences were identified in anaplerotic branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) contributions by 13C-MFA.

To alleviate this shortcoming, a cofactor self-sufficient system was developed for enhanced production of 2-phenylethanol (2-PE) in E. coli. A “bridge” between the amino acid and its corresponding alcohol was designed in the system using glutamate dehydrogenase. By coupling glutamate dehydrogenase with transaminase and alcohol dehydrogenase, the cosubstrate (2-oxoglutarate) and redox equivalents (NAD(P)H) were regenerated simultaneously, so that no external cofactor or redox source was required. Thus, a cofactor self-sufficient system was developed, which improved the biocatalyst efficiency 3.8-fold. The ammonium generated in this process was removed using zeolite, which further improved the biosynthetic efficiency and resulted in a cleaner system. To the best of our knowledge, this system yielded the highest titer of 2-PE ever obtained in E. coli. Additionally, the wider applicability of this self-sufficient strategy was demonstrated in the production of D-phenyllactic acid. This study thus offers a new method to resolve the cofactor/redox imbalance problem and demonstrates the feasibility of the cofactor self-sufficient strategy for enhanced production of diverse chemicals.",

While testing large numbers of compounds may be impractical, computational approaches can exploit existing data to determine the most informative substrates to test next, thereby more thoroughly exploring an enzyme's versatility. To demonstrate this, we used existing studies and tested compounds for four different enzymes, developed support vector machine (SVM) models using these datasets, and selected additional compounds for experiments using an active learning approach. SVMs trained on a chemically diverse set of compounds were discovered to achieve maximum accuracies of ~80% using ~33% fewer compounds than datasets based on all compounds tested in existing studies. Active learning-selected compounds for testing resolved apparent conflicts in the existing training data, while adding diversity to the dataset. The application of these algorithms to wide arrays of metabolic enzymes would result in a library of SVMs that can predict high-probability promiscuous enzymatic reactions and could prove a valuable resource for the design of novel metabolic pathways.",

Overall, we found that the metabolisms of the three thermophiles were highly distinct, suggesting that adaptation to growth at high temperatures did not favor any particular set of metabolic pathways. All three strains relied heavily on glycolysis and TCA cycle to generate key cellular precursors and cofactors. None of the investigated organisms utilized the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and only one strain had an active oxidative pentose phosphate pathway.

It is mainly produced from glucose, using microbial fermentation. Here, we explore and optimize succinate production from sucrose, a globally applied substrate in biotechnology, using the rumen bacterium Basfia succiniciproducens DD1. As basis of the strain optimization, the yet unknown sucrose metabolism of the microbe was studied, using 13C metabolic flux analyses. When grown in batch culture on sucrose, the bacterium exhibited a high succinate yield of 1 mol mol−1 and a by-product spectrum, which did not match the expected PTS-mediated sucrose catabolism. This led to the discovery of a fructokinase, involved in sucrose catabolism. The flux approach unraveled that the fructokinase and the fructose PTS both contribute to phosphorylation of the fructose part of sucrose. The contribution of the fructokinase reduces the undesired loss of the succinate precursor PEP into pyruvate and into pyruvate-derived by-products and enables increased succinate production, exclusively via the reductive TCA cycle branch. These findings were used to design superior producers. Mutants, which (i) overexpress the beneficial fructokinase, (II) lack the competing fructose PTS, and (iii) combine both traits, produce significantly more succinate.

A compound whose biotechnological production might greatly profit from the substrate's higher reducing power is 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO). Here we present a novel metabolic engineering approach to produce 1,2-PDO from glycerol in S. cerevisiae. Apart from implementing the heterologous methylglyoxal (MG) pathway for 1,2-PDO formation from dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and expressing a heterologous glycerol facilitator, the employed genetic modifications included the replacement of the native FAD-dependent glycerol catabolic pathway by the 'DHA pathway' for delivery of cytosolic NADH and the reduction of triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) activity for increased precursor (DHAP) supply. The choice of the medium had a crucial impact on both the strength of the metabolic switch towards fermentation in general (as indicated by the production of ethanol and 1,2-PDO) and on the ratio at which these two fermentation products were formed. For example, virtually no 1,2-PDO but only ethanol was formed in synthetic glycerol medium with urea as the nitrogen source. When nutrient-limited complex YG medium was used, significant amounts of 1,2-PDO were formed and it became obvious that the concerted supply of NADH and DHAP are essential for boosting 1,2-PDO production. Additionally, optimizing the flux into the MG pathway improved 1,2-PDO formation at the expense of ethanol. Cultivation of the best-performing strain in YG medium and a controlled bioreactor set-up resulted in a maximum titer of > 4 g L−1 1,2-PDO which, to the best of our knowledge, has been the highest titer of 1,2-PDO obtained in yeast so far. Surprisingly, significant 1,2-PDO production was also obtained in synthetic glycerol medium after changing the nitrogen source towards ammonium sulfate and adding a buffer.",

In contrast to industrial hydrolysis of starch to glucose, an alternative ATP-free phosphorylation of starch was designed to generate cost-effective glucose 6-phosphate by using five thermophilic enzymes (i.e., isoamylase, alpha-glucan phosphorylase, 4-α-glucanotransferase, phosphoglucomutase, and polyphosphate glucokinase). This enzymatic phosphorolysis is energetically advantageous because the energy of α-1,4-glycosidic bonds among anhydroglucose units is conserved in the form of phosphorylated glucose. Furthermore, we demonstrated an in vitro 17-thermophilic enzyme pathway that can convert all glucose units of starch, regardless of branched and linear contents, with water to hydrogen at a theoretic yield (i.e., 12 H2 per glucose), three times of the theoretical yield from dark microbial fermentation. The use of a biomimetic electron transport chain enabled to achieve a maximum volumetric productivity of 90.2 mmol of H2/L/h at 20 g/L starch. The complete oxidation of starch to hydrogen by this in vitro synthetic (enzymatic) biosystem suggests that starch as a natural solar fuel becomes a high-density hydrogen storage compound with a gravimetric density of more than 14% H2-based mass and an electricity density of more than 3000 W h/kg of starch.",

Here we aimed to study how production of p-coumaric acid, a precursor of multiple secondary aromatic metabolites, influences the cellular metabolism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We evaluated the growth and p-coumaric acid production in batch and chemostat cultivations and analyzed the transcriptome and intracellular metabolome during steady state in low- and high-producers of p-coumaric acid in two strain backgrounds, S288c or CEN.PK.We found that the same genetic modifications resulted in higher production of p-coumaric acid in the CEN.PK background than in the S288c background. Moreover, the CEN.PK strain was less affected by the genetic engineering as was evident from fewer changes in the transcription profile and intracellular metabolites concentrations. Surprisingly, for both strains we found the largest transcriptional changes in genes involved in transport of amino acids and sugars, which were downregulated. Additionally, in S288c amino acid and protein biosynthesis processes were also affected.We systematically overexpressed or deleted genes with significant transcriptional changes in CEN.PK low and high-producing strains. The knockout of some of the downregulated transporters triggered a 20–50% improvement in the synthesis of p-CA in the CEN.PK high-producing strain. This study demonstrates the importance of transporters in the engineering of cell factories for production of small molecules.",

We found that heterologous expression of a lysine transporter was required to excrete lysine and avoid intracellular accumulation that correlated with poor fitness. Simultaneous expression of a feedback inhibition resistant aspartate kinase and lysine transporter were sufficient for high productivities, but this was also met with a decreased chlorophyll content and reduced growth rates. Increasing the reductant supply by using NH4+, a more reduced nitrogen source relative to NO3-, resulted in a two-fold increase in productivity directing 18% of fixed carbon to lysine. Given this advantage, we demonstrated lysine production from media formulated with a municipal wastewater treatment sidestream as a nutrient source for increased economic and environmental sustainability. Based on our results, we project that Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 could produce lysine at areal productivities approaching that of sugar cane to lysine via fermentation using non-agricultural lands and low-cost feedstocks.",

     "abstract": "Biotechnological production of butanol in heterologous hosts has recently attracted many interests. Of the heterologous hosts investigated to date, engineered Escherichia coli has shown a superior butanol yield than the natural butanol-producing clostridial strains. However, all reported butanol-producing E. coli strains contain vectors and inducible promoters, which means antibiotics and inducers are required in the fermentation. The aim of this study was to develop a completely chromosomally engineered E. coli strain capable of producing butanol efficiently in the absence of vectors, antibiotics, and inducers. The challenges are the expression strength of chromosomally engineered genes under constitutive promoters is much weaker than the vector engineered genes under inducible promoters. To address these challenges, the butanol pathway was engineered into the chromosome in the first place, then the host and the butanol pathway was iteratively engineered through rational and non-rational strategies to develop an efficient butanol producer where the heterologous butanol pathway fits the host well. Finally, a systematically chromosomally engineered E. coli strain EB243, in which 33 native genes were deleted and 5 heterologous genes were introduced, was developed. Strain EB243 could produce 20 g/L butanol with a yield of 34% (w/w, 83% of theoretical yield) in batch fermentation without any antibiotics and inducers, thus showed great potential for industrial application.

     "abstract": "Isobutanol and other branched-chain higher alcohols (BCHAs) are promising advanced biofuels derived from the degradation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a particularly attractive host for the production of BCHAs due to its high tolerance to alcohols and prevalent use in the bioethanol industry. Degradation of BCAAs begins with transamination reactions, catalyzed by branched-chain amino acid transaminases (BCATs) located in the mitochondria (Bat1p) and cytosol (Bat2p). However, the roles that these transaminases play in isobutanol production remain poorly understood and obscured by conflicting reports in the literature. In this work, we elucidate the influence of BCATs on isobutanol production in two genetic backgrounds (CEN.PK2-1C and BY4741). In the process, we uncover and characterize two competing isobutanol pathways, which can be manipulated by overexpressing or deleting BAT1 or BAT2, and adding or removing valine from the fermentation media. We show that deletion of BAT1 alone increases isobutanol production by 14.2-fold over wild type strains in media lacking valine, and examine how interactions between valine and the regulatory protein Ilv6p affect isobutanol production. Compartmentalizing the five-gene isobutanol biosynthetic pathway in mitochondria of BAT1 deletion strains results in an additional 2.1-fold increase in isobutanol production in the absence of valine. While valine inhibits isobutanol production, it boosts 2-methyl-1-butanol production. This work clarifies the role of transamination activity in BCHA biosynthesis, and develops valuable strategies and strains for future optimization of isobutanol production.",

However, the redox cofactor requirement for the efficient operation of r-BOX remains unclear. In this work, the metabolic efficiency of r-BOX for medium-chain fatty acid (C6-C10, MCFA) production was optimized by redox cofactor engineering. Stoichiometric analysis of the r-BOX pathway and further experimental examination identified NADH as a crucial determinant of r-BOX process yield. Furthermore, the introduction of formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii using fermentative inhibitor byproduct formate as a redox NADH sink improved MCFA titer from initial 1.2 g/L to 3.1 g/L. Moreover, coupling of increasing the supply of acetyl-CoA with NADH to achieve fermentative redox balance enabled product synthesis at maximum titers. To this end, the acetate re-assimilation pathway was further optimized to increase acetyl-CoA availability associated with the new supply of NADH. It was found that the acetyl-CoA synthetase activity and intracellular ATP levels constrained the activity of acetate re-assimilation pathway, and 4.7 g/L of MCFA titer was finally achieved after alleviating these two limiting factors. To the best of our knowledge, this represented the highest titer reported to date. These results demonstrated that the key constraint of r-BOX was redox imbalance and redox engineering could further unleash the lipogenic potential of this cycle. The redox engineering strategies could be applied to acetyl-CoA-derived products or other bio-products requiring multiple redox cofactors for biosynthesis.",

Quorum sensing (QS) systems in bacteria control gene expression in response to population density, and the LuxI/R system from Vibrio fischeri is a well-studied example. A QS system could be ideal for biofuel production strains as it is self-regulated and does not require the addition of inducer compounds, which reduce operational costs for inducer. In this study, a QS system was developed for inducer-free production of the biofuel compound bisabolene from engineered E. coli. Seven variants of the Sensor plasmid, which carry the luxI-luxR genes, and four variants of the Response plasmid, which carry bisabolene producing pathway genes under the control of the PluxI promoter, were designed for optimization of bisabolene production. Furthermore, a chromosome-integrated QS strain was engineered with the best combination of Sensor and Response plasmid and produced bisabolene at a titer of 1.1 g/L without addition of external inducers. This is a 44% improvement from our previous inducible system. The QS strain also displayed higher homogeneity in gene expression and isoprenoid production compared to an inducible-system strain.",

It has successfully been applied to many microorganisms and is now used to study cancer metabolism. Generic models of human metabolism have been reconstructed based on the existence of metabolic genes in the human genome. Cancer specific models of metabolism have also been generated by reducing the number of reactions in the generic model based on high throughput expression data, e.g. transcriptomics and proteomics. Targets for drugs and bio markers for diagnostics have been identified using these models. They have also been used as scaffolds for analysis of high throughput data to allow mechanistic interpretation of changes in expression. Finally, GEMs allow quantitative flux predictions using flux balance analysis (FBA).

     "abstract": "Model-based metabolic flux analysis (MFA) using isotope-labeled substrates has provided great insight into intracellular metabolic activities across a host of organisms. One challenge with applying MFA in mammalian systems, however, is the need for absolute quantification of nutrient uptake, biomass composition, and byproduct release fluxes. Such measurements are often not feasible in complex culture systems or in vivo. One way to address this issue is to estimate flux ratios, the fractional contribution of a flux to a metabolite pool, which are independent of absolute measurements and yet informative for cellular metabolism. Prior work has focused on “local” estimation of a handful of flux ratios for specific metabolites and reactions. Here, we perform systematic, model-based estimation of all flux ratios in a metabolic network using isotope labeling data, in the absence of uptake/release data. In a series of examples, we investigate what flux ratios can be well estimated with reasonably tight confidence intervals, and contrast this with confidence intervals on normalized fluxes. We find that flux ratios can provide useful information on the metabolic state, and is complementary to normalized fluxes: for certain metabolic reactions, only flux ratios can be well estimated, while for others normalized fluxes can be obtained. Simulation studies of a large human metabolic network model suggest that estimation of flux ratios is technically feasible for complex networks, but additional studies on data from actual isotopomer labeling experiments are needed to validate these results. Finally, we experimentally study serine and methionine metabolism in cancer cells using flux ratios. We find that, in these cells, the methionine cycle is truncated with little remethylation from homocysteine, and polyamine synthesis in the absence of methionine salvage leads to loss of 5-methylthioadenosine, suggesting a new mode of overflow metabolism in cancer cells. This work highlights the potential for flux ratio analysis in the absence of absolute quantification, which we anticipate will be important for both in vitro and in vivo studies of cancer metabolism.",

Extracellular vesicles such as exosomes, transport proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, to mediate intercellular communication between TME components and have emerged as candidates for anti-cancer therapy. We previously reported that cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) derived exosomes (CDEs) contain metabolites in their cargo that are utilized by cancer cells for central carbon metabolism and promote cancer growth. However, the metabolic fluxes involved in donor cells towards packaging of metabolites in extracellular vesicles and exosome-mediated metabolite flux upregulation in recipient cells are still not known. Here, we have developed a novel empirical and computational technique, exosome-mediated metabolic flux analysis (Exo-MFA) to quantify flow of cargo from source cells to recipient cells via vesicular transport. Our algorithm, which is based on 13C metabolic flux analysis, successfully predicts packaging fluxes to metabolite cargo in CAFs, dynamic changes in rate of exosome internalization by cancer cells, and flux of cargo release over time. We find that cancer cells internalize exosomes rapidly leading to depletion of extracellular exosomes within 24 h. However, metabolite cargo significantly alters intracellular metabolism over the course of 24 h by regulating glycolysis pathway fluxes via lactate supply. Furthermore, it can supply up to 35% of the TCA cycle fluxes by providing TCA intermediates and glutamine. Our algorithm will help gain insight into (i) metabolic interactions in multicellular systems (ii) biogenesis of extracellular vesicles and their differential packaging of cargo under changing environments, and (iii) regulation of cancer cell metabolism by its microenvironment.",

Such characteristic metabolome profiles were reproducible across different laboratories and experiments and exhibited mild to robust changes with change in experimental conditions. To extract a functional overview of cell line heterogeneity, we devised an unsupervised metabotyping procedure that for each pathway automatically recognized metabolic types from metabolome data and assigned cell lines. Our procedure provided a condensed yet global representation of cell line metabolism, revealing the fine structure of metabolic heterogeneity across all tested pathways and cell lines. In follow-up experiments on selected pathways, we confirmed that different metabolic types correlated to differences in the underlying fluxes and difference sensitivity to gene knockdown or pharmacological inhibition. Thus, the identified metabotypes recapitulated functional differences at the pathway level.

We addressed this question by decoupling loss of SDH and complex I activity in cancer cells and neurons. We found that sole loss of SDH activity was not sufficient to recapitulate the metabolic phenotype of SDH mutant tumors, because it failed to decrease mitochondrial respiration and to activate reductive glutamine metabolism.

     "abstract": "The mitochondrial citrate transport protein (CTP), encoded by SLC25A1, accommodates bidirectional trafficking of citrate between the mitochondria and cytosol, supporting lipid biosynthesis and redox homeostasis. Genetic CTP deficiency causes a fatal neurodevelopmental syndrome associated with the accumulation of L- and D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid, and elevated CTP expression is associated with poor prognosis in several types of cancer, emphasizing the importance of this transporter in multiple human pathologies. Here we describe the metabolic consequences of CTP deficiency in cancer cells. As expected from the phenotype of CTP-deficient humans, somatic CTP loss in cancer cells induces broad dysregulation of mitochondrial metabolism, resulting in accumulation of lactate and of the L- and D- enantiomers of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) and depletion of TCA cycle intermediates. It also eliminates mitochondrial import of citrate from the cytosol. To quantify the impact of CTP deficiency on metabolic flux, cells were cultured with a set of 13C-glucose and 13C-glutamine tracers with resulting data integrated by metabolic flux analysis (MFA). CTP-deficient cells displayed a major restructuring of central carbon metabolism, including suppression of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and induction of glucose-dependent anaplerosis through pyruvate carboxylase (PC). We also observed an unusual lipogenic pathway in which carbon from glucose supplies mitochondrial production of alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG), which is then trafficked to the cytosol and used to supply reductive carboxylation by isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1). The resulting citrate is cleaved to produce lipogenic acetyl-CoA, thereby completing a novel pathway of glucose-dependent reductive carboxylation. In CTP deficient cells, IDH1 inhibition suppresses lipogenesis from either glucose or glutamine, implicating IDH1 as a required component of fatty acid synthesis in states of CTP deficiency.",

Tumor cells deficient in LKB1 may be uniquely sensitized to metabolic stresses, which may offer a therapeutic window in oncology. To address this question we have explored how functional LKB1 impacts the metabolism of NSCLC cells using 13C metabolic flux analysis. Isogenic NSCLC cells expressing functional LKB1 exhibited higher flux through oxidative mitochondrial pathways compared to those deficient in LKB1. Re-expression of LKB1 also increased the capacity of cells to oxidize major mitochondrial substrates, including pyruvate, fatty acids, and glutamine. Furthermore, LKB1 expression promoted an adaptive response to energy stress induced by anchorage-independent growth. Finally, this diminished adaptability sensitized LKB1-deficient cells to combinatorial inhibition of mitochondrial complex I and glutaminase. Together, our data implicate LKB1 as a major regulator of adaptive metabolic reprogramming and suggest synergistic pharmacological strategies for mitigating LKB1-deficient NSCLC tumor growth.",

The aim of this study was precise carbon flux optimization for high ALA production in Escherichia coli expressing the ALA biosynthetic pathway. Initially, genes hemA and hemL were overexpressed with strong promoters and synthetic 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTRs). Then, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was blocked to force carbon flux toward the ALA production pathway by deletion of sucA. Although the resulting strain showed a severe metabolic imbalance and low ALA production, further precise tuning of carbon flux to the glyoxylate cycle by varying the transcriptional strength of aceA led to substantially improved cell growth and ALA production.

Importantly, the glycan structure of a therapeutic protein influences its efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity. In this work, we developed glycosylation flux analysis (GFA) for predicting intracellular production and consumption rates (fluxes) of glycoforms, and applied this analysis to CHO fed-batch immunoglobulin G (IgG) production using two different media compositions, with and without additional manganese feeding. The GFA is based on a constraint-based modeling of the glycosylation network, employing a pseudo steady state assumption. While the glycosylation fluxes in the network are balanced at each time point, the GFA allows the fluxes to vary with time by way of two scaling factors: (1) an enzyme-specific factor that captures the temporal changes among glycosylation reactions catalysed by the same enzyme, and (2) the cell specific productivity factor that accounts for the dynamic changes in the IgG production rate. The GFA of the CHO fed-batch cultivations showed that regardless of the media composition, galactosylation fluxes decreased with the cultivation time more significantly than the other glycosylation reactions. Furthermore, the GFA showed that the addition of Mn, a cofactor of galactosyltransferase, has the effect of increasing the galactosylation fluxes but only during the beginning of the cultivation period. The results thus demonstrated the power of the GFA in delineating the dynamic alterations of the glycosylation fluxes by local (enzyme-specific) and global (cell specific productivity) factors.",

In this work, the CRISPR/Cas9-facilitated multiplex pathway optimization (CFPO) technique was developed to simultaneously modulate the expression of multiple genes on the chromosome. To implement it, two plasmids were employed to target Cas9 to regulatory sequences of pathway genes, and a donor DNA plasmid library was constructed containing a regulator pool to modulate the expression of these genes. A modularized plasmid construction strategy was used to enable the assembly of a complex donor DNA plasmid library. After genome editing using this technique, a combinatorial library was obtained with variably expressed pathway genes. As a demonstration, the CFPO technique was applied to the xylose metabolic pathway genes in E. coli to improve xylose utilization. Three transcriptional units containing a total of four genes were modulated simultaneously with 70% efficiency, and improved strains were selected from the resulting combinatorial library by growth enrichment.

However, full repression of pigment production when undesired is challenging, as even small amounts of enzyme can catalyze the production of large, visible amounts of pigment. The red pigment lycopene could be particularly useful because of its position in the multi-pigment carotenoid pathway, but commonly used inducible promoter systems cannot repress lycopene production. In this paper, we designed a system that could fully repress lycopene production in the absence of an inducer and produce visible lycopene within two hours of induction. We engineered Lac, Ara, and T7 systems to be up to 10 times more repressible, but these improved systems could still not fully repress lycopene. Translational modifications proved much more effective in controlling lycopene. By decreasing the strength of the ribosomal binding sites on the crtEBI genes, we enabled full repression of lycopene and production of visible lycopene in 3–4 h of induction. Finally, we added the mevalonate pathway enzymes to increase the rate of lycopene production upon induction and demonstrated that supplementation of metabolic precursors could decrease the time to coloration to about 1.5 h. In total, this represents over an order of magnitude reduction in response time compared to the previously reported strategy. The approaches used here demonstrate the disconnect between fluorescent and metabolite reporters, help enable the use of lycopene as a reporter, and are likely generalizable to other systems that require precise control of metabolite production.",

Herein, we demonstrated metabolic state switching from the cell growth mode based on the metabolic pathways of the wild type strain to a GABA production mode based on a synthetic metabolic pathway in Escherichia coli through rewriting of the metabolic regulatory network and pathway engineering. The GABA production mode was achieved by multiple strategies such as conditional interruption of the TCA and glyoxylate cycles, engineering of GABA production pathway including a bypass for precursor metabolite supply, and upregulation of GABA transporter.

Here, we demonstrate an improvement in α-ketoglutarate (AKG) production in S. cerevisiae using a novel approach based on synthetic rescue. Here, we first perturb the cytosolic NADPH metabolism via deletion of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (ZWF1). In parallel, we used a strain design algorithm to identify strategies for further improvement in AKG production. Implementation of the identified genetic targets, including disruption of succinyl-CoA Ligase (LSC2) and constitutive expression of NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDP1 and IDP2) resulted in more than 3 fold improvement in AKG production as compared to the wild type. Our results demonstrate this improvement is due to a synthetic rescue mechanism in which the metabolic flux was redirected towards AKG production through the manipulation of redox cofactors. Disrupting lsc2 in zwf1 mutant improved specific growth rate more than 15% as compared to the zwf1 mutant. In addition, our result suggests that cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDP2) may be regulated by isocitrate pools. Together, these results suggest the ability to improve metabolite production via a model guided synthetic rescue mechanism in S. cerevisiae and the potential for using IDP2 expression as a generalized strategy to effectively meet NADPH requirements in engineered strains.",

Here, we show that an isobutanol synthesis pathway exists naturally in Klebsiella pneumoniae; however, this pathway is dormant in the wild-type bacterium. K. pneumoniae is a 2,3-butanediol producer, and the synthesis pathways of 2,3-butanediol, valine and isobutanol all start from condensation of two pyruvate molecules to yield α-acetolactate. Inactivation of α-acetolactate decarboxylase (encoded by budA) resulted in α-acetolactate flowing into the valine pathway, which led to synthesis of isobutanol and 2-ketoisovalerate (a precursor of isobutanol). ldhA (lactate dehydrogenase) deletion further increased the isobutanol and 2-ketoisovalerate production. In the first step of this pathway, BudB (α-acetolactate synthase) was identified as responsible for most of the α-acetolactate synthesis. Complementation of ilvBN or ilvIH (isoenzymes of budB) both resulted in a remarkable increase in 2-ketoisovalerate production. Thus, α-acetolactate formation is the rate-limiting step of 2-ketoisovalerate production. ilvC (acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase) and ilvD (dihydroxy acid dehydratase) were identified responsible for 2-ketoisovalerate synthesis from α-acetolactate. ipdC, which encodes an indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase, was identified responsible for most of the isobutyraldehyde formation from 2-ketoisovalerate, and isobutanol production was increased 15.7 fold in the ipdC complementation strain, with a final titer of 2.45 g/L. Isobutanol dehydrogenase activity is distributed across multiple alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes expressed by K. pneumoniae. BudC, DhaT, DhaD and YqhD all had isobutanol dehydrogenase activity in vitro. YqhD uses NADPH as the coenzyme, while the other dehydrogenases use NADH. However, inactivating one or two of these dehydrogenases had no effect on isobutanol production in vivo with isobutyraldehyde as the substrate.

While various strategies have been applied to engineer β-carotene production in microbial cell factories, no work has been done to study and improve the storage of hydrophobic terpene products inside the heterologous host cells. Although the membrane is thought to be the cell compartment that accumulates hydrophobic terpenes such as β-carotene, direct evidence is still lacking. In this work, we engineered the membrane of Escherichia coli in both its morphological and biosynthetic aspects, as a means to study and improve its storage capacity for β-carotene. Engineering the membrane morphology by overexpressing membrane-bending proteins resulted in a 28% increase of β-carotene specific producton value, while engineering the membrane synthesis pathway led to a 43% increase. Moreover, the combination of these two strategies had a synergistic effect, which caused a 2.9-fold increase of β-carotene specific production value (from 6.7 to 19.6 mg/g DCW). Inward membrane stacks were observed in electron microscopy images of the engineered E. coli cells, which indicated that morphological changes were associated with the increased β-carotene storage capacity. Finally, membrane separation and analysis confirmed that the increased β-carotene was mainly accumulated within the cell membrane. This membrane engineering strategy was also applied to the β-carotene hyperproducing strain CAR025, which led to a 39% increase of the already high β-carotene specific production value (from 31.8 to 44.2 mg/g DCW in shake flasks), resulting in one of the highest reported specific production values under comparable culture conditions.

Each enzymatic step of a typical β-oxidation cycle is reversible, offering the possibility to also take advantage of reversed metabolic pathways for applied purposes. In such cases, 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolases, which catalyze the final chain-shortening step in the catabolic direction, mediate the condensation of an acyl-CoA starter molecule with acetyl-CoA in the anabolic direction. Subsequently, the carbonyl-group at C3 is stepwise reduced and dehydrated yielding a chain-elongated product.

     "abstract": "In natural habitats, microbes form multispecies communities that commonly face rapidly changing and highly competitive environments. Thus, phenotypic heterogeneity has evolved as an innate and important survival strategy to gain an overall fitness advantage over cohabiting competitors. However, in defined artificial environments such as monocultures in small- to large-scale bioreactors, cell-to-cell variations are presumed to cause reduced production yields as well as process instability. Hence, engineering microbial production toward phenotypic homogeneity is a highly promising approach for synthetic biology and bioprocess optimization.In this review, we discuss recent studies that have unraveled the cell-to-cell heterogeneity observed during bacterial gene expression and metabolite production as well as the molecular mechanisms involved. In addition, current single-cell technologies are briefly reviewed with respect to their applicability in exploring cell-to-cell variations. We highlight emerging strategies and tools to reduce phenotypic heterogeneity in biotechnological expression setups. Here, strain or inducer modifications are combined with cell physiology manipulations to achieve the ultimate goal of equalizing bacterial populations. In this way, the majority of cells can be forced into high productivity, thus reducing less productive subpopulations that tend to consume valuable resources during production. Modifications in uptake systems, inducer molecules or nutrients represent valuable tools for diminishing heterogeneity.Finally, we address the challenge of transferring homogeneously responding cells into large-scale bioprocesses. Environmental heterogeneity originating from extrinsic factors such as stirring speed and pH, oxygen, temperature or nutrient distribution can significantly influence cellular physiology. We conclude that engineering microbial populations toward phenotypic homogeneity is an increasingly important task to take biotechnological productions to the next level of control.",

Overexpression of pk in SA590 led to a significant improvement in IBA specific productivity. Single-gene overexpression of the three enzymes in the proposed PK bypass pathway also led to improvements in IBA production, although to a lesser extent than pk overexpression.

The best results were obtained using a mutant that overexpressed GUT1 and TKL1, which encode a glycerol kinase and a transketolase, respectively, and in which EYK1, which encodes erythrulose kinase, was disrupted; the latter enzyme is involved in an early step of erythritol catabolism. In this strain, erythritol productivity was 75% higher than in the wild type; furthermore, the culturing time needed to achieve maximum concentration was reduced by 40%. An additional advantage is that the strain was unable to consume the erythritol it had created, further increasing the process's efficiency. The erythritol productivity values we obtained here are among the highest reported thus far.",

Fermentative production of ginsenoside Rh2 in yeast has recently been investigated as an alternative strategy compared to extraction from plants.

Herein, we have demonstrated high-level production of ginsenoside Rh2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae via repurposing an inherently promiscuous glycosyltransferase, UGT51. The semi-rationally designed UGT51 presented an ~1800-fold enhanced catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for converting protopanaxadiol to ginsenoside Rh2 in vitro. Introducing the mutant glycosyltransferase gene into yeast increased Rh2 production from 0.0032 to 0.39 mg/g dry cell weight (DCW). Further metabolic engineering, including preventing Rh2 degradation and increasing UDP-glucose precursor supply, increased Rh2 production to 2.90 mg/g DCW, which was more than 900-fold higher than the starting strain. Finally, fed-batch fermentation in a 5-L bioreactor led to production of ~300 mg/L Rh2, which was the highest titer reported.",

Type I methanotrophs are gamma-proteobacterial methanotrophs using the ribulose monophosphate cycle (RuMP) cycle for methane assimilation. In order to facilitate metabolic engineering in the industrially promising Type I methanotroph Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1, flux analysis of cellular metabolism is needed and 13C tracer analysis is a foundational tool for such work. This biological system has a single-carbon input and a special network topology that together pose challenges to the current well-established methodology for 13C tracer analysis using a multi-carbon input such as glucose, and to date, no 13C tracer analysis of flux in a Type I methanotroph has been reported. In this study, we showed that by monitoring labeling patterns of several key intermediate metabolites in core metabolism, it is possible to quantitate the relative flux ratios for important branch points, such as the malate node. In addition, it is possible to assess the operation of the TCA cycle, which has been thought to be incomplete in Type I methanotrophs. Surprisingly, our analysis provides direct evidence of a complete, oxidative TCA cycle operating in M. buryatense 5GB1 using methane as sole carbon and energy substrate, contributing about 45% of the total flux for de novo malate production. Combined with mutant analysis, this method was able to identify fumA (METBUDRAFT_1453/MBURv2__60244) as the primary fumarase involved in the oxidative TCA cycle, among 2 predicted fumarases, supported by 13C tracer analysis on both fumA and fumC single knockouts. Interrupting the oxidative TCA cycle leads to a severe growth defect, suggesting that the oxidative TCA cycle functions to not only provide precursors for de novo biomass synthesis, but also to provide reducing power to the system.

     "abstract": "Arbutin is a hydroquinone glucoside compound existing in various plants. It is widely used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries owing to its well-known skin-lightening property as well as anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, and anti-inflammatory activities. Currently, arbutin is usually produced by plant extraction or enzymatic processes, which suffer from low product yield and expensive processing cost. In this work, we established an artificial pathway in Escherichia coli for high-level production of arbutin from simple carbon sources. First, a 4-hydroxybenzoate 1-hydroxylase from Candida parapsilosis CBS604 and a glucosyltransferase from Rauvolfia serpentina were characterized by in vitro enzyme assays. Introduction of these two genes into E. coli led to the production of 54.71 mg/L of arbutin from glucose. Further redirection of carbon flux into arbutin biosynthesis pathway by enhancing shikimate pathway genes enabled production of 3.29 g/L arbutin, which is a 60-fold increase compared with the initial strain. Final optimization of glucose concentration added in the culture medium was able to further improve the titer of arbutin to 4.19 g/L in shake flasks experiments, which is around 77-fold higher than that of initial strain. This work established de novo biosynthesis of arbutin from simple carbon sources and provided a generalizable strategy for the biosynthesis of shikimate pathway derived chemicals. The high titer achieved in our engineered strain also indicates the potential for industrial scale bio-manufacturing of arbutin.",

When these pathways are reconstituted in a heterologous microbial host for metabolic engineering purposes, the acyl-CoAs may be subject to undesirable hydrolysis by the host's native thioesterases, resulting in a waste of cellular energy and decreased intermediate availability, thus impairing bioconversion efficiency. 4-hydroxycoumarin (4HC) is a direct synthetic precursor to the commonly used oral anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) and rodenticides. In our previous study, we have established an artificial pathway for 4HC biosynthesis in Escherichia coli, which involves the thioester intermediate salicoyl-CoA. Here, we utilized the 4HC pathway as a demonstration to examine the negative effect of salicoyl-CoA degradaton, identify and inactivate the responsible thioesterase, and eventually improve the 4HC production. We screened a total of 16 E. coli thioesterases and tested their hydrolytic activity towards salicoyl-CoA in vitro. Among all the tested candidate enzymes, YdiI was found to be the dominant contributor to the salicoyl-CoA degradation in E. coli. Remarkably, the ydiI knockout strain carrying the 4HC pathway exhibited an up to 300% increase in 4HC production. An optimized 4HC pathway construct introduced in the ydiI knockout strain led to the accumulation of 935 mg/L of 4HC in shake flasks, which is about 1.5 folds higher than the wild-type strain. This study demonstrates a systematic strategy to alleviate the undesirable hydrolysis of thioester intermediates, allowing production enhancement for other biosynthetic pathways with similar issues.",

A toxic effect of isopropanol on the growth of C. necator has been indeed observed above a critical value of 15 g L−1. GroESL chaperones were first searched and identified in the genome of C. necator. Native groEL and groES genes from C. necator were over-expressed in a strain deleted for PHA synthesis. We demonstrated that over-expressing groESL genes led to a better tolerance of the strain towards exogenous isopropanol. GroESL genes were then over-expressed within the best engineered isopropanol producing strain. A final isopropanol concentration of 9.8 g L−1 was achieved in fed-batch culture on fructose as the sole carbon source (equivalent to 16 g L−1 after taking into account evaporation). Cell viability was slightly improved by the chaperone over-expression, particularly at the end of the fermentation when the isopropanol concentration was the highest. Moreover, the strain over-expressing the chaperones showed higher enzyme activity levels of the 2 heterologous enzymes (acetoacetate carboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase) of the isopropanol synthetic operon, translating to a higher specific production rate of isopropanol at the expense of the specific production rate of acetone. Over-expressing the native chaperones led to a 9–18% increase in the isopropanol yield on fructose.",

With the presence of ligands corresponding to the DNA aptamers, the expression of the target gene can be potentially enhanced at the transcriptional level by strengthening the recognition capability of RNAP to the recognition region and speeding up the separation efficiency of the unwinding region due to the induced DNA bubble around the thrombin-bound aptamers; while with the presence of RNA aptamer ligand, the gene expression can be repressed at the translational level by weakening the recognition capability of ribosome to RBS due to the shielding of RBS by the formed aptamer-ligand complex upstream RBS. The effectiveness and potential utility of the developed gene regulation system were demonstrated by regulating the expression of ecaA gene in the cell-free systems. The realistic metabolic engineering application of the system has also tested by regulating the expression of mgtC gene and thrombin cDNA in Escherichia coli JD1021 for controlling metabolic flux and improving thrombin production, verifying that the real-time control system of gene regulation is able to realize the dynamic regulation of gene expression with potential applications in bacterial physiology studies and metabolic engineering.",

A biocatalysis process for monacolin J conversion to simvastatin has been developed. However, direct bioproduction of monacolin J has not yet been achieved. Here, we identified a lovastatin hydrolase from Penicillium chrysogenum, which displays a 232-fold higher catalytic efficiency for the in vitro hydrolysis of lovastatin compared to a previously patented hydrolase, but no activity for simvastatin. Furthermore, we showed that an industrial A. terreus strain heterologously expressing this lovastatin hydrolase can produce monacolin J through single-step fermentation with high efficiency, approximately 95% of the biosynthesized lovastatin was hydrolyzed to monacolin J.

Here we improved titer and yield of fatty alcohols using an approach involving quantitative analysis of protein levels and metabolic flux, engineering enzyme level and localization, pull-push-block engineering of carbon flux, and cofactor balancing. We compared four heterologous FARs, finding highest activity and endoplasmic reticulum localization from a Mus musculus FAR. After screening an additional twenty-one single-gene edits, we identified increasing FAR expression; deleting competing reactions encoded by DGA1, HFD1, and ADH6; overexpressing a mutant acetyl-CoA carboxylase; limiting NADPH and carbon usage by the glutamate dehydrogenase encoded by GDH1; and overexpressing the Δ9-desaturase encoded by OLE1 as successful strategies to improve titer. Our final strain produced 1.2 g/L fatty alcohols in shake flasks, and 6.0 g/L in fed-batch fermentation, corresponding to ~ 20% of the maximum theoretical yield from glucose, the highest titers and yields reported to date in S. cerevisiae.

Previously, a succinate-production strain was obtained through the deletion of succinate dehydrogenase subunit encoding gene Ylsdh5. However, the accumulation of by-product acetate limited further improvement of succinate production. Meanwhile, additional pH adjustment procedure increased the downstream cost in industrial application. In this study, we identified for the first time that acetic acid overflow is caused by CoA-transfer reaction from acetyl-CoA to succinate in mitochondria rather than pyruvate decarboxylation reaction in SDH negative Y. lipolytica. The deletion of CoA-transferase gene Ylach eliminated acetic acid formation and improved succinic acid production and the cell growth. We then analyzed the effect of overexpressing the key enzymes of oxidative TCA, reductive carboxylation and glyoxylate bypass on succinic acid yield and by-products formation. The best strain with phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (ScPCK) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and endogenous succinyl-CoA synthase beta subunit (YlSCS2) overexpression improved succinic acid titer by 4.3-fold.

To facilitate the discovery of novel targets to enhance the pathway flux, we incorporated the computational tool YEASTRACT for predicting novel transcriptional repressors and OptForce strain-design for identifying non-intuitive pathway interventions. The multilevel approach consisted of (i) relieving the pathway from strong transcriptional repression, (ii) removing competing pathways to ensure high carbon capture, and (iii) rewiring precursor pathways to increase the carbon funneling to the desired target. The combination of these interventions led to the establishment of a S. cerevisiae strain with shikimic acid (SA) titer reaching as high as 2.5 g L−1, 7-fold higher than the base strain. Further expansion of the platform led to the titer of 2.7 g L−1 of muconic acid (MA) and its intermediate protocatechuic acid (PCA) together. Both the SA and MA production platforms demonstrated increases in titer and yield nearly 300% from the previously reported, highest-producing S. cerevisiae strains. Further examination elucidated the diverged impacts of disrupting the oxidative branch (ZWF1) of the pentose phosphate pathway on the titers of desired products belonging to different portions of the pathway. The investigation of other non-intuitive interventions like the deletion of the Pho13 enzyme also revealed the important role of the transaldolase in determining the fate of the carbon flux in the pathways of study. This integrative approach identified novel determinants at both transcriptional and metabolic levels that constrain the flux entering the aromatic amino acid pathway. In the future, this platform can be readily used for engineering the downstream modules toward the production of important plant-sourced aromatic secondary metabolites.",

We first constructed variants to explore the effect of codon optimization, copy number, and translation initiation rates on isopropanol production. The best strain (PA06) produced isopropanol at titers of 17.5 g/L, with a yield of 0.62 (mol/mol), and maximum productivity of 0.40 g/L/h. We next integrated the isopropanol synthetic pathway into the genome and then used the CRISPR EnAbled Trackable genome Engineering (CREATE) strategy to generate an additional 640 individual RBS library variants for further evaluation. After testing each of these variants, we constructed a combinatorial library containing 256 total variants from four different RBS levels for each gene. The best producing variant, PA14, produced isopropanol at titers of 7.1 g/L at 24 h, with a yield of 0.75 (mol/mol), and maximum productivity of 0.62 g/L/h (which was 0.22 g/L/h above the parent strain PA07).

In this study, we focus on the powerhouse of the CHO cell, the mitochondrion. Utilizing a high-resolution next generation sequencing approach we sequenced the Chinese hamster mitochondrial genome for the first time and surveyed the mutational landscape of CHO cell mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Depths of coverage ranging from ~3,319X to 8,056X enabled accurate identification of low frequency mutations (>1%), revealing that mtDNA heteroplasmy is widespread in CHO cells. A total of 197 variants at 130 individual nucleotide positions were identified across a panel of 22 cell lines with 81% of variants occurring at an allele frequency of between 1% and 99%. 89% of the heteroplasmic mutations identified were cell line specific with the majority of shared heteroplasmic SNPs and INDELs detected in clones from 2 cell line development projects originating from the same host cell line. The frequency of common predicted loss of function mutations varied significantly amongst the clones indicating that heteroplasmic mtDNA variation could lead to a continuous range of phenotypes and play a role in cell to cell, production run to production run and indeed clone to clone variation in CHO cell metabolism.

In this study, we developed a synthetic biology approach to promote the efficient biosynthesis of 2′-FL and 3-FL in engineered Escherichia coli. To boost the production of 2′-FL and 3-FL, multiple modular optimization strategies were applied in a plug-and-play manner. First, comparisons of various exogenous α1,2-fucosyltransferase and α1,3-fucosyltransferase candidates, as well as a series of E. coli host strains, demonstrated that futC and futA from Helicobacter pylori using BL21(DE3) as the host strain yielded the highest titers of 2′-FL and 3-FL. Subsequently, both the availability of the lactose acceptor substrate and the intracellular pool of the GDP-L-fucose donor substrate were optimized by inactivating competitive (or repressive) pathways and strengthening acceptor (or donor) availability to achieve overproduction. Moreover, the intracellular redox regeneration pathways were engineered to further enhance the production of 2′-FL and 3-FL. Finally, various culture conditions were optimized to achieve the best performance of 2′-FL and 3-FL biosynthesizing strains.

Here we use a metabolic engineering approach to manipulate the stoichiometry of fatty acid unsaturation, a regulator of cell membrane fluidity, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Unexpectedly, reduced lipid unsaturation triggered cell-cell adhesion (flocculation), a phenomenon characteristic of industrial yeast but uncommon in laboratory strains. We find that ER lipid saturation sensors induce expression of FLO1 – encoding a cell wall polysaccharide binding protein – independently of its canonical regulator. In wild-type cells, Flo1p-dependent flocculation occurs under oxygen-limited growth, which reduces unsaturated lipid synthesis and thus serves as the environmental trigger for flocculation. Transcriptional analysis shows that FLO1 is one of the most highly induced genes in response to changes in lipid unsaturation, and that the set of membrane fluidity-sensitive genes is globally activated as part of the cell's long-term response to hypoxia during fermentation. Our results show how the lipid homeostasis machinery of budding yeast is adapted to carry out a broad response to an environmental stimulus important in biotechnology.",

In our study, by manipulation of the key enzymes geraniol synthase (GES) and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (Erg20), geraniol (a valuable acyclic monoterpene alcohol) overproduction was achieved in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with truncated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme reductase (tHMGR) and isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI1) overexpressed. The expressions of all above engineered genes were under the control of Gal promoter for alleviating product toxicity. Geraniol production varied from trace amount to 43.19 mg/L (CrGES, GES from Catharanthus roseus) by screening of nine GESs from diverse species. Further through protein structure analysis and site-directed mutation in CrGES, it was firstly demonstrated that among the high-conserved amino acid residues located in active pocket, Y436 and D501 with strong affinity to diphosphate function group, were critical for the dephosphorylation (the core step for geraniol formation). Moreover, the truncation position of the transit peptide from the N-terminus of CrGES was found to influence protein expression and activity significantly, obtaining a titer of 191.61 mg/L geraniol in strain with CrGES truncated at S43 (t3CrGES). Furthermore, directed by surface electrostatics distribution of t3CrGES and Erg20WW (Erg20F96W-N127W), co-expression of the reverse fusion of Erg20ww/t3CrGES and another copy of Erg20WW promoted the geraniol titer to 523.96 mg/L at shakes flask level, due to enhancing GPP accessibility led by protein interaction of t3CrGES-Erg20WW and the free Erg20WW. Eventually, a highest reported titer of 1.68 g/L geraniol in eukaryote cells was achieved in 2.0 L fed-batch fermentation under carbon restriction strategy.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa are pathogens that contain an NO-generating nitrite (NO2−) reductase (NirS), and NO has been shown to influence their virulence. Interestingly, P. aeruginosa also contain NO dioxygenase (Fhp) and nitrate (NO3−) reductases, which together with NirS provide the potential for NO to be metabolically cycled (NO→NO3−→NO2−→NO). Deeper understanding of NO metabolism in P. aeruginosa will increase knowledge of its pathogenesis, and computational models have proven to be useful tools for the quantitative dissection of NO biochemical networks. Here we developed such a model for P. aeruginosa and confirmed its predictive accuracy with measurements of NO, O2, NO2−, and NO3− in mutant cultures devoid of Fhp or NorCB (NO reductase) activity. Using the model, we assessed whether NO was metabolically cycled in aerobic P. aeruginosa cultures. Calculated fluxes indicated a bottleneck at NO3−, which was relieved upon O2 depletion. As cell growth depleted dissolved O2 levels, NO3− was converted to NO2− at near-stoichiometric levels, whereas NO2− consumption did not coincide with NO or NO3− accumulation. Assimilatory NO2− reductase (NirBD) or NorCB activity could have prevented NO cycling, and experiments with ΔnirB, ΔnirS, and ΔnorC showed that NorCB was responsible for loss of flux from the cycle. Collectively, this work provides a computational tool to analyze NO metabolism in P. aeruginosa, and establishes that P. aeruginosa use NorCB to prevent metabolic cycling of NO.",

Previous studies have made many exciting achievements on functionally characterizing four core enzymes of this r-BOX cycle. However, the information about bottleneck nodes in this cycle is elusive. Here, a quantitative assessment of the inherent limitations of this cycle was conducted to capitalize on its potential. The selection of the core β-oxidation reversal enzymes in conjunction with acetyl-CoA synthetase endowed the ability to synthesize about 1 g/L MCFAs. Furthermore, a gene dosage experiment was developed to identify two rate-limiting enzymes (acetyl-CoA synthetase and thiolase). The de novo pathway was then separated into two modules at thiolase and MCFA production titer increased to 2.8 g/L after evaluating different construct environments. Additionally, the metabolism of host organism was reprogrammed to the desired biochemical product by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference system, resulted in a final MCFA production of 3.8 g/L.

Biological production of isopentenol via the mevalonate pathway has been optimized extensively in Escherichia coli, yielding 70% of its theoretical maximum. However, high ATP requirements and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) toxicity pose immediate challenges for engineering bacterial strains to overproduce commodities utilizing IPP as an intermediate. To overcome these limitations, we developed an “IPP-bypass” isopentenol pathway using the promiscuous activity of a mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (PMD) and demonstrated improved performance under aeration-limited conditions. However, relatively low activity of PMD toward the non-native substrate (mevalonate monophosphate, MVAP) was shown to limit flux through this new pathway. By inhibiting all IPP production from the endogenous non-mevalonate pathway, we developed a high-throughput screening platform that correlated promiscuous PMD activity toward MVAP with cellular growth. Successful identification of mutants that altered PMD activity demonstrated the sensitivity and specificity of the screening platform. Strains with evolved PMD mutants and the novel IPP-bypass pathway increased titers up to 2.4-fold. Further enzymatic characterization of the evolved PMD variants suggested that higher isopentenol titers could be achieved either by altering residues directly interacting with substrate and cofactor or by altering residues on nearby α-helices. These altered residues could facilitate the production of isopentenol by tuning either kcat or Ki of PMD for the non-native substrate. The synergistic modification made on PMD for the IPP-bypass mevalonate pathway is expected to significantly facilitate the industrial scale production of isopentenol.",

This strategy couples growth with production as 1-butanol pathway offers the only available terminal electron acceptors required for growth in anaerobic conditions. With further inclusion of other well-established metabolic engineering principles, a titer of 15 g/L has been obtained. In achieving this titer, many currently existing strategies have been exhausted, and 1-butanol toxicity level has been surpassed. Therefore, continued engineering of the host strain for increased production requires implementation of alternative strategies that seek to identify non-obvious targets for improvement. In this study, a metabolomics-driven approach was used to reveal a CoA imbalance resulting from a pta deletion that caused undesirable accumulation of pyruvate, butanoate, and other CoA-derived compounds. Using metabolomics, the reduction of butanoyl-CoA to butanal catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase AdhE2 was determined as a rate-limiting step. Fine-tuning of this activity and subsequent release of free CoA restored the CoA balance that resulted in a titer of 18.3 g/L upon improvement of total free CoA levels using cysteine supplementation. By enhancing AdhE2 activity, carbon flux was directed towards 1-butanol production and undesirable accumulation of pyruvate and butanoate was diminished.

     "abstract": "The product formation yield (product formed per unit substrate consumed) is often the most important performance indicator in metabolic engineering. Until now, the actual yield cannot be predicted, but it can be bounded by its maximum theoretical value. The maximum theoretical yield is calculated by considering the stoichiometry of the pathways and cofactor regeneration involved. Here we found that in many cases, dynamic stability becomes an issue when excessive pathway flux is drawn to a product. This constraint reduces the yield and renders the maximal theoretical yield too loose to be predictive. We propose a more realistic quantity, defined as the kinetically accessible yield (KAY) to predict the maximum accessible yield for a given flux alteration. KAY is either determined by the point of instability, beyond which steady states become unstable and disappear, or a local maximum before becoming unstable. Thus, KAY is the maximum flux that can be redirected for a given metabolic engineering strategy without losing stability. Strictly speaking, calculation of KAY requires complete kinetic information. With limited or no kinetic information, an Ensemble Modeling strategy can be used to determine a range of likely values for KAY, including an average prediction. We first apply the KAY concept with a toy model to demonstrate the principle of kinetic limitations on yield. We then used a full-scale E. coli model (193 reactions, 153 metabolites) and this approach was successful in E. coli for predicting production of isobutanol: the calculated KAY values are consistent with experimental data for three genotypes previously published.",

     "abstract": "Microbial conversion of methane to high-value bio-based fuels, chemicals, and materials offers a path to mitigate GHG emissions and valorize this abundant-yet -underutilized carbon source. In addition to fermentation optimization strategies, rational methanotrophic bacterial strain engineering offers a means to reach industrially relevant titers, carbon yields, and productivities of target products. The phosphoketolase pathway functions in heterofermentative bacteria where carbon flux through two sugar catabolic pathways to mixed acids (lactic acid and acetic acid) increases cellular ATP production. Importantly, this pathway also serves as an alternative route to produce acetyl-CoA that bypasses the CO2 lost through pyruvate decarboxylation in the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. Thus, the phosphoketolase pathway can be leveraged for carbon efficient biocatalysis to acetyl-CoA-derived intermediates and products. Here, we show that the industrially promising methane biocatalyst, Methylomicrobium buryatense, encodes two phosphoketolase isoforms that are expressed in methanol- and methane-grown cells. Overexpression of the PktB isoform led to a 2-fold increase in intracellular acetyl-CoA concentration, and a 2.6-fold yield enhancement from methane to microbial biomass and lipids compared to wild-type, increasing the potential for methanotroph lipid-based fuel production. Off-gas analysis and metabolite profiling indicated that global metabolic rearrangements, including significant increases in post-translational protein acetylation and gene expression of the tetrahydromethanopterin-linked pathway, along with decreases in several excreted products, coincided with the superior biomass and lipid yield observed in the engineered strain. Further, these data suggest that phosphoketolase may play a key regulatory role in methanotrophic bacterial metabolism. Given that acetyl-CoA is a key intermediate in several biosynthetic pathways, phosphoketolase overexpression offers a viable strategy to enhance the economics of an array of biological methane conversion processes.",

Technologies of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering of microorganisms can be deployed for the expression of new biochemical pathways for MEG-synthesis from gases, provided that such promising alternative routes are first identified.

These analyses helped identify not only better candidate pathways, but also superior chassis organisms that can be used for metabolic engineering of the candidate pathways. The pathway generation, pruning, and detailed analysis procedures described in this study can also be used to develop biochemical pathways for other commodity chemicals from gaseous substrates.",

     "abstract": "Clostridium thermocellum rapidly deconstructs cellulose and ferments resulting hydrolysis products into ethanol and other products, and is thus a promising platform organism for the development of cellulosic biofuel production via consolidated bioprocessing. While recent metabolic engineering strategies have targeted eliminating canonical fermentation products (acetate, lactate, formate, and H2), C. thermocellum also secretes amino acids, which has limited ethanol yields in engineered strains to approximately 70% of the theoretical maximum. To investigate approaches to decrease amino acid secretion, we attempted to reduce ammonium assimilation by deleting the Type I glutamine synthetase (glnA) in an essentially wild type strain of C. thermocellum. Deletion of glnA reduced levels of secreted valine and total amino acids by 53% and 44% respectively, and increased ethanol yields by 53%. RNA-seq analysis revealed that genes encoding the RNF-complex were more highly expressed in ΔglnA and may have a role in improving NADH-availability for ethanol production. While a significant up-regulation of genes involved in nitrogen assimilation and urea uptake suggested that deletion of glnA induces a nitrogen starvation response, metabolomic analysis showed an increase in intracellular glutamine levels indicative of nitrogen-rich conditions. We propose that deletion of glnA causes deregulation of nitrogen metabolism, leading to overexpression of nitrogen metabolism genes and, in turn, elevated glutamine levels. Here we demonstrate that perturbation of nitrogen assimilation is a promising strategy to redirect flux from the production of nitrogenous compounds toward biofuels in C. thermocellum.",

     "abstract": "Acetogens are attractive organisms for the production of chemicals and fuels from inexpensive and non-food feedstocks such as syngas (CO, CO2 and H2). Expanding their product spectrum beyond native compounds is dictated by energetics, particularly ATP availability. Acetogens have evolved sophisticated strategies to conserve energy from reduction potential differences between major redox couples, however, this coupling is sensitive to small changes in thermodynamic equilibria. To accelerate the development of strains for energy-intensive products from gases, we used a genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) to explore alternative ATP-generating pathways in the gas-fermenting acetogen Clostridium autoethanogenum. Shadow price analysis revealed a preference of C. autoethanogenum for nine amino acids. This prediction was experimentally confirmed under heterotrophic conditions. Subsequent in silico simulations identified arginine (ARG) as a key enhancer for growth. Predictions were experimentally validated, and faster growth was measured in media containing ARG (tD~4 h) compared to growth on yeast extract (tD~9 h). The growth-boosting effect of ARG was confirmed during autotrophic growth. Metabolic modelling and experiments showed that acetate production is nearly abolished and fast growth is realised by a three-fold increase in ATP production through the arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway. The involvement of the ADI pathway was confirmed by metabolomics and RNA-sequencing which revealed a ~500-fold up-regulation of the ADI pathway with an unexpected down-regulation of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. The data presented here offer a potential route for supplying cells with ATP, while demonstrating the usefulness of metabolic modelling for the discovery of native pathways for stimulating growth or enhancing energy availability.",

Here we present a novel regulatory target, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), in boosting microalgal lipid accumulation. G6PD, involved in the formation of NADPH demanded in fatty acid biosynthesis as reducing power, was characterized in oleaginous microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum. In G6PD overexpressing microalgae, transcript abundance of G6PD increased by 4.4-fold, and G6PD enzyme activity increased by more than 3.1-fold with enhanced NADPH production. Consequently, the lipid content increased by 2.7-fold and reached up to 55.7% of dry weight, while cell growth was not apparently affected. The fatty acid composition exhibited significant changes, including a remarkable increase in monounsaturated fatty acids C16:1 and C18:1 concomitant with a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids C20:5 and C22:6. G6PD was localized to the chloroplast and its overexpression stimulated an increase in the number and size of oil bodies. Proteomic and metabolomic analyzes revealed that G6PD play a key role in regulating pentose phosphate pathway and subsequently upregulating NADPH consuming pathways such as fatty acid synthesis, thus eventually leading to lipid accumulation. Our findings show the critical role of G6PD in microalgal lipid accumulation by enhancing NADPH supply and demonstrate that G6PD is a promising target for metabolic engineering.",

The five enzymes (including one for cofactor recycling) were first investigated individually to define optimal reaction conditions for the cascade reaction. Then, the kinetic parameters were determined under these conditions and the inhibitory effects of substrate, intermediates, and product were evaluated. As cofactor supply is critical for the cascade reaction, various set-ups were tested: increasing concentrations of the recycling enzyme, different initial NAD+ concentrations, as well as the use of a bubble reactor for faster oxygen diffusion.

While the RNA-guided nuclease Cas9 has been repurposed as a programmable transcription regulator, its application has typically been limited to binary on/off regulation and thus misses informative and potentially optimal intermediate levels of gene expression. In this work, we establish a rapid method for fine-tuned, graded expression of pathway enzymes via dCas9 regulation by varying sgRNA target location as the dominant parameter. Next, we utilize this technique to produce graded gene expression and Systematically Test Enzyme Perturbation Sensitivities (STEPS) to identify rate limiting steps in metabolic pathways. Specifically, we utilize this approach in an iterative fashion for the glycerol biosynthesis pathway and ultimately achieve a 5.7-fold increase in titer. We then demonstrate the portability of this approach by applying it to the pentose phosphate pathway in two distinct strain backgrounds. In doing so, we identify and alleviate pathway bottlenecks resulting in a 7.8-fold increase in 3-dehydroshikimate titer and the identification of 3 unique targets for xylose catabolism. This technique easily scales with DNA synthesis, a rapidly decreasing cost, and thus we envision that this technique can be used to complement genome-scale metabolic models by experimentally mapping the flux sensitivity of the entire genome to desired phenotypes.",

Here, we present a new concept for boosting the carbohydrate content of plants, by channeling photosynthetically fixed carbon into a newly engineered glucose polymer pool. We transiently expressed the starch/glycogen synthases from either Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Cyanidioschyzon merolae, together with the starch branching enzyme from C. merolae, in the cytosol of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. This effectively built a UDP-glucose-dependent glycogen biosynthesis pathway. Glycogen synthesis was observed with Transmission Electron Microscopy, and the polymer structure was further analyzed. Within three days of enzyme expression, glycogen content of the leaf was 5–10 times higher than the starch levels of the control. Further, the leaves produced less starch and sucrose, which are normally the carbohydrate end-products of photosynthesis. We conclude that after enzyme expression, the newly fixed carbohydrates were routed into the new glycogen sink and trapped. Our approach allows carbohydrates to be efficiently stored in a new subcellular compartment, thus increasing the value of vegetative crop tissues for biofuel production or animal feed. The method also opens new potential for increasing the sink strength of heterotrophic tissues.",

To mimic the natural metabolon architecture, we present a novel artificial metabolon that was created by targeting multi-enzyme cascade reactions onto inclusion body (IB) in Escherichia coli. The utility of this system was examined by co-localizing four heterologous enzymes of the 1-butanol pathway onto an IB that was formed in E. coli through overexpression of the cellulose binding domain (CBD) of Cellulomonas fimi exoglucanase. To target the 1-butanol pathway enzymes to the CBD IB, we utilized a peptide-peptide interaction between leucine zipper (LZ) peptides. We genetically fused the LZ peptide to the N-termini of four heterologous genes involved in the synthetic 1-butanol pathway, whereas an antiparallel LZ peptide was fused to the CBD gene. The in vivo activity of the CBD IB-based metabolon was examined through the determination of 1-butanol synthesis using E. coli transformed with two plasmids containing the LZ-fused CBD and LZ-fused 1-butanol pathway genes, respectively. In vivo synthesis of 1-butanol using the engineered E. coli yielded 1.98 g/L of 1-butanol from glucose, representing a 1.5-fold increase over that obtained from E. coli expressing the LZ-fused 1-butanol pathway genes alone. In an attempt to examine the in vitro 1-butanol productivity, we reconstituted CBD IB-based metabolon using CBD IB and individual enzymes of 1-butanol pathway. The 1-butanol productivity of in vitro reconstituted CBD IB-based metabolon using acetoacetyl-CoA as the starting material was 2.29 mg/L/h, 7.9-fold higher than that obtained from metabolon-free enzymes of 1-butanol pathway.

However, its ability to utilize xylose, the second most abundant sugar found in lignocellulosic biomass, is severely impaired by glucose-mediated carbon catabolite repression (CCR). In this study, CCR in C. tyrobutyricum was eliminated by overexpressing three heterologous xylose catabolism genes (xylT, xylA and xlyB) cloned from C. acetobutylicum. Compared to the parental strain, the engineered strain Ct-pTBA produced more butyric acid (37.8 g/L vs. 19.4 g/L) from glucose and xylose simultaneously, at a higher xylose utilization rate (1.28 g/L·h vs. 0.16 g/L·h) and efficiency (94.3% vs. 13.8%), resulting in a higher butyrate productivity (0.53 g/L·h vs. 0.26 g/L·h) and yield (0.32 g/g vs. 0.28 g/g). When the initial total sugar concentration was ~120 g/L, both glucose and xylose utilization rates increased with increasing their respective concentration or ratio in the co-substrates but the total sugar utilization rate remained almost unchanged in the fermentation at pH 6.0. Decreasing the pH to 5.0 significantly decreased sugar utilization rates and butyrate productivity, but the effect was more pronounced for xylose than glucose. The addition of benzyl viologen (BV) as an artificial electron carrier facilitated the re-assimilation of acetate and increased butyrate production to a final titer of 46.4 g/L, yield of 0.43 g/g sugar consumed, productivity of 0.87 g/L·h, and acid purity of 98.3% in free-cell batch fermentation, which were the highest ever reported for butyric acid fermentation.

However, with the exception of the symbiotic rhizobia-legumes system, progress towards a more extensive realization of this goal has been slow. In this study we manipulated the endogenous regulation of both nitrogen fixation and assimilation in the aerobic bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii. Substituting an exogenously inducible promoter for the native promoter of glutamine synthetase produced conditional lethal mutant strains unable to grow diazotrophically in the absence of the inducer. This mutant phenotype could be reverted in a double mutant strain bearing a deletion in the nifL gene that resulted in constitutive expression of nif genes and increased production of ammonium. Under GS non-inducing conditions both the single and the double mutant strains consistently released very high levels of ammonium (>20 mM) into the growth medium. The double mutant strain grew and excreted high levels of ammonium under a wider range of concentrations of the inducer than the single mutant strain. Induced mutant cells could be loaded with glutamine synthetase at different levels, which resulted in different patterns of extracellular ammonium accumulation afterwards. Inoculation of the engineered bacteria into a microalgal culture in the absence of sources of C and N other than N2 and CO2 from the air, resulted in a strong proliferation of microalgae that was suppressed upon addition of the inducer. Both single and double mutant strains also promoted growth of cucumber plants in the absence of added N-fertilizer, while this property was only marginal in the parental strain.

     "abstract": "Declining fossil fuel reserves, coupled with environmental concerns over their continued extraction and exploitation have led to strenuous efforts to identify renewable routes to energy and fuels. One attractive option is to convert glycerol, a by-product of the biodiesel industry, into n-butanol, an industrially important chemical and potential liquid transportation fuel, using Clostridium pasteurianum. Under certain growth conditions this Clostridium species has been shown to predominantly produce n-butanol, together with ethanol and 1,3-propanediol, when grown on glycerol. Further increases in the yields of n-butanol produced by C. pasteurianum could be accomplished through rational metabolic engineering of the strain. Accordingly, in the current report we have developed and exemplified a robust tool kit for the metabolic engineering of C. pasteurianum and used the system to make the first reported in-frame deletion mutants of pivotal genes involved in solvent production, namely hydA (hydrogenase), rex (Redox response regulator) and dhaBCE (glycerol dehydratase). We were, for the first time in C. pasteurianum, able to eliminate 1,3-propanediol synthesis and demonstrate its production was essential for growth on glycerol as a carbon source. Inactivation of both rex and hydA resulted in increased n-butanol titres, representing the first steps towards improving the utilisation of C. pasteurianum as a chassis for the industrial production of this important chemical.",

     "abstract": "Clostridium acetobutylicum possesses two homologous buk genes, buk (or buk1) and buk2, which encode butyrate kinases involved in the last step of butyrate formation. To investigate the contribution of buk in detail, an in-frame deletion mutant was constructed. However, in all the Δbuk mutants obtained, partial deletions of the upstream ptb gene were observed, and low phosphotransbutyrylase and butyrate kinase activities were measured. This demonstrates that i) buk (CA_C3075) is the key butyrate kinase-encoding gene and that buk2 (CA_C1660) that is poorly transcribed only plays a minor role; and ii) strongly suggests that a Δbuk mutant is not viable if the ptb gene is not also inactivated, probably due to the accumulation of butyryl-phosphate, which might be toxic for the cell.One of the ΔbukΔptb mutants was subjected to quantitative transcriptomic (mRNA molecules/cell) and fluxomic analyses in acidogenic, solventogenic and alcohologenic chemostat cultures. In addition to the low butyrate production, drastic changes in metabolic fluxes were also observed for the mutant: i) under acidogenic conditions, the primary metabolite was butanol and a new metabolite, 2-hydroxy-valerate, was produced ii) under solventogenesis, 58% increased butanol production was obtained compared to the control strain under the same conditions, and a very high yield of butanol formation (0.3 g g−1) was reached; and iii) under alcohologenesis, the major product was lactate. Furthermore, at the transcriptional level, adhE2, which encodes an aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase and is known to be a gene specifically expressed in alcohologenesis, was surprisingly highly expressed in all metabolic states in the mutant.The results presented here not only support the key roles of buk and ptb in butyrate formation but also highlight the metabolic flexibility of C. acetobutylicum in response to genetic alteration of its primary metabolism.",

     "abstract": "Establishing novel synthetic routes for microbial production of chemicals often requires overcoming pathway bottlenecks by tailoring enzymes to enhance bio-catalysis or even achieve non-native catalysis. Diol dehydratases have been extensively studied for their interactions with C2 and C3 diols. However, attempts on utilizing these insights to enable catalysis on non-native substrates with more than two hydroxyl groups have been plagued with low efficiencies. Here, we rationally engineered the Klebsiella oxytoca diol dehydratase to enable and enhance catalytic activity toward a non-native C4 triol, 1,2,4-butanetriol. We analyzed dehydratase's interaction with 1,2-propanediol and glycerol, which led us to develop rationally conceived hypotheses. An in silico approach was then developed to identify and screen candidate mutants with desired activity. This led to an engineered diol dehydratase with nearly 5 fold higher catalytic activity toward 1,2,4-butanetriol than the wild type as determined by in vitro assays. Based on this result, we then expanded the 1,2,4-butanetriol pathway to establish a novel 1,4-butanediol production platform. We engineered Escherichia coli's xylose catabolism to enhance the biosynthesis of 1,2,4-butanetriol from 224 mg/L to 1506 mg/L. By introducing the complete pathway in the engineered strain we achieve de novo biosynthesis of 1,4-butanediol at 209 mg/L from xylose. This work expands the repertoire of substrates catalyzed by diol dehydratases and serves as an elucidation to establish novel biosynthetic pathways involving dehydratase based biocatalysis.",

However, industrial fermentation of organic acids is often subject to end-product inhibition, which significantly retards cell growth and limits metabolic activities and final productivity. In this study, we report the development of metabolically engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum for high production of succinate by release of end-product inhibition coupled with an increase of key metabolic flux. It was found that the rates of glucose consumption and succinate production were significantly reduced by extracellular succinate in an engineered strain, S003. To understand the mechanism underlying the inhibition by succinate, comparative transcriptome analysis was performed. Among the downregulated genes, overexpression of the NCgl0275 gene was found to suppress the inhibition of glucose consumption and succinate production, resulting in a 37.7% increase in succinate production up to 55.4 g/L in fed-batch fermentation. Further improvement was achieved by increasing the metabolic flux from PEP to OAA. The final engineered strain was able to produce 152.2 g/L succinate, the highest production reported to date, with a yield of 1.1 g/g glucose under anaerobic condition. These results suggest that the release of end-product inhibition coupled with an increase in key metabolic flux is a promising strategy for enhancing production of succinate.",

The heterologous production of triterpene saponins in microbes remains challenging and only limited successful pathway engineering endeavors have been reported. To improve the production capacities of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae saponin production platform, we assessed the effects of several hitherto unexplored gene knockout targets on the heterologous production of triterpenoids. Here, we show that the disruption of the phosphatidic acid phosphatase-encoding PAH1 through CRISPR/Cas9 results in a dramatic expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which stimulated the production of recombinant triterpene biosynthesis enzymes and ultimately boosted triterpenoid and triterpene saponin accumulation. Compared to the wild-type starter strain, accumulation of the oleanane-type sapogenin β-amyrin, of its oxidized derivative medicagenic acid, and its glucosylated version medicagenic-28-O-glucoside was respectively increased by eight-, six- and 16-fold in the pah1 strain. A positive effect of pah1 could also be observed for the production of other terpenoids depending on ER-associated enzymes for their biosynthesis, such as the sesquiterpenoid artemisinic acid, which increased by twofold relative to the wild-type strain.

     "abstract": "Many desired phenotypes for producing cellulosic biofuels are often observed in industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. However, many industrial yeast strains are polyploid and have low spore viability, making it difficult to use these strains for metabolic engineering applications. We selected the polyploid industrial strain S. cerevisiae ATCC 4124 exhibiting rapid glucose fermentation capability, high ethanol productivity, strong heat and inhibitor tolerance in order to construct an optimal yeast strain for producing cellulosic ethanol. Here, we focused on developing a general approach and high-throughput screening method to isolate stable haploid segregants derived from a polyploid parent, such as triploid ATCC 4124 with a poor spore viability. Specifically, we deleted the HO genes, performed random sporulation, and screened the resulting segregants based on growth rate, mating type, and ploidy. Only one stable haploid derivative (4124-S60) was isolated, while 14 other segregants with a stable mating type were aneuploid. The 4124-S60 strain inherited only a subset of desirable traits present in the parent strain, same as other aneuploids, suggesting that glucose fermentation and specific ethanol productivity are likely to be genetically complex traits and/or they might depend on ploidy. Nonetheless, the 4124-60 strain did inherit the ability to tolerate fermentation inhibitors. When additional genetic perturbations known to improve xylose fermentation were introduced into the 4124-60 strain, the resulting engineered strain (IIK1) was able to ferment a Miscanthus hydrolysate better than a previously engineered laboratory strain (SR8), built by making the same genetic changes. However, the IIK1 strain showed higher glycerol and xylitol yields than the SR8 strain. In order to decrease glycerol and xylitol production, an NADH-dependent acetate reduction pathway was introduced into the IIK1 strain. By consuming 2.4 g/L of acetate, the resulting strain (IIK1A) exhibited a 14% higher ethanol yield and 46% lower byproduct yield than the IIK1 strain from anaerobic fermentation of the Miscanthus hydrolysate. Our results demonstrate that industrial yeast strains can be engineered via haploid isolation. The isolated haploid strain (4124-S60) can be used for metabolic engineering to produce fuels and chemicals.",

To address this dilemma, we design a synergetic carbon utilization mechanism (SynCar), in which glucose catabolism is inactivated and a second carbon source (e.g. glycerol) is employed to maintain cell growth and rationally strengthen PEP driving force for glucose uptake and non-catabolic utilization. Remarkably, a trehalose biosynthesis model developed for proof-of-concept indicates that SynCar leads to 131% and 200% improvement in trehalose titer and yield, respectively. The conversion rate of glucose to trehalose reaches 91% of the theoretical maximum.

In the absence of experimentally validated flux maps, constraint-based approaches such as MOMA and RELATCH cannot be used to guide new metabolic engineering designs. In this work, we have addressed this critical gap in current understanding by performing comprehensive characterizations of glucose and xylose metabolism under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, using recent state-of-the-art techniques in 13C metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA). Specifically, we quantified precise metabolic fluxes for each condition by performing parallel labeling experiments and analyzing the data through integrated 13C-MFA using the optimal tracers [1,2-13C]glucose, [1,6-13C]glucose, [1,2-13C]xylose and [5-13C]xylose. We also quantified changes in biomass composition and confirmed turnover of macromolecules by applying [U-13C]glucose and [U-13C]xylose tracers. We demonstrated that under anaerobic growth conditions there is significant turnover of lipids and that a significant portion of CO2 originates from biomass turnover. Using knockout strains, we also demonstrated that β-oxidation is critical for anaerobic growth on xylose. Quantitative analysis of co-factor balances (NADH/FADH2, NADPH, and ATP) for different growth conditions provided new insights regarding the interplay of energy and redox metabolism and the impact on E. coli cell physiology.",

     "abstract": "Tolerance of yeast to acid stress is important for many industrial processes including organic acid production. Therefore, elucidating the molecular basis of long term adaptation to acidic environments will be beneficial for engineering production strains to thrive under such harsh conditions. Previous studies using gene expression analysis have suggested that both organic and inorganic acids display similar responses during short term exposure to acidic conditions. However, biological mechanisms that will lead to long term adaptation of yeast to acidic conditions remains unknown and whether these mechanisms will be similar for tolerance to both organic and inorganic acids is yet to be explored. We therefore evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae to acquire tolerance to HCl (inorganic acid) and to 0.3 M L-lactic acid (organic acid) at pH 2.8 and then isolated several low pH tolerant strains. Whole genome sequencing and RNA-seq analysis of the evolved strains revealed different sets of genome alterations suggesting a divergence in adaptation to these two acids. An altered sterol composition and impaired iron uptake contributed to HCl tolerance whereas the formation of a multicellular morphology and rapid lactate degradation was crucial for tolerance to high concentrations of lactic acid. Our findings highlight the contribution of both the selection pressure and nature of the acid as a driver for directing the evolutionary path towards tolerance to low pH. The choice of carbon source was also an important factor in the evolutionary process since cells evolved on two different carbon sources (raffinose and glucose) generated a different set of mutations in response to the presence of lactic acid. Therefore, different strategies are required for a rational design of low pH tolerant strains depending on the acid of interest.",

SACE_Lrp directly controlled the expression of the divergently transcribed SACE_5387-5386 operon putatively encoding a BCAA ABC transporter by interacting with the intergenic region between SACE_Lrp and SACE_5387 (SACE_Lrp-5387-int), and indirectly controlled the expression of ilvE putatively encoding an aminotransferase catabolizing BCAAs. BCAA catabolism is one source of the precursors for erythromycin biosynthesis. Lysine and arginine promoted the dissociation of SACE_Lrp from SACE_Lrp -5387-int, whereas histidine increased their binding. Gene disruption of SACE_Lrp (ΔSACE_Lrp) in S. erythraea A226 resulted in a 25% increase in erythromycin production, while overexpression of SACE_5387-5386 in A226 enhanced erythromycin production by 36%.

Herein, a silent glycerol catabolism pathway encoded by glp system was activated in a Klebsiella pneumoniae mutant, of which the acetoin degradation pathway was blocked. Surprisingly, the activation produced significant effects on cellular metabolism and over 90% of the carbon flux was redirected to acetoin biosynthesis, which was formerly a minor product in this mutant. Transcription analyses suggest that the genes involved in acetoin, 1,3-propanediol and adenosyl-cobalamin biosynthesis were differentially regulated upon the glp system activation, demonstrating the cross-talk between silent and active pathways. Through pathway, cofactor and bioprocess engineering, high-level acetoin production from glycerol (32.2 g L−1, 90.8% of the theoretical value) was achieved. Our findings suggest that some silent genes represent unexplored switches of cellular metabolic status and activating them may be an easy strategy for reprogramming microorganisms into efficient cell factories.",

Here, we demonstrate a synthetic ATP- and CoA-free 12-enzyme pathway to implement the complete oxidation of glucose in vitro. This pathway is comprised of glucose phosphorylation via polyphosphate glucokinase, NADH generation catalyzed by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), electron transfer from NADH to the anode, and glucose 6-phosphate regeneration via the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and gluconeogenesis. The faraday efficiency from glucose to electrons via this pathway was as high as 98.8%, suggesting the generation of nearly 24 electrons per molecule of glucose. The generated current density was greatly increased from 2.8 to 6.9 mA cm−2 by replacing a low-activity G6PDH with a high-activity G6PDH and introducing a new enzyme, 6-phosphogluconolactonase, between G6PDH and 6PGDH.

Knowledge of the metabolic state of a cell and how it responds to various stimuli and extracellular conditions can offer significant insight in the regulatory functions and how to manipulate them. Constraint based methods, such as Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and Thermodynamics-based flux analysis (TFA), are commonly used to estimate the flow of metabolites through genome-wide metabolic networks, making it possible to identify the ranges of flux values that are consistent with the studied physiological and thermodynamic conditions. However, unless key intracellular fluxes and metabolite concentrations are known, constraint-based models lead to underdetermined problem formulations. This lack of information propagates as uncertainty in the estimation of fluxes and basic reaction properties such as the determination of reaction directionalities. Therefore, knowledge of which metabolites, if measured, would contribute the most to reducing this uncertainty can significantly improve our ability to define the internal state of the cell. In the present work we combine constraint based modeling, Design of Experiments (DoE) and Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) into the Thermodynamics-based Metabolite Sensitivity Analysis (TMSA) method. TMSA ranks metabolites comprising a metabolic network based on their ability to constrain the gamut of possible solutions to a limited, thermodynamically consistent set of internal states. TMSA is modular and can be applied to a single reaction, a metabolic pathway or an entire metabolic network. This is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to use metabolic modeling in order to provide a significance ranking of metabolites to guide experimental measurements.",

Novel T7-like RNA polymerase-promoter pairs were obtained by mining phage genomes, followed by in vivo characterization in non-model strains Halomonas spp TD01 and Pseudomonas entomophila.

The expression under the corresponding T7-like promoter libraries persisted with striking correlations (R2 >0.94) between Escherichia coli and Halomonas sp.

A functional 3-HP synthesis pathway was engineered through a combination of genes involved in glycerol synthesis (fusion of gpd and gpp from Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and 3-HP production (pduCDEGH from Klebsiella pneumoniae and aldehyde dehydrogenases from various resources). High 3-HP yield was achieved by screening of active aldehyde dehydrogenases and by minimizing byproduct synthesis (gapAA1GΔldhAΔpta-ackAΔpoxBΔglpK). Substitution of phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent glucose uptake system (PTS) by inositol permeases (iolT1) and glucokinase (glk) further increased 3-HP production to 38.6 g/L, with the yield of 0.48 g/g glucose. To broaden its substrate spectrum, the engineered strain was modified to incorporate the pentose transport gene araE and xylose catabolic gene xylAB, allowing for the simultaneous utilization of glucose and xylose.

Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, a model strain of methylotrophic cell factories using methanol as carbon source, is of interest because it produces abundant coenzyme A compounds capable of directing to synthesis of different useful compounds from methanol. However, acetyl-CoA is not always efficiently accumulated in M. extorquens AM1, as it is located in the center of three cyclic central metabolic pathways. Here we successfully demonstrated a strategy for sensor-assisted transcriptional regulator engineering (SATRE) to control metabolic flux re-distribution to increase acetyl-CoA flux from methanol for mevalonate production in M. extorquens AM1 with introduction of mevalonate synthesis pathway. A mevalonate biosensor was constructed and we succeeded in isolating a mutated strain (Q49) with a 60% increase in mevalonate concentration (an acetyl-CoA–derived product) following sensor-based high-throughput screening of a QscR transcriptional regulator library. The mutated QscR-49 regulator (Q8*,T61S,N72Y,E160V) lost an N-terminal α-helix and underwent a change in the secondary structure of the RD-I domain at the C terminus, two regions that are related to its interaction with DNA. 13C labeling analysis revealed that acetyl-CoA flux was improved by 7% and transcriptional analysis revealed that QscR had global effects and that two key points, NADPH generation and fumC overexpression, might contribute to the carbon flux re-distribution. A fed-batch fermentation in a 5-L bioreactor for QscR-49 mutant yielded a mevalonate concentration of 2.67 g/L, which was equivalent to an overall yield of 0.055 mol acetyl-CoA/mol methanol, the highest yield among engineered strains of M. extorquens AM1.

Yet another pathway, the malate shunt, uses the combined activities of PEPCK, malate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme. First we showed that there is no flux through the ODC pathway by enzyme assay. Flux through the remaining two pathways (PPDK and malate shunt) was determined by dynamic 13C labeling. In the wild-type strain, the malate shunt accounts for about 33±2% of the flux to pyruvate, with the remainder via the PPDK pathway.

     "abstract": "Fermentative redox balance has long been utilized as a metabolic evolution platform to improve efficiency of NADH-dependent pathways. However, such system relies on the complete recycling of NADH and may become limited when the target pathway results in excess NADH stoichiometrically. In this study, endogenous capability of Escherichia coli for 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD) synthesis was explored using the anaerobic selection platform based on redox balance. To address the issue of NADH excess associated with the 2,3-BD pathway, we devised a substrate-decoupled system where a pathway intermediate is externally supplied in addition to the carbon source to decouple NADH recycling ratio from the intrinsic pathway stoichiometry. In this case, feeding of the 2,3-BD precursor acetoin effectively restored anaerobic growth of the mixed-acid fermentation mutant that remained otherwise inhibited even in the presence of a functional 2,3-BD pathway. Using established 2,3-BD dehydrogenases as model enzyme, we verified that the redox-based selection system is responsive to NADPH-dependent reactions but with lower sensitivity. Based on this substrate-decoupled selection scheme, we successfully identified the glycerol/1,2-propanediol dehydrogenase (Ec-GldA) as the major enzyme responsible for the acetoin reducing activity (kcat/Km≈0.4 mM−1 s−1) observed in E. coli. Significant shift of 2,3-BD configuration upon withdrawal of the heterologous acetolactate decarboxylase revealed that the endogenous synthesis of acetoin occurs via diacetyl. Among the predicted diacetyl reductase in E. coli, Ec-UcpA displayed the most significant activity towards diacetyl reduction into acetoin (Vmax≈6 U/mg). The final strain demonstrated a meso-2,3-BD production titer of 3 g/L without introduction of foreign genes. The substrate-decoupled selection system allows redox balance regardless of the pathway stoichiometry thus enables segmented optimization of different reductive pathways through enzyme bioprospecting and metabolic evolution.",

We previously constructed a synthetic metabolic pathway composed of genes from Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This pathway enabled 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) production from cellular DHAP via glycerol in the cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. The production of 1,3-PDO (3.79 mM, 0.29 g/l) directly from carbon dioxide by engineered S. elongatus PCC 7942 was successfully accomplished. However, the constructed strain accumulated a remarkable amount of glycerol (12.6 mM, 1.16 g/l), an intermediate metabolite in 1,3-PDO production. Notably, enhancement of latter reactions of synthetic metabolic pathway for conversion of glycerol to 1,3-PDO increases 1,3-PDO production. In this study, we aimed to increase the observed 1,3-PDO production titer. First, the weaker S. elongatus PCC 7942 promoter, PLlacO1, was replaced with a stronger promoter (Ptrc) to regulate genes involved in the conversion of glycerol to 1,3-PDO. Second, the induction timing for gene expression and medium composition were optimized. Promoter replacement resulted in higher 1,3-PDO production than glycerol accumulation, and the amount of products (1,3-PDO and glycerol) generated via the synthetic metabolic pathway increased with optimization of medium composition. Accordingly, we achieved the highest titer of 1,3-PDO (16.1 mM, 1.22 g/l) and this was higher than glycerol accumulation (9.46 mM, 0.87 g/l).

     "abstract": "Sesquiterpenes are C15 isoprenoids with utility as fragrances, flavours, pharmaceuticals, and potential biofuels. Microbial fermentation is being examined as a competitive approach for bulk production of these compounds. Competition for carbon allocation between synthesis of endogenous sterols and production of the introduced sesquiterpene limits yields. Achieving balance between endogenous sterols and heterologous sesquiterpenes is therefore required to achieve economical yields. In the current study, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to produce the acyclic sesquiterpene alcohol, trans-nerolidol. Nerolidol production was first improved by enhancing the upstream mevalonate pathway for the synthesis of the precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). However, excess FPP was partially directed towards squalene by squalene synthase (Erg9p), resulting in squalene accumulation to 1% biomass; moreover, the specific growth rate declined. In order to re-direct carbon away from sterol production and towards the desired heterologous sesquiterpene, a novel protein destabilisation approach was developed for Erg9p. It was shown that Erg9p is located on endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets through a C-terminal ER-targeted transmembrane peptide. A PEST (rich in Pro, Glu/Asp, Ser, and Thr) sequence-dependent endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD)mechanism was established to decrease cellular levels of Erg9p without relying on inducers, repressors or specific repressing conditions. This improved nerolidol titre by 86% to ~100 mg L−1. In this strain, squalene levels were similar to the wild-type control strain, and downstream ergosterol levels were slightly decreased relative to the control, indicating redirection of carbon away from sterols and towards sesquiterpene production. There was no negative effect on cell growth under these conditions. Protein degradation is an efficient mechanism to control carbon allocation at flux-competing nodes in metabolic engineering applications. This study demonstrates that an engineered ERAD mechanism can be used to balance flux competition between the endogenous sterol pathway and an introduced bio-product pathways at the FPP node. The approach of protein degradation in general might be more widely applied to improve metabolic engineering outcomes.",

In this study, 13C-metabolic flux analysis was used to characterize two violacein-producing E. coli strains with vastly different productivities, and to profile their metabolic adjustments resulting from external perturbations during fermentation. The two strains were first grown at 37 °C in stage 1, and then the temperature was transitioned to 20 °C in stage 2 for the optimal expression of the violacein synthesis pathway. After induction, violacein production was minimal in stage 3, but accelerated in stage 4 (early production phase) and 5 (late production phase) in the high producing strain, reaching a final concentration of 1.5 mmol/L. On the contrary, ~0.02 mmol/L of violacein was obtained from the low producing strain. To have a snapshot of the temporal metabolic changes in each stage, we performed 13C-MFA via isotopomer analysis of fast-turnover free metabolites. The results indicate strikingly stable flux ratios in the central metabolism throughout the early growth stages. In the late stages, however, the high producer rewired its flux distribution significantly, which featured an upregulated pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle, reflux from acetate utilization, negligible anabolic fluxes, and elevated maintenance loss, to compensate for nutrient depletion and drainage of some building blocks due to violacein overproduction. The low producer with stronger promoters shifted its relative fluxes in stage 5 by enhancing the flux through the TCA cycle and acetate overflow, while exhibiting a reduced biomass growth and a minimal flux towards violacein synthesis. Interestingly, the addition of the violacein precursor (tryptophan) in the medium inhibited high producer but enhanced low producer's productivity, leading to hypotheses of unknown pathway regulations (such as metabolite channeling).",

     "abstract": "Current studies on microbial isoprene biosynthesis have mostly focused on regulation of the upstream mevalonic acid (MVA) or methyl-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. However, the downstream bottleneck restricting isoprene biosynthesis capacity caused by the weak expression and low activity of plant isoprene synthase (ISPS) under microbial fermentation conditions remains to be alleviated. Here, based on a previously constructed Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain with enhanced precursor supply, we strengthened the downstream pathway through increasing both the expression and activity of ISPS to further improve isoprene production. Firstly, a two-level expression enhancement system was developed for the PGAL1-controlled ISPS by overexpression of GAL 4. Meanwhile, the native GAL1/7/10 promoters were deleted to avoid competition for the transcriptional activator Gal4p, and GAL80 was disrupted to eliminate the dependency of gene expression on galactose induction. The IspS expression was obviously elevated upon enhanced Gal4p supply, and the isoprene production was improved from 6.0 mg/L to 23.6 mg/L in sealed-vial cultures with sucrose as carbon source. Subsequently, a novel high-throughput screening method was developed based on precursor toxicity and used for ISPS directed evolution towards enhanced catalytic activity. Combinatorial mutagenesis of the resulting ISPS mutants generated the best mutant ISPSM4, introduction of which into the GAL4-overexpressing strain YXM29 achieved 50.2 mg/L of isoprene in sealed vials, and the isoprene production reached 640 mg/L and 3.7 g/L in aerobic batch and fed-batch fermentations, respectively. These results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed combinatorial engineering strategy in isoprene biosynthesis, which might also be feasible and instructive for biotechnological production of other valuable chemicals.",

The assembly processes should be simple, scalable, versatile, and biologically benign to minimize loss of component parts. A “plug and play” methodology comprising a generic linking apparatus may enable rapid design and optimization. One application that desires these qualities is metabolon construction wherein multiple enzymes are organized in defined pathways to mediate biochemical flux. Here, we propose a modular design by incorporation of crosslinking-compliant amino acid tags comprised of lysine or glutamine residues at the N- or C-termini of the to-be-assembled proteins. These amino acid tags enable covalent crosslinking using microbial transglutaminase (mTG). Modularity is demonstrated where stoichiometries and relative positions of enzymes and other functional proteins are altered. Construction of multifunctional complexes is demonstrated by crosslinking domains of different function and origin. Namely, we built a two-subunit quorum sensing (QS) biosynthetic metabolon on solid supports and altered stoichiometries of the limiting constituents to increase the overall rate of reaction. To display functionality beyond biosynthesis, we constructed a molecular communication ‘device’ (antibody binding Protein G–QS complex) to target bacterial cells and demonstrated tailored QS responses among targeted bacteria. We propose that this approach, solid phase mTG-mediated linkage of biological components, can be used for assembly within many environments including microreactors or lab-on-a-chip systems. Because the methodology is general, we envision construction of multi-functional protein complexes in a ‘plug and play’ fashion for a variety of biosensing and synthetic biology applications.",

The precision of fluxes determined by 13C-MFA depends largely on the choice of isotopic tracers and the specific set of labeling measurements. A recent advance in the field is the use of parallel labeling experiments for improved flux precision and accuracy. However, as of today, no systemic methods exist for identifying optimal tracers for parallel labeling experiments. In this contribution, we have addressed this problem by introducing a new scoring system and evaluating thousands of different isotopic tracer schemes. Based on this extensive analysis we have identified optimal tracers for 13C-MFA. The best single tracers were doubly 13C-labeled glucose tracers, including [1,6-13C]glucose, [5,6-13C]glucose and [1,2-13C]glucose, which consistently produced the highest flux precision independent of the metabolic flux map (here, 100 random flux maps were evaluated). Moreover, we demonstrate that pure glucose tracers perform better overall than mixtures of glucose tracers. For parallel labeling experiments the optimal isotopic tracers were [1,6-13C]glucose and [1,2-13C]glucose. Combined analysis of [1,6-13C]glucose and [1,2-13C]glucose labeling data improved the flux precision score by nearly 20-fold compared to widely use tracer mixture 80% [1-13C]glucose +20% [U-13C]glucose.",

The dynamic equilibrium of fatty aldehydes, key intermediates, played a critical role in microbial alkanes production, due to the poor catalytic capability of aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO). In our study, exploration of competitive pathway together with multi-modular optimization was utilized to improve fatty aldehydes balance and consequently enhance alkanes formation in Escherichia coli. Endogenous fatty alcohol formation was supposed to be competitive with alkane production, since both of the two routes consumed the same intermediate—fatty aldehyde. Nevertheless, in our case, alkanes production in E. coli was enhanced from trace amount to 58.8 mg/L by the facilitation of moderate fatty alcohol biosynthesis, which was validated by deletion of endogenous aldehyde reductase (AHR), overexpression of fatty alcohol oxidase (FAO) and consequent transcriptional assay of aar, ado and adhP genes. Moreover, alkanes production was further improved to 81.8 mg/L, 86.6 mg/L or 101.7 mg/L by manipulation of fatty acid biosynthesis, lipids degradation or electron transfer system modules, which directly referenced to fatty aldehydes dynamic pools. A titer of 1.31 g/L alkanes was achieved in 2.5 L fed-batch fermentation, which was the highest reported titer in E. coli.

Heterologous production of itaconic acid with Escherichia coli could help to overcome limitations of A. terreus regarding slow growth and high sensitivity to oxygen supply. However, the performance achieved so far with E. coli strains is still low.We introduced a plasmid (pCadCS) carrying genes for itaconic acid production into E. coli and applied a model-based approach to construct a high yield production strain. Based on the concept of minimal cut sets, we identified intervention strategies that guarantee high itaconic acid yield while still allowing growth. One cut set was selected and the corresponding genes were iteratively knocked-out. As a conceptual novelty, we pursued an adaptive approach allowing changes in the model and initially calculated intervention strategy if a genetic modification induces changes in byproduct formation. Using this approach, we iteratively implemented five interventions leading to high yield itaconic acid production in minimal medium with glucose as substrate supplemented with small amounts of glutamic acid. The derived E. coli strain (ita23: MG1655 ∆aceA ∆sucCD ∆pykA ∆pykF ∆pta ∆Picd::cam_BBa_J23115 pCadCS) synthesized 2.27 g/l itaconic acid with an excellent yield of 0.77 mol/(mol glucose). In a fed-batch cultivation, this strain produced 32 g/l itaconic acid with an overall yield of 0.68 mol/(mol glucose) and a peak productivity of 0.45 g/l/h.

In order to contribute to overcoming these limitations we exploited the possibility of secreting lipids to the culture broth, uncoupling production and biomass formation and facilitating the extraction.

In the course of the construction of a suitable C. glutamicum platform strain for plant polyphenol production, four gene clusters comprising 21 genes involved in the catabolism of aromatic compounds were deleted. Expression of plant-derived and codon-optimized genes coding for a chalcone synthase (CHS) and a chalcone isomerase (CHI) in this strain background enabled formation of 35 mg/L naringenin and 37 mg/L eriodictyol from the supplemented phenylpropanoids p-coumaric acid and caffeic acid, respectively.

Stilbene concentrations of up to 158 mg/L could be achieved. Additional engineering of the amino acid metabolism for an optimal connection to the synthetic plant polyphenol pathways enabled resveratrol production directly from glucose.

Here, we demonstrate that isotopic labeling of glycogen and RNA, measured with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), provides valuable additional information for 13C-MFA. Specifically, we demonstrate that isotopic labeling of glucose moiety of glycogen and ribose moiety of RNA greatly enhances resolution of metabolic fluxes in the upper part of metabolism; importantly, these measurements allow precise quantification of net and exchange fluxes in the pentose phosphate pathway. To demonstrate the practical importance of these measurements for 13C-MFA, we have used Escherichia coli as a model microbial system and CHO cells as a model mammalian system. Additionally, we have applied this approach to determine metabolic fluxes of glucose and xylose co-utilization in the E. coli ΔptsG mutant. The convenience of measuring glycogen and RNA, which are stable and abundant in microbial and mammalian cells, offers the following key advantages: reduced sample size, no quenching required, no extractions required, and GC-MS can be used instead of more costly LC-MS/MS techniques.

Experiments in which glucose availability was changed over a short time scale were performed in a two-compartment bioreactor system. Quick metabolic responses were observed during the first 30 s of glucose shortage, and after 70 s, fundamental transcriptional programs were initiated. Since cells are fluctuating under simulated large-scale conditions, this scenario represents a continuous on/off switching of about 600 genes. Furthermore, the resulting ATP maintenance demands were increased by about 40–50%, allowing us to conclude that hyper-producing strains could become ATP-limited under large-scale production conditions. Based on the observed transcriptional patterns, we identified a number of candidate gene deletions that may reduce unwanted ATP losses. In summary, we present a theoretical framework that provides biological targets that could be used to engineer novel E. coli strains such that large-scale performance equals laboratory-scale expectations.",

To develop a better understanding, we used acetate as the sole carbon source to culture two strains, a control strain and a previously engineered strain for lipid overaccumulation. For both strains, metabolism during the growth phase and lipid production phase were investigated by metabolic flux analysis using two parallel sodium acetate tracers. The resolved flux distributions demonstrate that the glyoxylate shunt pathway is constantly active and the flux through gluconeogenesis varies depending on strain and phase. In particular, by regulating the activities of malate transport and pyruvate kinase, the cells divert only a portion of the glyoxylate shunt flux required to satisfy the needs for anaplerotic reactions and NADPH production through gluconeogenesis and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Excess flux flows back to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for energy production. As with the case of glucose as the substrate, the primary source for lipogenic NADPH is derived from the oxidative PPP.",

Previously, Escherichia coli strains engineered for BCFA production also co-produced a large percentage of SCFA, complicating efficient isolation of BCFA. Here, we identified a key bottleneck in BCFA production: incomplete lipoylation of 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases. We engineered two protein lipoylation pathways that not only restored 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase lipoylation, but also increased BCFA production dramatically. E. coli expressing an optimized lipoylation pathway produced 276 mg/L BCFA, comprising 85% of the total free fatty acids (FFAs). Furthermore, we fine-tuned BCFA branch positions, yielding strains specifically producing ante-iso or odd-chain iso BCFA as 77% of total FFA, separately. When coupled with an engineered branched-chain amino acid pathway to enrich the branched-chain α-ketoacid pool, BCFA can be produced from glucose at 181 mg/L and 72% of total FFA. While E. coli can metabolize BCFAs, we demonstrated that they are not incorporated into the cell membrane, allowing our system to produce a high percentage of BCFA without affecting membrane fluidity.

Analysis of apoplast and cell content and apoplast exclusion assays show that AaLTP3 and AaPDR2 prevent reflux of (DH)AA from the apoplast back into the cells and enhances overall flux through the pathway. Moreover, AaLTP3 is stabilized in the presence of AN-PW activity and co-expression of AN-PW+AaLTP3+AaPDR2 genes yielded AN and AB in necrotic N. benthamiana leaves at 13 days post-agroinfiltration. This newly discovered function of LTPs opens up new possibilities for the engineering of biosynthesis pathways of high value terpenes in heterologous expression systems.",

We have adapted the clustered regularly interspersed palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system from Streptococcus pyogenes to repress genes in trans in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 (hereafter PCC 7002). With this approach, termed CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), transcription of a specific target sequence is repressed by a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein recruited to the target DNA by base-pair interactions with a single guide RNA that is complementary to the target sequence. We adapted this system for PCC 7002 and achieved conditional and titratable repression of a heterologous reporter gene, yellow fluorescent protein. Next, we demonstrated the utility of finely tuning native gene expression by downregulating the abundance of phycobillisomes. In addition, we created a conditional auxotroph by repressing synthesis of the carboxysome, an essential component of the carbon concentrating mechanism cyanobacteria use to fix atmospheric CO2. Lastly, we demonstrated a novel strategy for increasing central carbon flux by conditionally downregulating a key node in nitrogen assimilation. The resulting cells produced 2-fold more lactate than a baseline engineered cell line, representing the highest photosynthetically generated productivity to date. This work is the first example of titratable repression in cyanobacteria using CRISPRi, enabling dynamic regulation of essential processes and manipulation of flux through central carbon metabolism. This tool facilitates the study of essential genes of unknown function and enables groundbreaking metabolic engineering capability, by providing a straightforward approach to redirect metabolism and carbon flux in the production of high-value chemicals.",

After introduction of the dynamically controlled TIGR-mediated MEV pathway into Escherichia coli, the content and concentration of zeaxanthin in shaker flask cultures were 2.0- and 2.1-fold higher, respectively, than those of the strain harboring the statically controlled non-TIGR-mediated MEV pathway.

Here, we engineered the eukaryotic microbial host Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the de novo biosynthesis of methylxanthines.

To achieve this, the shikimate kinase and other potential metabolic activities for the consumption of shikimate and its precursor dehydroshikimate were inactivated. Carbon flux toward shikimate synthesis was enhanced by overexpression of genes for the shikimate pathway and the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. Subsequently, to improve the availability of the key aromatics precursor phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) toward shikimate synthesis, the PEP: sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) was inactivated and an endogenous myo-inositol transporter IolT1 and glucokinases were overexpressed. Unexpectedly, the resultant non-PTS strain accumulated 1,3-dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and glycerol as major byproducts. This observation and metabolome analysis identified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)-catalyzed reaction as a limiting step in glycolysis. Consistently, overexpression of GAPDH significantly stimulated both glucose consumption and shikimate production. Blockage of the DHA synthesis further improved shikimate yield. We applied an aerobic, growth-arrested and high-density cell reaction to the shikimate production by the resulting strain and notably achieved the highest shikimate titer (141 g/l) and a yield (51% (mol/mol)) from glucose reported to date after 48 h in minimal medium lacking nutrients required for cell growth. Moreover, comparable shikimate productivity could be attained through simultaneous utilization of glucose, xylose, and arabinose, enabling efficient shikimate production from lignocellulosic feedstocks.

To test this hypothesis, an NADPH consumption pathway was constructed in cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) interference (CRISPRi) is emerging as a promising tool for transcriptional modulation. In this study, we developed a regulatable CRISPRi system for fine-tuning biosynthetic pathways and thus directing carbon flux toward target product synthesis. By exploiting engineered Escherichia coli harboring a biosynthetic mevalonate (MVA) pathway and plant-derived terpenoid synthases, the CRISPRi system successfully modulated the expression of all the MVA pathway genes in the context of operon and blocked the transcription of the acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the MVA pathway. This CRISPRi-guided balancing of expression of MVA pathway genes led to enhanced production of (-)-α-bisabolol (C15) and lycopene (C40) and alleviation of cell growth inhibition that may be caused by expression of multiple enzymes or production of toxic intermediate metabolites in the MVA pathway. Coupling CRISPRi to cell growth by regulating an endogenous essential gene (ispA) increased isoprene (C5) production. The regulatable CRISPRi system proved to be a robust platform for systematic modulation of biosynthetic and endogenous gene expression, and can be used to tune biosynthetic metabolic pathways.

However, the key mechanism of improved xylose utilization and xylose isomerase activity was not identified. In this study, we applied the concept of inverse metabolic engineering to identify the factors involved in improving xylose utilization. Genomic sequencing of the evolved strain with fast xylose utilization capability was performed, and mutations possibly affecting xylose utilization were screened. Further genetic analysis of these mutant genes revealed that mutations in ASK10 (both the site-directed mutation ASK10M475R as well as ASK10 deletion), a stress response regulator-encoding gene, improved growth on xylose and enhanced xylose isomerase activity. We found that mutation of Ask10p did not increase xylose isomerase activity through interacting with the xylose isomerase protein or through directly regulating the xylA gene transcription. Although ASK10 deletion increased the copy number of the plasmid and improved the transcription of xylA, the site-direct mutation ASK10M475R did not change the plasmid copy number. Interestingly, we found that both the site-directed mutation ASK10M475R and ASK10 deletion up-regulated the transcription of molecular chaperone-encoding genes HSP26, SSA1 and HSP104, thereby facilitating the protein folding of xylose isomerase and enhancing xylose isomerase activity.

This nonphosphorylative metabolism is orthogonal to the intrinsic pentose metabolism in Escherichia coli and has fewer enzymatic steps and a higher theoretical yield to TCA cycle intermediates than the pentose phosphate pathway. Here mesaconate production was enabled from the d-xylose pathway and the l-arabinose pathway. To enhance the transportation of d-xylose and l-arabinose, pentose transporters were examined. We identified the pentose/proton symporter, AraE, as the most effective transporter for both d-xylose and l-arabinose in mesaconate production process. Further production optimization was achieved by operon screening and metabolic engineering. These efforts led to the engineered strains that produced 12.5 g/l and 13.2 g/l mesaconate after 48 h from 20 g/l of d-xylose and l-arabinose, respectively.

Then, the ATP level was further increased by deletion of noxA (encoding NADH oxidase) and amn (encoding AMP nucleosidase), and overexpression of pgk (encoding 3-phosphoglycerate kinase) and pyk (encoding pyruvate kinase), and the l-arginine production and yield from glucose were significantly increased.

This aromatic compound is currently manufactured from petroleum-derived materials by chemical synthesis. To produce PABA from renewable resources, its production by fermentation was investigated. The evaluation of the sensitivity to PABA toxicity revealed that Corynebacterium glutamicum had better tolerance to PABA than several other microorganisms. To produce PABA from glucose, genetically engineered C. glutamicum was constructed by introducing both pabAB and pabC. The generated strain produced 20 mM of PABA in a test-tube scale culture; however, during the investigation, an unidentified major byproduct was detected in the culture supernatant. Unexpectedly, the byproduct was also detected after the incubation of PABA with glucose in a buffer solution without bacterial cells. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the formation of this byproduct, PABA analogues and several kinds of sugars were mixed and analyzed. New chemical compounds were detected when incubating aniline with glucose as well as PABA with reducing sugars (mannose, xylose, or arabinose), indicating that an amino group of PABA reacted non-enzymatically with an aldehyde group of glucose. The molecular mass of the byproduct determined by LC-MS suggested that the molecule was generated from PABA and glucose with releasing a water molecule, generally known as a glycation product. Because the glycation reaction was reversible, the byproduct was easily converted to PABA by acid treatment (around pH 2-3) with HCl. Then, pab genes were screened to improve PABA production. The highest PABA concentration was achieved by a strain expressing the pabAB of Corynebacterium callunae and a strain expressing the pabC of Xenorhabdus bovienii, respectively.

Here, we report the expression of a patchoulol synthase from Pogostemon cablin Benth in the model green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The sesquiterpenoid patchoulol was produced from the alga and was used as a marker of sesquiterpenoid production capacity. A novel strategy for gene loading was employed and patchoulol was produced up to 922±242 µg g−1 CDW in six days. We additionally investigated the effect of carbon source on sesquiterpenoid productivity from C. reinhardtii in scale-up batch cultivations. It was determined that up to 1.03 mg L−1 sesquiterpenoid products could be produced in completely photoautotrophic conditions and that the alga exhibited altered sesquiterpenoid production metabolism related to carbon source.",

     "abstract": "The performance of Corynebacterium glutamicum cell factories producing compounds which rely heavily on NADPH has been reported to depend on the sugar being metabolized. While some aspects of this phenomenon have been elucidated, there are still many unresolved questions as to how sugar metabolism is linked to redox and to the general metabolism. We here provide new insights into the regulation of the metabolism of this important platform organism by systematically characterizing mutants carrying various lesions in the fructose operon. Initially, we found that a strain where the dedicated fructose uptake system had been inactivated (KO-ptsF) was hampered in growth on sucrose minimal medium, and suppressor mutants appeared readily. Comparative genomic analysis in conjunction with enzymatic assays revealed that suppression was linked to inactivation of the pfkB gene, encoding a fructose-1-phosphate kinase. Detailed characterization of KO-ptsF, KO-pfkB and double knock-out (DKO) derivatives revealed a strong role for sugar-phosphates, especially fructose-1-phosphate (F1P), in governing sugar as well as redox metabolism due to effects on transcriptional regulation of key genes. These findings allowed us to propose a simple model explaining the correlation between sugar phosphate concentration, gene expression and ultimately the observed phenotype. To guide us in our analysis and help us identify bottlenecks in metabolism we debugged an existing genome-scale model onto which we overlaid the transcriptome data. Based on the results obtained we managed to enhance the NADPH supply and transform the wild-type strain into delivering the highest yield of lysine ever obtained on sucrose and fructose, thus providing a good example of how regulatory mechanisms can be harnessed for bioproduction.",

Five sgRNAs associated with CRISPRi were designed and synthesized, respectively, to target five various locations on genes ftsZ or mreB encoded in the E. coli chromosome, resulting in various reduced expression levels of ftsZ or/and mreB, respectively, forming elongated or/and fatter cells. Repressions on gene expressions of ftsZ or/and mreB could be further intensified by combining various sgRNAs together. It was found that the stronger the repression on genes ftsZ or/and mreB, the longer the E. coli fibers, and the larger the E. coli cells. Combined repressions on expressions of ftsZ and mreB generated long and larger E. coli with diverse morphologies including various sizes of gourds, bars, coccus, spindles, multi-angles and ellipsoids.

The most commonly studied syngas fermenting bacterium is Clostridium ljungdahlii, which produces acetate and ethanol as its primary metabolic byproducts. Engineering of C. ljungdahlii metabolism to overproduce ethanol, enhance the synthesize of the native byproducts lactate and 2,3-butanediol, and introduce the synthesis of non-native products such as butanol and butyrate has substantial commercial value. We performed in silico metabolic engineering studies using a genome-scale reconstruction of C. ljungdahlii metabolism and the OptKnock computational framework to identify gene knockouts that were predicted to enhance the synthesis of these native products and non-native products, introduced through insertion of the necessary heterologous pathways. The OptKnock derived strategies were often difficult to assess because increase product synthesis was invariably accompanied by decreased growth. Therefore, the OptKnock strategies were further evaluated using a spatiotemporal metabolic model of a syngas bubble column reactor, a popular technology for large-scale gas fermentation. Unlike flux balance analysis, the bubble column model accounted for the complex tradeoffs between increased product synthesis and reduced growth rates of engineered mutants within the spatially varying column environment. The two-stage methodology for deriving and evaluating metabolic engineering strategies was shown to yield new C. ljungdahlii gene targets that offer the potential for increased product synthesis under realistic syngas fermentation conditions.",

First, the implementation of the synthetic lycopene production pathway as a model system and the amplification of the native DXP pathway were accomplished using synthetic constitutive promoters and redesigned 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTRs). Next, fine-controlled precursor balancing was investigated by tuning phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (PpsA) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The results showed that tuning-down of gapA improved the specific lycopene content by 45% compared to the overexpression of ppsA. The specific lycopene content in the strains with down-regulated gapA increased by 97% compared to that in the parental strain.

Here we report development of a high-yield homo-SA producing Mannheimia succiniciproducens strain by metabolic engineering. The PALFK strain (ldhA-, pta-, ackA-, fruA-) was developed based on optimization of carbon flux towards SA production while minimizing byproducts formation through the integrated application of in silico genome-scale metabolic flux analysis, omics analyses, and reconstruction of central carbon metabolism. Based on in silico simulation, utilization of sucrose would enhance the SA production and cell growth rates, while consumption of glycerol would reduce the byproduct formation rates. Thus, sucrose and glycerol were selected as dual carbon sources to improve the SA yield and productivity, while deregulation of catabolite-repression was also performed in engineered M. succiniciproducens. Fed-batch fermentations of PALFK with low- and medium-density (OD600 of 0.4 and 9.0, respectively) inocula produced 69.2 and 78.4 g/L of homo-SA with yields of 1.56 and 1.64 mol/mol glucose equivalent and overall volumetric SA productivities of 2.50 and 6.02 g/L/h, respectively, using sucrose and glycerol as dual carbon sources. The SA productivity could be further increased to 38.6 g/L/h by employing a membrane cell recycle bioreactor system.

Along with itaconate, U. maydis also produces 2-hydroxyparaconate. The latter was proposed to be derived from itaconate, but the underlying biochemistry and associated genes were thus far unknown. Here, we confirm that 2-hydroxyparaconate is a secondary metabolite of U. maydis and propose an extension of U. maydis’ itaconate pathway from itaconate to 2-hydroxyparaconate. This conversion is catalyzed by the P450 monooxygenase Cyp3, encoded by cyp3, a gene, which is adjacent to the itaconate gene cluster of U. maydis. By deletion of cyp3 and simultaneous overexpression of the gene cluster regulator ria1, it was possible to generate an itaconate hyper producer strain, which produced up to 4.5–fold more itaconate in comparison to the wildtype without the by-product 2-hydroxyparaconate. By adjusting culture conditions in controlled pulsed fed-batch fermentations, a product to substrate yield of 67% of the theoretical maximum was achieved. In all, the titer, rate and yield of itaconate produced by U. maydis was considerably increased, thus contributing to the industrial application of this unicellular fungus for the biotechnological production of this valuable biomass derived chemical.",

However, the industrial platform organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae naturally uses an FAD-dependent pathway for glycerol catabolism transferring the electrons to the respiratory chain. Here, we developed a pathway replacement strategy forcing glycerol catabolism through a synthetic, NAD+-dependent route. The required expression cassettes were integrated via CRISPR-Cas9 targeting the endogenous GUT1 locus, thereby abolishing the native FAD-dependent pathway. Interestingly, this pathway replacement even established growth in synthetic glycerol medium of strains naturally unable to grow on glycerol and an engineered derivative of CEN.PK even showed the highest ever reported maximum specific growth rate on glycerol (0.26 h−1).",

Folates are involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of nucleotides and amino acids, as well as supplying methyl groups to a broad range of substrates, such as hormones, DNA, proteins, and lipids, as part of the methyl cycle. Humans and animals cannot synthesize folic acid and, therefore, need them in the diet. Folic acid deficiency is an important and underestimated problem of micronutrient malnutrition affecting billions of people worldwide. Therefore, the addition of folic acid as food additive has become mandatory in many countries thus contributing to a growing demand of the vitamin. At present, folic acid is exclusively produced by chemical synthesis despite its associated environmental burdens. In this work, we have metabolically engineered the industrial fungus Ashbya gossypii in order to explore its potential as a natural producer of folic acid. Overexpression of FOL genes greatly enhanced the synthesis of folates and identified GTP cyclohydrolase I as the limiting step. Metabolic flux redirection from competing pathways also stimulated folic acid production. Finally, combinatorial engineering synergistically increased the production of different bioactive forms of the folic vitamin. Overall, strains were constructed which produce 146-fold (6595 µg/L) more vitamin than the wild-type and by far represents the highest yield reported.",

In this study, the suppressor mutation was identified to be a point mutation in rho encoding the transcription termination factor Rho. Strain RE2 still showed retarded growth despite the mutation rho696. Our strategy for reconciling improved growth with a high level of l-lysine production was to use GapA together with GapN only in the early growth phase, and subsequently shift this combination-type glycolysis to one that depends only on GapN in the rest of the growth phase. To achieve this, we expressed gapA under the myo-inositol-inducible promoter of iolT1 encoding a myo-inositol transporter in strain RE2. The resulting strain RE2Aiol was engineered into an l-lysine producer by introduction of a plasmid carrying the desensitized lysC, followed by examination for culture conditions with myo-inositol supplementation. We found that as a higher concentration of myo-inositol was added to the seed culture, the following fermentation period became shorter while maintaining a high level of l-lysine production. This finally reached a fermentation period comparable to that of the control GapA strain, and yielded a 1.5-fold higher production rate compared with strain RE2. The transcript level of gapA, as well as the GapA activity, in the early growth phase increased in proportion to the myo-inositol concentration and then fell to low levels in the subsequent growth phase, indicating that improved growth was a result of increased GapA activity, especially in the early growth phase. Moreover, blockade of the pentose phosphate pathway through a defect in glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase did not significantly affect l-lysine production in the engineered GapN strains, while a drastic decrease in l-lysine production was observed for the control GapA strain. Determination of the intracellular NADPH/NADP+ ratios revealed that the ratios in the engineered strains were significantly higher than the ratio of the control GapA strain irrespective of the pentose phosphate pathway. These results demonstrate that our strain engineering strategy allows efficient l-lysine production independent of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway.",

This dual control system is completely silent in the off stage and is coupled to the regulation of gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. This system also functions as an AND gate. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the cumate-riboswitch dual control system for the control of pamamycin production in Streptomyces albus. Placing the cre recombinase gene under the control of this system permitted the construction of synthetic devices with non-volatile memory that sense the signal and respond by altering DNA at the chromosomal level, thereby producing changes that are heritable. In addition, we present a library of synthetic inducible promoters based on the previously described cumate switch. With only one inducer and different promoters, we demonstrate that simultaneous modulation of the expression of several genes to different levels in various operons is possible. Because all modules of the AND gates are functional in bacteria other than Streptomyces, we anticipate that these regulatory devices can be used to control gene expression in other Actinobacteria. The features described in this study make these systems promising tools for metabolic engineering and biotechnology in Actinobacteria.",

Their biosynthesis involves class I diterpene synthases (DTSs), whose activity can be preceded by that of class II diterpene cyclases (DTCs). Here, a modular metabolic engineering system was used to examine the promiscuity of DTSs. Strikingly, both a bacterial and plant DTS were found to exhibit extreme promiscuity, reacting with all available precursors with orthogonal activity, producing an olefin or hydroxyl group, respectively. Such DTS promiscuity enables combinatorial biosynthesis, with remarkably high yields for these unoptimized non-native enzymatic combinations (up to 15 mg/L). Indeed, it was possible to readily characterize the 13 unknown products. Notably, 16 of the observed diterpenes were previously inaccessible, and these results provide biosynthetic routes that are further expected to enable assembly of more extended pathways to produce additionally elaborated ‘non-natural’ diterpenoids.",

There is no direct natural reservoir for long chain fatty alcohol production, thus many groups explored metabolic engineering approaches for its microbial production. Escherichia coli has been the major microbial platform for this effort, however, terminal endogenous enzyme responsible for converting fatty aldehydes of chain length C14-C18 to corresponding fatty alcohols is still been elusive. Through our in silico analysis we selected 35 endogenous enzymes of E. coli having potential of converting long chain fatty aldehydes to fatty alcohols and studied their role under in vivo condition. We found that deletion of ybbO gene, which encodes NADP+ dependent aldehyde reductase, led to >90% reduction in long chain fatty alcohol production. This feature was found to be strain transcending and reinstalling ybbO gene via plasmid retained the ability of mutant to produce long chain fatty alcohols. Enzyme kinetic study revealed that YbbO has wide substrate specificity ranging from C6 to C18 aldehyde, with maximum affinity and efficiency for C18 and C16 chain length aldehyde, respectively. Along with endogenous production of fatty aldehyde via optimized heterologous expression of cyanobaterial acyl-ACP reductase (AAR), YbbO overexpression resulted in 169 mg/L of long chain fatty alcohols. Further engineering involving modulation of fatty acid as well as of phospholipid biosynthesis pathway improved fatty alcohol production by 60%. Finally, the engineered strain produced 1989 mg/L of long chain fatty alcohol in bioreactor under fed-batch cultivation condition. Our study shows for the first time a predominant role of a single enzyme in production of long chain fatty alcohols from fatty aldehydes as well as of modulation of phospholipid pathway in increasing the fatty alcohol production.",

To generate the strain, T. thermophilus HB8 was first evolved on glucose to improve its growth characteristics, followed by evolution on xylose. The resulting strain, T. thermophilus LC113, was characterized in growth studies, by whole genome sequencing, and 13C-metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) with [1,6-13C]glucose, [5-13C]xylose, and [1,6-13C]glucose+[5-13C]xylose as isotopic tracers. Compared to the starting strain, the evolved strain had an increased growth rate (~2-fold), increased biomass yield, increased tolerance to high temperatures up to 90 °C, and gained the ability to grow on xylose in minimal medium. At the optimal growth temperature of 81 °C, the maximum growth rate on glucose and xylose was 0.44 and 0.46 h−1, respectively. In medium containing glucose and xylose the strain efficiently co-utilized the two sugars. 13C-MFA results provided insights into the metabolism of T. thermophilus LC113 that allows efficient co-utilization of glucose and xylose. Specifically, 13C-MFA revealed that metabolic fluxes in the upper part of metabolism adjust flexibly to sugar availability, while fluxes in the lower part of metabolism remain relatively constant. Whole genome sequence analysis revealed two large structural changes that can help explain the physiology of the evolved strain: a duplication of a chromosome region that contains many sugar transporters, and a 5x multiplication of a region on the pVV8 plasmid that contains xylose isomerase and xylulokinase genes, the first two enzymes of xylose catabolism. Taken together, 13C-MFA and genome sequence analysis provided complementary insights into the physiology of the evolved strain.",

     "abstract": "The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a fundamental component of cellular metabolism. It provides precursors for the biosynthesis of nucleotides and contributes to the production of reducing power in the form of NADPH. It has been hypothesized that mammalian cells may contain a hidden reaction in PPP catalyzed by transketolase-like protein 1 (TKTL1) that is closely related to the classical transketolase enzyme; however, until now there has been no direct experimental evidence for this reaction. In this work, we have applied state-of-the-art techniques in 13C metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) based on parallel labeling experiments and integrated flux fitting to estimate the TKTL1 flux in CHO cells. We identified a set of three parallel labeling experiments with [1-13C]glucose+[4,5,6-13C]glucose, [2-13C]glucose+[4,5,6-13C]glucose, and [3-13C]glucose+[4,5,6-13C]glucose and developed a new method to measure 13C-labeling of fructose 6-phosphate by GC-MS that allows intuitive interpretation of mass isotopomer distributions to determine key fluxes in the model, including glycolysis, oxidative PPP, non-oxidative PPP, and the TKTL1 flux. Using these tracers we detected a significant TKTL1 flux in CHO cells at the stationary phase. The flux results suggest that the main function of oxidative PPP in CHO cells at the stationary phase is to fuel the TKTL1 reaction. Overall, this study demonstrates for the first time that carbon atoms can be lost in the PPP, by means other than the oxidative PPP, and that this loss of carbon atoms is consistent with the hypothesized TKTL1 reaction in mammalian cells.",

In this work, we engineered both the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway and the mevalonate (MVA) pathway for isoprene production in E. coli. The synergy between the MEP pathway and the MVA pathway was demonstrated by the production experiment, in which overexpression of both pathways improved the isoprene yield about 20-fold and 3-fold, respectively, compared to overexpression of the MEP pathway or the MVA pathway alone. The 13C metabolic flux analysis revealed that simultaneous utilization of the two pathways resulted in a 4.8-fold increase in the MEP pathway flux and a 1.5-fold increase in the MVA pathway flux. The synergy of the dual pathway was further verified by quantifying intracellular flux responses of the MEP pathway and the MVA pathway to fosmidomycin treatment and mevalonate supplementation. Our results strongly suggest that coupling of the complementary reducing equivalent demand and ATP requirement plays an important role in the synergy of the dual pathway. Fed-batch cultivation of the engineered strain overexpressing the dual pathway resulted in production of 24.0 g/L isoprene with a yield of 0.267 g/g of glucose.

Many current and potential products of this yeast require acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) as a precursor and pathways towards these products are generally expressed in its cytosol. The native S. cerevisiae pathway for production of cytosolic acetyl-CoA consumes 2 ATP equivalents in the acetyl-CoA synthetase reaction. Catabolism of additional sugar substrate, which may be required to generate this ATP, negatively affects product yields. Here, we review alternative pathways that can be engineered into yeast to optimize supply of cytosolic acetyl-CoA as a precursor for product formation. Particular attention is paid to reaction stoichiometry, free-energy conservation and redox-cofactor balancing of alternative pathways for acetyl-CoA synthesis from glucose. A theoretical analysis of maximally attainable yields on glucose of four compounds (n-butanol, citric acid, palmitic acid and farnesene) showed a strong product dependency of the optimal pathway configuration for acetyl-CoA synthesis. Moreover, this analysis showed that combination of different acetyl-CoA production pathways may be required to achieve optimal product yields.

Firstly, the ectABC gene cluster from Halomonas elongata was introduced into E. coli W3110 and the resultant strain synthesized 4.9 g/L ectoine without high osmolarity. Subsequently, thrA encoding the bifunctional aspartokinase/homoserine dehydrogenase was deleted to weaken the competitive l-threonine branch, resulting in an increase of ectoine titer by 109%. Furthermore, a feedback resistant lysC from Corynebacterium glutamicum encoding the aspartate kinase was introduced to complement the enzymatic activity deficiency caused by thrA deletion and a 9% increase of ectoine titer was obtained. Finally, the promoter of ppc that encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase was replaced by a trc promoter, and iclR, a glyoxylate shunt transcriptional repressor gene, was deleted.

We utilized B. megaterium’s endogenous 20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20βHSD) for the efficient production of both progestogens after genetically modifying the microorganism to reduce side-product formation. First, the gene encoding the autologous cytochrome P450 CYP106A1 was deleted, resulting in a strain devoid of any steroid hydroxylation activity. Cultivation of this strain in the presence of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17αOH-P) led to the formation of 17α,20α-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17α,20αDiOH-P) as a major and 17α,20βDiOH-P as a minor product. Four enzymes were identified as 20αHSDs and their genes deleted to yield a strain with no 20αHSD activity. The 3-oxoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase FabG was found to exhibit 20βHSD-activity and overexpressed to create a biocatalyst yielding 0.22 g/L 17α,20βDiOH-P and 0.34 g/L 20βOH-RSS after 8 h using shake-flask cultivation, thus obtaining products that are at least a thousand times more expensive than their substrates.",

The acetone production operon (APO) containing the genes thlA (encoding thiolase A), ctfA/ctfB (encoding CoA transferase), and adc (encoding acetoacetate decarboxylase) from Clostridium acetobutylicum were cloned under the control of the thlA promoter into four vectors having different replicons for Gram-positives (pIP404, pBP1, pCB102, and pCD6). Stable replication was observed for all constructs. A. woodii [pJIR_actthlA] achieved the maximal acetone concentration under autotrophic conditions (15.2±3.4 mM). Promoter sequences of the genes ackA from A. woodii and pta-ack from C. ljungdahlii were determined by primer extension (PEX) and cloned upstream of the APO. The highest acetone production in recombinant A. woodii cells was achieved using the promoters PthlA and Ppta-ack. Batch fermentations using A. woodii [pMTL84151_actthlA] in a bioreactor revealed that acetate concentration had an effect on the acetone production, due to the high Km value of the CoA transferase. In order to establish consistent acetate concentration within the bioreactor and to increase biomass, a continuous fermentation process for A. woodii was developed. Thus, acetone productivity of the strain A. woodii [pMTL84151_actthlA] was increased from 1.2 mg L−1 h−1 in bottle fermentation to 26.4 mg L−1 h−1 in continuous gas fermentation.",

A genome-wide genetic mapping experiment using pooled-segregant whole-genome sequence analysis was conducted, and one major and several minor genetic loci were identified responsible for the superior glycerol growth phenotype of the previously selected S. cerevisiae strain CBS 6412-13A. Downscaling of the major locus by fine-mapping and reciprocal hemizygosity analysis allowed the parallel identification of two superior alleles (UBR2CBS 6412-13A and SSK1CBS 6412-13A). These alleles together with the previously identified GUT1CBS 6412-13A allele were used to replace the corresponding alleles in the strain CEN.PK113-1A.

     "abstract": "Synthesis of polyketides at high titer and yield is important for producing pharmaceuticals and biorenewable chemical precursors. In this work, we engineered cofactor and transport pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to increase acetyl-CoA, an important polyketide building block. The highly regulated yeast pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass pathway was supplemented by overexpressing a modified Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHm) that accepts NADP+ for acetyl-CoA production. After 24 h of cultivation, a 3.7-fold increase in NADPH/NADP+ ratio was observed relative to the base strain, and a 2.2-fold increase relative to introduction of the native E. coli PDH. Both E. coli pathways increased acetyl-CoA levels approximately 2-fold relative to the yeast base strain. Combining PDHm with a ZWF1 deletion to block the major yeast NADPH biosynthesis pathway resulted in a 12-fold NADPH boost and a 2.2-fold increase in acetyl-CoA. At 48 h, only this coupled approach showed increased acetyl-CoA levels, 3.0-fold higher than that of the base strain. The impact on polyketide synthesis was evaluated in a S. cerevisiae strain expressing the Gerbera hybrida 2-pyrone synthase (2-PS) for the production of the polyketide triacetic acid lactone (TAL). Titers of TAL relative to the base strain improved only 30% with the native E. coli PDH, but 3.0-fold with PDHm and 4.4-fold with PDHm in the Δzwf1 strain. Carbon was further routed toward TAL production by reducing mitochondrial transport of pyruvate and acetyl-CoA; deletions in genes POR2, MPC2, PDA1, or YAT2 each increased titer 2–3-fold over the base strain (up to 0.8 g/L), and in combination to 1.4 g/L. Combining the two approaches (NADPH-generating acetyl-CoA pathway plus reduced metabolite flux into the mitochondria) resulted in a final TAL titer of 1.6 g/L, a 6.4-fold increase over the non-engineered yeast strain, and 35% of theoretical yield (0.16 g/g glucose), the highest reported to date.

In this work, we present a new approach to produce α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids (α,β-UCAs) using an engineered reversal of the β-oxidation (r-BOX) cycle. To increase the availability of both acyl-CoAs and enoyl-CoAs for α,β-UCA production, we use an engineered Escherichia coli strain devoid of mixed-acid fermentation pathways and known thioesterases. Core genes for r-BOX such as thiolase, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, and enoyl-CoA reductase were chromosomally overexpressed under the control of a cumate inducible phage promoter. Native E. coli thioesterase YdiI was used as the cycle-terminating enzyme, as it was found to have not only the ability to convert trans-enoyl-CoAs to the corresponding α,β-UCAs, but also a very low catalytic efficiency on acetyl-CoA, the primer and extender unit for the r-BOX pathway. Coupling of r-BOX with YdiI led to crotonic acid production at titers reaching 1.5 g/L in flask cultures and 3.2 g/L in a controlled bioreactor. The engineered r-BOX pathway was also used to achieve for the first time the production of 2-hexenoic acid, 2-octenoic acid, and 2-decenoic acid at a final titer of 0.2 g/L. The superior nature of the engineered pathway was further validated through the use of in silico metabolic flux analysis, which showed the ability of r-BOX to support growth-coupled production of α,β-UCAs with a higher ATP efficiency than the widely used fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that r-BOX could be an ideal platform to implement the biological production of α,β-UCAs.",

As dihomo-methionine is the precursor amino acid for glucoraphanin production, a first challenge is to establish an expression system for production of dihomo-methionine. In planta, the methionine chain elongation enzymes are physically separated within the cell with the first enzyme in the cytosol while the rest are located in the chloroplast. A de-compartmentalization approach was applied to produce dihomo-methionine by expression of the respective plant genes in Escherichia coli cytosol. Introduction of two plasmids encoding the methionine chain elongation pathway into E. coli resulted in production of 25 mg L−1 of dihomo-methionine. In addition to chain-elongated methionine products, side-products from chain elongation of leucine were produced. Methionine supplementation enhanced dihomo-methionine production to 57 mg L−1, while keeping a steady level of the chain-elongated leucine products.

In order to increase the yield of lactic acid further, the ethanol production pathway was attenuated by disrupting the pyruvate decarboxylase1 (PDC1) and alcohol dehydrogenase1 (ADH1) genes. Despite an increase in lactic acid yield, severe reduction of the growth rate and glucose consumption rate owing to the absence of ADH1 caused a considerable decrease in the overall productivity. In Δadh1 cells, the levels of acetyl-CoA, a key precursor for biologically applicable components, could be insufficient for normal cell growth. To increase the cellular supply of acetyl-CoA, we introduced bacterial acetylating acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (A-ALD) enzyme (EC 1.2.1.10) genes into the lactic acid-producing S. cerevisiae. Escherichia coli-derived A-ALD genes, mhpF and eutE, were expressed and effectively complemented the attenuated acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALD)/acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) pathway in the yeast. The engineered strain, possessing a heterologous acetyl-CoA synthetic pathway, showed an increased glucose consumption rate and higher productivity of lactic acid fermentation.

It consists of three sequential functional units, encoded by the dszABCD genes, through which the model compound dibenzothiophene (DBT) is transformed into the sulfur-free 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2HBP) molecule. In this work, a set of synthetic dsz cassettes were implanted in Pseudomonas putida KT2440, a model bacterial “chassis” for metabolic engineering studies. The complete dszB1A1C1-D1 cassette behaved as an attractive alternative — to the previously constructed recombinant dsz cassettes — for the conversion of DBT into 2HBP. Refactoring the 4S pathway by the use of synthetic dsz modules encoding individual 4S pathway reactions revealed unanticipated traits, e.g., the 4S intermediate 2HBP-sulfinate (HBPS) behaves as an inhibitor of the Dsz monooxygenases, and once secreted from the cells it cannot be further taken up. That issue should be addressed for the rational design of more efficient biocatalysts for DBT bioconversions. In this sense, the construction of synthetic bacterial consortia to compartmentalize the 4S pathway into different cell factories for individual optimization was shown to enhance the conversion of DBT into 2HBP, overcome the inhibition of the Dsz enzymes by the 4S intermediates, and enable efficient production of unattainable high added value intermediates, e.g., HBPS, that are difficult to obtain using the current monocultures.",

Microbial co-cultures have the ability to distribute metabolic burden and allow for modular specific optimization in a way that is not possible through traditional monoculture fermentation methods. Here, we present an Escherichia coli co-culture for the efficient production of flavonoids in vivo, resulting in a 970-fold improvement in titer of flavan-3-ols over previously published monoculture production. To accomplish this improvement in titer, factors such as strain compatibility, carbon source, temperature, induction point, and inoculation ratio were initially optimized. The development of an empirical scaled-Gaussian model based on the initial optimization data was then implemented to predict the optimum point for the system. Experimental verification of the model predictions resulted in a 65% improvement in titer, to 40.7±0.1 mg/L flavan-3-ols, over the previous optimum. Overall, this study demonstrates the first application of the co-culture production of flavonoids, the most in-depth co-culture optimization to date, and the first application of empirical systems modeling for improvement of titers from a co-culture system.",

     "abstract": "Metabolic engineering uses microorganisms to synthesize chemicals from renewable resources. Given the thousands of known metabolites, it is unclear what valuable chemicals could be produced by a microorganism and what native and heterologous reactions are needed for their synthesis. To answer these questions, a systematic computational assessment of Escherichia coli’s potential ability to produce different chemicals was performed using an integrated metabolic model that included native E.coli reactions and known heterologous reactions. By adding heterologous reactions, a total of 1777 non-native products could theoretically be produced in E. coli under glucose minimal medium conditions, of which 279 non-native products have commercial applications. Synthesis pathways involving native and heterologous reactions were identified from eight central metabolic precursors to the 279 non-native commercial products. These pathways were used to evaluate the dependence on, and diversity of, native and heterologous reactions to produce each non-native commercial product, as well as to identify each product׳s closest central metabolic precursor. Analysis of the synthesis pathways (with 5 or fewer reaction steps) to non-native commercial products revealed that isopentenyl diphosphate, pyruvate, and oxaloacetate are the closest central metabolic precursors to the most non-native commercial products. Additionally, 4-hydroxybenzoate, tyrosine, and phenylalanine were found to be common precursors to a large number of non-native commercial products. Strains capable of producing high levels of these precursors could be further engineered to create strains capable of producing a variety of commercial non-native chemicals.",

Currently, 3PPA and HPPA are mainly manufactured through chemical synthesis, which contains multiple steps involving toxic solvents and catalysts harmful to environment. Therefore, replacement of such existing petroleum-derived approaches with simple and environmentally friendly biological processes is highly desirable for manufacture of these chemicals. Here, for the first time we demonstrated the de novo biosynthesis of 3PPA and HPPA using simple carbon sources in E. coli by extending the cinnamic acids biosynthesis pathways through biological hydrogenation. We first screened 11 2-enoate reductases (ER) from nine microorganisms, leading to efficient conversion of cinnamic acid and p-coumaric acid to 3PPA and HPPA, respectively. Surprisingly, we found a strictly oxygen-sensitive Clostridia ER capable of functioning efficiently in E. coli even under aerobic conditions. On this basis, reconstitution of the full pathways led to the de novo production of 3PPA and HPPA and the accumulation of the intermediates (cinnamic acid and p-coumaric acid) with cell toxicity. To address this problem, different expression strategies were attempted to optimize individual enzyme׳s expression level and minimize intermediates accumulation. Finally, the titers of 3PPA and HPPA reached 366.77 mg/L and 225.10 mg/L in shake flasks, respectively. This study not only demonstrated the potential of microbial approach as an alternative to chemical process, but also proved the possibility of using oxygen-sensitive enzymes under aerobic conditions.",

For production of short chain fatty acids, membrane damage is considered the primary mechanism of toxicity, particularly in regards to membrane integrity. Previous engineering efforts in Escherichia coli to increase membrane integrity, with the goal of increasing fatty acid tolerance and production, have had mixed results. Herein, a novel approach was used to reconstruct the E. coli membrane by enabling production of a novel membrane component. Specifically, trans unsaturated fatty acids (TUFA) were produced and incorporated into the membrane of E. coli MG1655 by expression of cis-trans isomerase (Cti) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. While the engineered strain was found to have no increase in membrane integrity, a significant decrease in membrane fluidity was observed, meaning that membrane polarization and rigidity were increased by TUFA incorporation. As a result, tolerance to exogenously added octanoic acid and production of octanoic acid were both increased relative to the wild-type strain. This membrane engineering strategy to improve octanoic acid tolerance was found to require fine-tuning of TUFA abundance. Besides improving tolerance and production of carboxylic acids, TUFA production also enabled increased tolerance in E. coli to other bio-products, e.g. alcohols, organic acids, aromatic compounds, a variety of adverse industrial conditions, e.g. low pH, high temperature, and also elevated styrene production, another versatile bio-chemical product. TUFA permitted enhanced growth due to alleviation of bio–product toxicity, demonstrating the general effectiveness of this membrane engineering strategy towards improving strain robustness.",

The cellular efficiency of solventogenic clostridia, a group of anaerobes capable of producing a wealth of bulk chemicals and biofuels, must be improved for competitive commercialization. Here, using Clostridium acetobutylicum, a species of solventogenic clostridia, we revealed that the insufficient biosynthesis of biotin, a pivotal coenzyme for many important biological processes, is a major limiting bottleneck in this anaerobe’s performance. To address this problem, we strengthened the biotin synthesis of C. acetobutylicum by overexpressing four relevant genes involved in biotin transport and biosynthesis. This strategy led to faster growth and improved the titer and productivity of acetone, butanol and ethanol (ABE solvents) of C. acetobutylicum in both biotin-containing and biotin-free media. Expressionally modulating these four genes by modifying the ribosome binding site further promoted cellular performance, achieving ABE solvent titer and productivity as high as 21.9 g/L and 0.30 g/L/h, respectively, in biotin-free medium; these values exceeded those of the wild-type strain by over 30%. More importantly, biotin synthesis reinforcement also conferred improved ability of C. acetobutylicum to use hexose and pentose sugars, further demonstrating the potential of this metabolic-engineering strategy in solventogenic clostridia.",

With the growing availability of omics data and of methodologies capable to integrate the available data into models, mathematical modeling and computational analysis are becoming important in designing recombinant cellular organisms and optimizing cell performance with respect to desired criteria. In this contribution, we used the computational framework ORACLE (Optimization and Risk Analysis of Complex Living Entities) to analyze the physiology of recombinant Escherichia coli producing 1,4-butanediol (BDO) and to identify potential strategies for improved production of BDO. The framework allowed us to integrate data across multiple levels and to construct a population of large-scale kinetic models despite the lack of available information about kinetic properties of every enzyme in the metabolic pathways. We analyzed these models and we found that the enzymes that primarily control the fluxes leading to BDO production are part of central glycolysis, the lower branch of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the novel BDO production route. Interestingly, among the enzymes between the glucose uptake and the BDO pathway, the enzymes belonging to the lower branch of TCA cycle have been identified as the most important for improving BDO production and yield. We also quantified the effects of changes of the target enzymes on other intracellular states like energy charge, cofactor levels, redox state, cellular growth, and byproduct formation. Independent earlier experiments on this strain confirmed that the computationally obtained conclusions are consistent with the experimentally tested designs, and the findings of the present studies can provide guidance for future work on strain improvement.

A mevalonate (MVA)-based isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway for C5 alcohols was constructed in Escherichia coli using genes from several organisms, and the pathway was optimized to achieve over 50% theoretical yield. Although the MVA pathway is energetically less efficient than the native methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, implementing the MVA pathway in bacterial hosts such as E. coli is advantageous due to its lack of endogenous regulation. The MVA and MEP pathways intersect at isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), the direct precursor to isoprenoid-derived C5 alcohols and initial precursor to longer chain terpenes, which makes independent regulation of the pathways difficult. In pursuit of the complete “decoupling” of the MVA pathway from native cellular regulation, we designed novel IPP-bypass MVA pathways for C5 alcohol production by utilizing promiscuous activities of two enzymes, phosphomevalonate decarboxylase (PMD) and an E. coli-endogenous phosphatase (AphA). These bypass pathways have reduced energetic requirements, are further decoupled from intrinsic regulation, and are free from IPP-related toxicity. In addition to these benefits, we demonstrate that reduced aeration rate has less impact on the bypass pathway than the original MVA pathway. Finally, we showed that performance of the bypass pathway was primarily determined by the activity of PMD. We designed PMD mutants with improved activity and demonstrated titer increases in the mutant strains. These modified pathways would be a good platform for industrial production of isopentenol and related chemicals such as isoprene.",

In particular, we employed a combinatorial metabolic engineering approach to optimize the native Ehrlich pathway in S. cerevisiae. First, chromosome-based combinatorial gene overexpression led to a 28.7-fold increase in the titer of SBCFAs. Second, deletion of key genes in competing pathways improved the production of SBCFAs to 387.4 mg/L, a 31.2-fold increase compared to the wild-type. Third, overexpression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter PDR12 increased the secretion of SBCFAs. Taken together, we demonstrated that the combinatorial metabolic engineering approach used in this study effectively improved SBCFA biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae through the incorporation of a chromosome-based combinatorial gene overexpression strategy, elimination of genes in competitive pathways and overexpression of a native transporter.

These pathways were incorporated into Escherichia coli, and engineered strains produced ethylene glycol from various pentoses, including simultaneously from D-xylose and L-arabinose; one strain achieved the greatest reported titer of ethylene glycol, 40 g/L, from D-xylose at a yield of 0.35 g/g. The strategy was then extended to another compound, glycolate. Using D-xylose as the substrate, an engineered strain produced 40 g/L glycolate at a yield of 0.63 g/g, which is the greatest reported yield to date.",

     "abstract": "The deletion of PHO13 (pho13Δ) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, encoding a phosphatase enzyme of unknown specificity, results in the transcriptional activation of genes related to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) such as TAL1 encoding transaldolase. It has been also reported that the pho13Δ mutant of S. cerevisiae expressing a heterologous xylose pathway can metabolize xylose efficiently compared to its parental strain. However, the interaction between the pho13Δ–induced transcriptional changes and the phenotypes of xylose fermentation was not understood. Thus we investigated the global metabolic changes in response to pho13Δ when cells were exponentially growing on xylose. Among the 134 intracellular metabolites that we identified, the 98% reduction of sedoheptulose was found to be the most significant change in the pho13Δ mutant as compared to its parental strain. Because sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P), a substrate of transaldolase, reduced significantly in the pho13Δ mutant as well, we hypothesized that limited transaldolase activity in the parental strain might cause dephosphorylation of S7P, leading to carbon loss and inefficient xylose metabolism. Mutants overexpressing TAL1 at different degrees were constructed, and their TAL1 expression levels and xylose consumption rates were positively correlated. Moreover, as TAL1 expression levels increased, intracellular sedoheptulose concentration dropped significantly. Therefore, we concluded that TAL1 upregulation, preventing the accumulation of sedoheptulose, is the most critical mechanism for the improved xylose metabolism by the pho13Δ mutant of engineered S. cerevisiae.",

We have engineered Escherichia coli to selectively produce alkanes found in gasoline (propane, butane, pentane, heptane, and nonane) from renewable substrates such as glucose or glycerol. Our modular pathway framework achieves carbon-chain extension by two different mechanisms. A fatty acid synthesis route is used to generate longer chains heptane and nonane, while a more energy efficient alternative, reverse-β-oxidation, is used for synthesis of propane, butane, and pentane. We demonstrate that both upstream (thiolase) and intermediate (thioesterase) reactions can act as control points for chain-length specificity. Specific free fatty acids are subsequently converted to alkanes using a broad-specificity carboxylic acid reductase and a cyanobacterial aldehyde decarbonylase (AD). The selectivity obtained by different module pairings provides a foundation for tuning alkane product distribution for desired fuel properties. Alternate ADs that have greater activity on shorter substrates improve observed alkane titer. However, even in an engineered host strain that significantly reduces endogenous conversion of aldehyde intermediates to alcohol byproducts, AD activity is observed to be limiting for all chain lengths. Given these insights, we discuss guiding principles for pathway selection and potential opportunities for pathway improvement.",

FERM BP-3421 produces a suite of spliceostatin congeners with varying biological activities and physiological stabilities. Hemiketal compounds such as FR901464 were the first to be described. Due to its improved properties, we were particularly interested in a carboxylic acid precursor analog that was first reported from Burkholderia sp. MSMB 43 and termed thailanstatin A. Inactivation of the iron/α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase gene fr9P had been shown to block hemiketal biosynthesis. However, a 4-deoxy congener of thailanstatin A was the main product seen in the dioxygenase mutant. We show here that expression of the cytochrome P450 gene fr9R is a metabolic bottle neck, as use of an l-arabinose inducible system led to nearly complete conversion of the 4-deoxy analog to the target molecule. By integrating fermentation media development approaches with biosynthetic engineering, we were able to improve production titers of the target compound >40-fold, going from the starting ~60 mg/L to 2.5 g/L, and to achieve what is predominantly a single component production profile.

The pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis and TCA cycle were found to be highly active in Geobacillus LC300. The oxidative pentose phosphate pathway was also active and contributed significantly to NADPH production. No transhydrogenase activity was detected. Results from this work provide a solid foundation for future studies of this strain and its metabolic engineering and biotechnological applications.",

     "abstract": "Accurate determination of physiological states of cellular metabolism requires detailed information about metabolic fluxes, metabolite concentrations and distribution of enzyme states. Integration of fluxomics and metabolomics data, and thermodynamics-based metabolic flux analysis contribute to improved understanding of steady-state properties of metabolism. However, knowledge about kinetics and enzyme activities though essential for quantitative understanding of metabolic dynamics remains scarce and involves uncertainty. Here, we present a computational methodology that allow us to determine and quantify the kinetic parameters that correspond to a certain physiology as it is described by a given metabolic flux profile and a given metabolite concentration vector. Though we initially determine kinetic parameters that involve a high degree of uncertainty, through the use of kinetic modeling and machine learning principles we are able to obtain more accurate ranges of kinetic parameters, and hence we are able to reduce the uncertainty in the model analysis. We computed the distribution of kinetic parameters for glucose-fed E. coli producing 1,4-butanediol and we discovered that the observed physiological state corresponds to a narrow range of kinetic parameters of only a few enzymes, whereas the kinetic parameters of other enzymes can vary widely. Furthermore, this analysis suggests which are the enzymes that should be manipulated in order to engineer the reference state of the cell in a desired way. The proposed approach also sets up the foundations of a novel type of approaches for efficient, non-asymptotic, uniform sampling of solution spaces.",

Microbial production of resveratrol has until now been achieved by supplementation of expensive substrates, p-coumaric acid or aromatic amino acids.

First we introduced the biosynthetic pathway, consisting of tyrosine ammonia-lyase from Herpetosiphon aurantiacus, 4-coumaryl-CoA ligase from Arabidopsis thaliana and resveratrol synthase from Vitis vinifera, and obtained 2.73±0.05 mg L−1 resveratrol from glucose.

Next we improved the supply of the precursor malonyl-CoA by over-expressing a post-translational de-regulated version of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase encoding gene ACC1; this strategy further increased resveratrol production to 6.39±0.03 mg L−1. Subsequently, we improved the strain by performing multiple-integration of pathway genes resulting in resveratrol production of 235.57±7.00 mg L−1.

     "abstract": "Metabolic models used in 13C metabolic flux analysis generally include a limited number of reactions primarily from central metabolism. They typically omit degradation pathways, complete cofactor balances, and atom transition contributions for reactions outside central metabolism. This study addresses the impact on prediction fidelity of scaling-up mapping models to a genome-scale. The core mapping model employed in this study accounts for (75 reactions and 65 metabolites) primarily from central metabolism. The genome-scale metabolic mapping model (GSMM) (697 reaction and 595 metabolites) is constructed using as a basis the iAF1260 model upon eliminating reactions guaranteed not to carry flux based on growth and fermentation data for a minimal glucose growth medium. Labeling data for 17 amino acid fragments obtained from cells fed with glucose labeled at the second carbon was used to obtain fluxes and ranges. Metabolic fluxes and confidence intervals are estimated, for both core and genome-scale mapping models, by minimizing the sum of square of differences between predicted and experimentally measured labeling patterns using the EMU decomposition algorithm.Overall, we find that both topology and estimated values of the metabolic fluxes remain largely consistent between core and GSM model. Stepping up to a genome-scale mapping model leads to wider flux inference ranges for 20 key reactions present in the core model. The glycolysis flux range doubles due to the possibility of active gluconeogenesis, the TCA flux range expanded by 80% due to the availability of a bypass through arginine consistent with labeling data, and the transhydrogenase reaction flux was essentially unresolved due to the presence of as many as five routes for the inter-conversion of NADPH to NADH afforded by the genome-scale model. By globally accounting for ATP demands in the GSMM model the unused ATP decreased drastically with the lower bound matching the maintenance ATP requirement. A non-zero flux for the arginine degradation pathway was identified to meet biomass precursor demands as detailed in the iAF1260 model. Inferred ranges for 81% of the reactions in the genome-scale metabolic (GSM) model varied less than one-tenth of the basis glucose uptake rate (95% confidence test). This is because as many as 411 reactions in the GSM are growth coupled meaning that the single measurement of biomass formation rate locks the reaction flux values. This implies that accurate biomass formation rate and composition are critical for resolving metabolic fluxes away from central metabolism and suggests the importance of biomass composition (re)assessment under different genetic and environmental backgrounds. In addition, the loss of information associated with mapping fluxes from MFA on a core model to a GSM model is quantified.",

Strain AG553 showed a two- to threefold increase in ethanol yield relative to the wild type on all substrates tested. On defined medium, strain AG553 exceeded 70% of theoretical ethanol yield on lower loadings of the model crystalline cellulose Avicel, effectively eliminating formate, acetate, and lactate production and reducing H2 production by fivefold. On 5 g/L Avicel, strain AG553 reached an ethanol yield of 63.5% of the theoretical maximum compared with 19.9% by the wild type, and it showed similar yields on pretreated switchgrass and poplar. The elimination of organic acid production suggested that the strain might be capable of growth under higher substrate loadings in the absence of pH control. Final ethanol titer peaked at 73.4 mM in mutant AG553 on 20 g/L Avicel, at which point the pH decreased to a level that does not allow growth of C. thermocellum, likely due to CO2 accumulation. In comparison, the maximum titer of wild type C. thermocellum was 14.1 mM ethanol on 10 g/L Avicel. With the elimination of the metabolic pathways to all traditional fermentation products other than ethanol, AG553 is the best ethanol-yielding CBP strain to date and will serve as a platform strain for further metabolic engineering for the bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass.",

Here, we demonstrate the capacity to produce itaconic acid in Y. lipolytica through heterologous expression of the itaconic acid synthesis enzyme, resulting in an initial titer of 33 mg/L. Further optimizations of this strain via metabolic pathway engineering, enzyme localization, and media optimization strategies enabled 4.6 g/L of itaconic acid to be produced in bioreactors, representing a 140-fold improvement over initial titer. Moreover, these fermentation conditions did not require additional nutrient supplementation and utilized a low pH condition that enabled the acid form of itaconic acid to be produced. Overall yields (0.058 g/g yield from glucose) and maximum productivity of 0.045 g/L/h still provide areas for future strain improvement.

Based on quantified uptake and production rates, we could determine the contribution of different elementary flux modes to the metabolism of a substrate or substrate combination. ADP stimulated the uptake of most metabolites, directly by serving as substrate for the respiratory chain, thus removing the inhibitory effect of NADH, or as allosteric effector. Addition of ADP favored substrate metabolization to CO2 and did not enhance the production of other metabolites. The controlling effect of ADP was more pronounced when we supplied metabolites to the first part of the TCA cycle: pyruvate, citrate, α-ketoglutarate and glutamine. In the second part of the TCA cycle, the rates were primarily controlled by the concentrations of C4-dicarboxylates. Without ADP addition, the activity of the pyruvate carboxylase–malate dehydrogenase–malic enzyme cycle consumed the ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation, preventing its accumulation and maintaining metabolic steady state conditions. Aspartate was taken up only in combination with pyruvate, whose uptake also increased, a fact explained by complex regulatory effects. Isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase were identified as the key regulators of the TCA cycle, confirming existent knowledge from other cells.

Transformation of Synechocystis and heterologous expression of the β-phellandrene synthase (PHLS) gene alone is necessary and sufficient to confer to Synechocystis the ability to divert intermediate terpenoid metabolites and to generate the monoterpene β-phellandrene during photosynthesis. However, terpene synthases, including the PHLS, have a slow Kcat (low Vmax) necessitating high levels of enzyme concentration to enable meaningful rates and yield of product formation. Here, a novel approach was applied to increase the PHLS protein expression alleviating limitations in the rate and yield of β-phellandrene product generation. Different PHLS fusion constructs were generated with the Synechocystis endogenous cpcB sequence, encoding for the abundant in cyanobacteria phycocyanin β-subunit, expressed under the native cpc operon promoter. In one of these constructs, the CpcB·PHLS fusion protein accumulated to levels approaching 20% of the total cellular protein, i.e., substantially higher than expressing the PHLS protein alone under the same endogenous cpc promoter. The CpcB·PHLS fusion protein retained the activity of the PHLS enzyme and catalyzed β-phellandrene synthesis, yielding an average of 3.2 mg product g−1 dry cell weight (dcw) versus the 0.03 mg g−1 dcw measured with low-expressing constructs, i.e., a 100-fold yield improvement.

     "abstract": "Isotopomer spectral analysis (ISA) is a simple approach for modelling the cellular synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol in a stable isotope labelling experiment. In the simplest model, fatty acid biosynthesis is described by two key parameters: the fractional enrichment of acetyl-CoA from the labelled substrate, D, and the fractional de novo synthesis of the fatty acid during the exposure to the labelled substrate, g(t). The model can also be readily extended to include synthesis via elongation of unlabelled shorter fatty acids. This modelling strategy is less complex than metabolic flux analysis and only requires the measurement of the mass isotopologues of a single metabolite. However, software tools to perform these calculations are not freely available. We have developed an algorithm (convISA), implemented in MATLAB™, which employs the convolution (Cauchy product) of mass isotopologue distributions (MIDs) for ISA of fatty acids and cholesterol. In our method, the MIDs of each molecule are constructed as a single entity rather than deriving equations for individual isotopologues. The flexibility of this method allows the model to be applied to raw data as well as to data that has been corrected for natural isotope abundance. To test the algorithm, convISA was applied to 238 MIDs of methyl palmitate available from the literature, for which ISA parameters had been calculated via other methods. A very high correlation was observed between estimates of the D and g(t) parameters from convISA with both published values, and estimates generated by our own metabolic flux analysis using a simplified stoichiometric model (r=0.981 and 0.944, and 0.996 and 0.942). We also demonstrate the application of the convolution ISA approach to cholesterol biosynthesis; the model was applied to measurements made on MCF7 cells cultured in U-13C-glucose. In conclusion, we believe that convISA offers a convenient, flexible and transparent framework for metabolic modelling that will help facilitate the application of ISA to future experiments.",

To address these challenges, we have developed a cell-free system that harnesses ensembles of catalytic proteins prepared from crude lysates, or extracts, of cells to fuel highly active heterologous metabolic conversions. As a model pathway, we selected conversion of glucose to 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD), a medium level commodity chemical with many industrial applications. Specifically, we engineered a single strain of Escherichia coli to express three pathway enzymes necessary to make meso-2,3-BD (m2,3-BD). We then demonstrated that lysates from this strain, with addition of glucose and catalytic amounts of cofactors NAD+ and ATP, can produce m2,3-BD. Endogenous glycolytic enzymes convert glucose to pyruvate, the starting intermediate for m2,3-BD synthesis. Strikingly, with no strain optimization, we observed a maximal synthesis rate of m2,3-BD of 11.3±0.1 g/L/h with a theoretical yield of 71% (0.36 g m2,3-BD/g glucose) in batch reactions.

     "abstract": "In this study we combined experimentation with mathematical modeling to unravel the in vivo kinetic properties of the enzymes and transporters of the penicillin biosynthesis pathway in a high yielding Penicillium chrysogenum strain. The experiment consisted of a step response experiment with the side chain precursor phenyl acetic acid (PAA) in a glucose-limited chemostat. The metabolite data showed that in the absence of PAA all penicillin pathway enzymes were expressed, leading to the production of a significant amount of 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6APA) as end product. After the stepwise perturbation with PAA, the pathway produced PenG within seconds. From the extra- and intracellular metabolite measurements, hypotheses for the secretion mechanisms of penicillin pathway metabolites were derived. A dynamic model of the penicillin biosynthesis pathway was then constructed that included the formation and transport over the cytoplasmic membrane of pathway intermediates, PAA and the product penicillin-G (PenG). The model parameters and changes in the enzyme levels of the penicillin biosynthesis pathway under in vivo conditions were simultaneously estimated using experimental data obtained at three different timescales (seconds, minutes, hours). The model was applied to determine changes in the penicillin pathway enzymes in time, calculate fluxes and analyze the flux control of the pathway. This led to a reassessment of the in vivo behavior of the pathway enzymes and in particular Acyl-CoA:Isopenicillin N Acyltransferase (AT).",

The genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway for poly-3-hydroxybutyrate from Chlorogloeopsis fritschii PCC 9212 were introduced into Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, and the resulting strain was able to accumulate 2.77% of total cell dry weight as poly-3-hydroxybutyrate. When the ccmR gene was deleted in this strain, the yield of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate increased to 3.97% of total cell dry weight. A biosynthetic pathway for the production of 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA was also constructed and introduced into the poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-producing strain. The resulting strain was able to produce ~4.5% of total cell dry weight as poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate, in which 4-hydroxybutyrate accounted for ~12% of the co-polymer. These results demonstrate that poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate can be produced in cyanobacteria and confirm that succinic semialdehyde is an important TCA cycle metabolite in cyanobacteria.

     "abstract": "Clostridium thermocellum is an anaerobic, Gram-positive, thermophilic bacterium that has generated great interest due to its ability to ferment lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol. However, ethanol production is low due to the complex and poorly understood branched metabolism of C. thermocellum, and in some cases overflow metabolism as well. In this work, we developed a predictive stoichiometric metabolic model for C. thermocellum which incorporates the current state of understanding, with particular attention to cofactor specificity in the atypical glycolytic enzymes and the complex energy, redox, and fermentative pathways with the goal of aiding metabolic engineering efforts. We validated the model’s capability to encompass experimentally observed phenotypes for the parent strain and derived mutants designed for significant perturbation of redox and energy pathways. Metabolic flux distributions revealed significant alterations in key metabolic branch points (e.g., phosphoenol pyruvate, pyruvate, acetyl-CoA, and cofactor nodes) in engineered strains for channeling electron and carbon fluxes for enhanced ethanol synthesis, with the best performing strain doubling ethanol yield and titer compared to the parent strain. In silico predictions of a redox-imbalanced genotype incapable of growth were confirmed in vivo, and a mutant strain was used as a platform to probe redox bottlenecks in the central metabolism that hinder efficient ethanol production. The results highlight the robustness of the redox metabolism of C. thermocellum and the necessity of streamlined electron flux from reduced ferredoxin to NAD(P)H for high ethanol production. The model was further used to design a metabolic engineering strategy to phenotypically constrain C. thermocellum to achieve high ethanol yields while requiring minimal genetic manipulations. The model can be applied to design C. thermocellum as a platform microbe for consolidated bioprocessing to produce ethanol and other reduced metabolites.",

These cells can be assembled with exchangeable production modules in a plug-and-play fashion to build microbial cell factories for efficient combinatorial biosynthesis of novel molecules, requiring minimal iterative strain optimization steps. A modular cell is designed to be auxotrophic, containing core metabolic pathways that are necessary but insufficient to support cell growth and maintenance. To be functional, it must tightly couple with an exchangeable production module containing auxiliary metabolic pathways that not only complement cell growth but also enhance production of targeted molecules. We developed a MODCELL (modular cell) framework based on metabolic pathway analysis to implement the modular cell design principle. MODCELL identifies genetic modifications and requirements to construct modular cell candidates and their associated exchangeable production modules. By defining the degree of similarity and coupling metrics, MODCELL can evaluate which exchangeable production module(s) can be tightly coupled with a modular cell candidate. We first demonstrated how MODCELL works in a step-by-step manner for example metabolic networks, and then applied it to design modular Escherichia coli cells for efficient combinatorial biosynthesis of five alcohols (ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol and isobutanol) and five butyrate esters (ethyl butyrate, propyl butyrate, isopropyl butyrate, butyl butyrate and isobutyl butyrate) from pentose sugars (arabinose and xylose) and hexose sugars (glucose, mannose, and galactose) under anaerobic conditions. We identified three modular cells, MODCELL1, MODCELL2 and MODCELL3, that can couple well with Group 1 of modules (ethanol, isobutanol, butanol, ethyl butyrate, isobutyl butyrate, butyl butyrate), Group 2 (isopropanol, isopropyl butyrate), and Group 3 (propanol, isopropanol), respectively.

We demonstrate the use of the MuSIC framework in a case study where two major polymer precursors (1,3-propanediol and 3-hydroxypropionic acid) are produced from two biomass feedstocks (corn-based glucose and soy-based glycerol) through 66 proposed biosynthetic pathways in two host organisms (Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae).

Accordingly, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGD), succinyl-CoA synthetase (SUCLG), and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) were selected to be manipulated for strengthening the oxidative pathway, and the engineered strain T.G-K-S-S exhibited increased fumarate biosynthesis (1.81 g L−1). To further improve fumarate production, the oxidative route was optimized. First, three fusion proteins KGD2-SUCLG2, SUCLG2-SDH1 and KGD2-SDH1 were constructed, and KGD2-SUCLG2 led to improved fumarate production (4.24 g L−1). In addition, various strengths of KGD2-SUCLG2 and SDH1 expression cassettes were designed by combinations of promoter strengths and copy numbers, resulting in a large increase in fumarate production (from 4.24 g L−1 to 8.24 g L−1). Then, through determining intracellular amino acids and its related gene expression levels, argininosuccinate lyase in the urea cycle was identified as the key factor for restricting higher fumarate production. Correspondingly, after overexpression of it, the fumarate production was further increased to 9.96 g L−1. Next, two dicarboxylic acids transporters facilitated an improvement of fumarate production, and, as a result, the final strain T.G-KS(H)-S(M)–A-2 S reached fumarate titer of 15.76 g L−1. This strategy described here paves the way to the development of an efficient pathway for microbial production of fumarate.",

While yeast strains have been engineered to produce a variety of downstream BIAs including the opioids, these strains have relied on feeding an early BIA substrate. We describe the de novo synthesis of the major BIA branch point intermediate reticuline via norcoclaurine in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Modifications were introduced into yeast central metabolism to increase supply of the BIA precursor tyrosine, allowing us to achieve a 60-fold increase in production of the early benzylisoquinoline scaffold from fed dopamine with no supply of exogenous tyrosine. Yeast strains further engineered to express a mammalian tyrosine hydroxylase, four mammalian tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis and recycling enzymes, and a bacterial DOPA decarboxylase produced norcoclaurine de novo. We further increased production of early benzylisoquinoline scaffolds by 160-fold through introducing mutant tyrosine hydroxylase enzymes, an optimized plant norcoclaurine synthase variant, and optimizing culture conditions. Finally, we incorporated five additional plant enzymes – three methyltransferases, a cytochrome P450, and its reductase partner – to achieve de novo production of the key branch point molecule reticuline with a titer of 19.2 μg/L. These strains and reconstructed pathways will serve as a platform for the biosynthesis of diverse natural and novel BIAs.",

Comparing the underlying mechanism of this mutant to other previously engineered strains suggests that creating an imbalance between glycolysis and the TCA cycle can serve as a driving force for lipogenesis when combined with fatty acid catabolism overexpressions.

The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent glucose phosphotransferase system (ptsG) was disrupted to eliminate catabolite repression and allow simultaneous uptake of glucose and xylose. The native pathway for D-xylose catabolism in E. coli W3110 was blocked by deleting the xylose isomerase (xylA) and xylulose kinase (xylB) genes.

Instead, metabolic fluxes for each species in a co-culture are estimated directly from isotopic labeling of total biomass obtained using conventional mass spectrometry approaches such as GC–MS. In addition to determining metabolic fluxes, this approach estimates the relative population size of each species in a mixed culture and inter-species metabolite exchange. As such, it enables detailed studies of microbial communities including species dynamics and interactions between community members. The methodology is experimentally validated here using a co-culture of two E. coli knockout strains.

However, cyanobacteria do not possess pathways for synthesizing glycerol and converting glycerol to 3HP. Furthermore, the latter pathway requires coenzyme B12, or an oxygen sensitive, coenzyme B12-independent enzyme. These characteristics present major challenges for production of 3HP using cyanobacteria. To overcome such difficulties, we constructed two alternative pathways in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942: a malonyl-CoA dependent pathway and a β-alanine dependent pathway. Expression of the malonyl-CoA dependent pathway genes (malonyl-CoA reductase and malonate semialdehyde reductase) enabled S. elongatus to synthesize 3HP to a final titer of 665 mg/L. β-Alanine dependent pathway expressing S. elongatus produced 3HP to final titer of 186 mg/L.

A key obstacle to allocating scarce treatment resources is the ability to measure population blood micronutrient status inexpensively and quickly enough to identify those who most need treatment. This paper develops a metabolically engineered strain of Escherichia coli to produce different colored pigments (violacein, lycopene, and β-carotene) in response to different extracellular zinc levels, for eventual use in an inexpensive blood zinc diagnostic test. However, obtaining discrete color states in the carotenoid pathway required precise engineering of metabolism to prevent reaction at low zinc concentrations but allow complete reaction at higher concentrations, and all under the constraints of natural regulator limitations. Hence, the metabolic engineering challenge was not to improve titer, but to enable precise control of pathway state. A combination of gene dosage, post-transcriptional, and post-translational regulation was necessary to allow visible color change over physiologically relevant ranges representing a small fraction of the regulator’s dynamic response range, with further tuning possible by modulation of precursor availability. As metabolic engineering expands its applications and develops more complex systems, tight control of system components will likely become increasingly necessary, and the approach presented here can be generalized to other natural sensing systems for precise control of pathway state.",

Although selectable traits are limited, currently each trait only permits simultaneous introduction of a single DNA fragment. Complex pathway and strain construction however depends on rapid, combinatorial introduction of many genes that encode putative pathway candidates and homologs. To triple the utility of existing selection genes, we have developed divisible selection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, independent DNA fragments can be introduced and selected for simultaneously using a set of split hybrid transcription factors composed of parts from Escherichia coli LexA and Herpes simplex VP16 to regulate one single selectable phenotype of choice. Only when co-expressed, these split hybrid transcription factors promote transcription of a selection gene, causing tight selection of transformants containing all desired DNA fragments. Upon transformation, 94% of the selected colonies resulted strictly from transforming all three modules based on ARS/CEN plasmids. Similarly when used for chromosome integration, 95% of the transformants contained all three modules. The divisible selection system acts dominantly and thus expands selection gene utility from one to three without any genomic pre-modifications of the strain. We demonstrate the approach by introducing the fungal rubrofusarin polyketide pathway at a gene load of 11 kb distributed on three different plasmids, using a single selection trait and one yeast transformation step. By tripling the utility of existing selection genes, the employment of divisible selection improves flexibility and freedom in the strain engineering process.",

However, the mechanism of lipid overproduction in these organisms is incompletely understood, hindering the development of strategies for engineering superior biocatalysts for “single-cell oil” production. In particular, it is unclear which pathways are used to generate the large quantities of NADPH required for overproduction of the highly reduced fatty acid species. While early studies implicated malic enzyme as having a key role in production of lipogenic NADPH in oleaginous fungi, several recent reports have cast doubts as to whether malic enzyme may contribute to production of lipogenic NADPH in the model oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. To address this problem we have used 13C-Metabolic Flux Analysis to estimate the metabolic flux distributions during lipid accumulation in two Y. lipolytica strains; a control strain and a previously published engineered strain capable of producing lipids at roughly twice the yield. We observe a dramatic rearrangement of the metabolic flux distribution in the engineered strain which supports lipid overproduction. The NADPH-producing flux through the oxidative Pentose Phosphate Pathway is approximately doubled in the engineered strain in response to the roughly two-fold increase in fatty acid biosynthesis, while the flux through malic enzyme does not differ significantly between the two strains. Moreover, the estimated rate of NADPH production in the oxidative Pentose Phosphate Pathway is in good agreement with the estimated rate of NADPH consumption in fatty acid biosynthesis in both strains. These results suggest the oxidative Pentose Phosphate Pathway is the primary source of lipogenic NADPH in Y. lipolytica.",

We show that given biochemical functions can be entirely suppressed in vivo with camel antibodies (VHHs, nanobodies) that target active sites of cognate enzymes expressed in the cytoplasm. As a proof of principle, we raised VHHs against 2,5-dihydroxypyridine dioxygenase (NicX) of Pseudomonas putida, involved in nicotinic acid metabolism. Once fused to a thioredoxin domain, the corresponding nanobodies inhibited the enzyme both in Escherichia coli and in P. putida cells, which then accumulated the metabolic substrate of NicX. VHHs were further engineered to track the antigen in vivo by C-terminal fusion to a fluorescent protein. Conditional expression of the resulting VHHs allows simultaneously to track and target proteins of interest and enables the design of transient phenotypes without mutating the genetic complement of the bacteria under study.",

     "abstract": "Coordination between cell populations via prevailing metabolic cues has been noted as a promising approach to connect synthetic devices and drive phenotypic or product outcomes. However, there has been little progress in developing ‘controller cells’ to modulate metabolic cues and guide these systems. In this work, we developed ‘controller cells’ that manipulate the molecular connection between cells by modulating the bacterial signal molecule, autoinducer-2, that is secreted as a quorum sensing (QS) signal by many bacterial species. Specifically, we have engineered Escherichia coli to overexpress components responsible for autoinducer uptake (lsrACDB), phosphorylation (lsrK), and degradation (lsrFG), thereby attenuating cell–cell communication among populations. Further, we developed a simple mathematical model that recapitulates experimental data and characterizes the dynamic balance among the various uptake mechanisms. This study revealed two controller ‘knobs’ that serve to increase AI-2 uptake: overexpression of the AI-2 transporter, LsrACDB, which controls removal of extracellular AI-2, and overexpression of the AI-2 kinase, LsrK, which increases the net uptake rate by limiting secretion of AI-2 back into the extracellular environment. We find that the overexpression of lsrACDBFG results in an extraordinarily high AI-2 uptake rate that is capable of completely silencing QS-mediated gene expression among wild-type cells. We demonstrate utility by modulating naturally occurring processes of chemotaxis and biofilm formation. We envision that ‘controller cells’ that modulate bacterial behavior by manipulating molecular communication, will find use in a variety of applications, particularly those employing natural or synthetic bacterial consortia.",

However, in the engineered strains with enhanced precursor supply, the production of the target metabolite is often impeded by insufficient capacity of the heterologous terpenoid pathways, which limits further conversion of FPP. Here, we tried to assemble an unimpeded biosynthesis pathway by combining directed evolution and metabolic engineering in S. cerevisiae for lycopene-overproduction. First, the catalytic ability of phytoene syntheses from different sources was investigated based on lycopene accumulation. Particularly, the lycopene cyclase function of the bifunctional enzyme CrtYB from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous was inactivated by deletion of functional domain and directed evolution to obtain mutants with solely phytoene synthase function. Coexpression of the resulting CrtYB11M mutant along with the CrtE and CrtI genes from X. dendrorhous, and the tHMG1 gene from S. cerevisiae led to production of 4.47 mg/g DCW (Dry cell weight) of lycopene and 25.66 mg/g DCW of the by-product squalene. To further increase the FPP competitiveness of the lycopene synthesis pathway, we tried to enhance the catalytic performance of CrtE by directed evolution and created a series of pathway variants by varying the copy number of Crt genes. Finally, fed-batch fermentation was conducted for the diploid strain YXWPD-14 resulting in accumulation of 1.61 g/L (24.41 mg/g DCW) of lycopene, meanwhile, the by-production of squalene was reduced to below 1 mg/g DCW.",

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a current host for heterologous protein production and potential platform for production of nitrogen-containing chemicals, uptake and assimilation of ammonium requires 1 ATP per incorporated NH3. Urea assimilation by this yeast is more energy efficient but still requires 0.5 ATP per NH3 produced. To decrease ATP costs for nitrogen assimilation, the S. cerevisiae gene encoding ATP-dependent urease (DUR1,2) was replaced by a Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene encoding ATP-independent urease (ure2), along with its accessory genes ureD, ureF and ureG. Since S. pombe ure2 is a Ni2+-dependent enzyme and Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not express native Ni2+-dependent enzymes, the S. pombe high-affinity nickel-transporter gene (nic1) was also expressed. Expression of the S. pombe genes into dur1,2Δ S. cerevisiae yielded an in vitro ATP-independent urease activity of 0.44±0.01 µmol min−1 mg protein−1 and restored growth on urea as sole nitrogen source. Functional expression of the Nic1 transporter was essential for growth on urea at low Ni2+ concentrations. The maximum specific growth rates of the engineered strain on urea and ammonium were lower than those of a DUR1,2 reference strain. In glucose-limited chemostat cultures with urea as nitrogen source, the engineered strain exhibited an increased release of ammonia and reduced nitrogen content of the biomass. Our results indicate a new strategy for improving yeast-based production of nitrogen-containing chemicals and demonstrate that Ni2+-dependent enzymes can be functionally expressed in S. cerevisiae.",

     "abstract": "Enforcing obligate coupling of growth with synthesis of a desired product has become a key principle for metabolic engineering of microbial production strains. Various methods from stoichiometric and constraint-based modeling have been developed to calculate intervention strategies by which a given microorganism can only grow if it synthesizes a desired compound as a mandatory by-product. However, growth-coupled synthesis is not necessarily feasible for every compound of a metabolic network and no rigorous criterion is currently known to test feasibility of coupled product and biomass formation (before searching for suitable intervention strategies). In this work, we show which properties a network must fulfill such that strain designs guaranteeing coupled biomass and product synthesis can exist at all. In networks without flux bounds, coupling is feasible if and only if an elementary mode exists that leads to formation of both biomass and product. Setting flux boundaries leads to more complicated inhomogeneous problems. Making use of the concept of elementary (flux) vectors, a generalization of elementary modes, a criterion for feasibility can also be derived for this situation. We applied our criteria to a metabolic model of Escherichia coli and determined for each metabolite, whether its net production can be coupled with biomass synthesis and calculated the maximal (guaranteed) coupling yield. The somewhat surprising result is that, under aerobic conditions, coupling is indeed possible for each carbon metabolite of the central metabolism. This also holds true for most metabolites under anaerobic conditions but consideration of ATP maintenance requirements implies infeasibility of coupling for certain compounds. On the other hand, ATP maintenance may also increase the maximal coupling yield for some metabolites. Overall, our work provides important insights and novel tools for a central problem of computational strain design.",

Semi-synthetic derivatives of PI and PII have been approved for use in human medicine to treat a broad range of drug-resistant pathogens. In this study, we design and implement a combinatorial metabolic engineering strategy for improving PII production. First, an extra copy of the PII biosynthetic gene cluster, which was assembled using a modified Gibson assembly method for cloning large DNA fragments with high GC contents, was introduced into a high-producing strain S. pristinaespiralis HCCB10218. This duplication of the PII biosynthetic gene cluster resulted in a maximum increase in PII titer by 45%. Second, all seven cluster-situated regulatory genes (from papR1 to papR6 and spbR) were systematically manipulated. Higher PII titers were achieved by deleting either one of the two repressor genes papR3 or papR5 in combination with overexpression of both activator genes papR4 and papR6, and the resulting strains ∆papR3+R4R6 and ∆papR5+R4R6 showed maximum increases in PII production by 99% and 75%, respectively. A combination of the above two different approaches was employed. Integration of the assembled PII gene cluster (BAC-F1F15) into ∆papR5+R4R6 led to the highest PII titer improvement, which was approximately 1.5-fold higher than the parental strain. By adding the macroreticular resin, which can separate pristinamycin in situ and thereby lessen end-product feedback inhibition and toxic effects, PII titers of the final engineered strain ∆papR5+R4R6/BAC-F1F15 reached 1.13 and 1.16 g/L in the Erlenmeyer flask and 5-L bioreactor, respectively, with 5.13- and 5.26-fold improvements over the parental strain.

Through our previous rational metabolic engineering efforts, lipogenesis titers in Yarrowia lipolytica were significantly enhanced. However, the resulting strain still suffered from decreased biomass generation rates. Here, we employ a rapid evolutionary metabolic engineering approach linked with a floating cell enrichment process to improve lipogenesis rates, titers, and yields. Through this iterative process, we were able to ultimately improve yields from our prior strain by 55% to achieve production titers of 39.1 g/L with upwards of 76% of the theoretical maximum yield of conversation. Isolated cells were saturated with up to 87% lipid content. An average specific productivity of 0.56 g/L/h was achieved with a maximum instantaneous specific productivity of 0.89 g/L/h during the lipid production phase in fermentation. Genomic sequencing of the evolved strains revealed a link between a decrease/loss of function mutation of succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, uga2, suggesting the importance of gamma-aminobutyric acid assimilation in lipogenesis. This linkage was validated through gene deletion experiments. This work presents an improved host strain that can serve as a platform for efficient oleochemical production.",

Here we show that spermidine (SPD) functions as a chemical elicitor for enhanced tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae against major fermentation inhibitors. In addition, the feasibility of constructing an engineered S. cerevisiae strain capable of tolerating toxic levels of the major inhibitors without exogenous addition of SPD was explored. Specifically, we altered expression levels of the genes in the SPD biosynthetic pathway. Also, OAZ1 coding for ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) antizyme and TPO1 coding for the polyamine transport protein were disrupted to increase intracellular SPD levels through alleviation of feedback inhibition on ODC and prevention of SPD excretion, respectively. Especially, the strain with combination of OAZ1 and TPO1 double disruption and overexpression of SPE3 not only contained spermidine content of 1.1 mg SPD/g cell, which was 171% higher than that of the control strain, but also exhibited 60% and 33% shorter lag-phase period than that of the control strain under the medium containing furan derivatives and acetic acid, respectively. While we observed a positive correlation between intracellular SPD contents and tolerance phenotypes among the engineered strains accumulating different amounts of intracellular SPD, too much SPD accumulation is likely to cause metabolic burden. Therefore, genetic perturbations for intracellular SPD levels should be optimized in terms of metabolic burden and SPD contents to construct inhibitor tolerant yeast strains. We also found that the genes involved in purine biosynthesis and cell wall and chromatin stability were related to the enhanced tolerance phenotypes to furfural. The robust strains constructed in this study can be applied for producing chemicals and advanced biofuels from cellulosic hydrolysates.",

Although some microorganisms can convert sugars to oils, conversion yields and rates are typically low due primarily to allosteric inhibition of the lipid biosynthetic pathway by saturated fatty acids. By reverse engineering the mammalian cellular obese phenotypes, we identified the delta-9 stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) as a rate limiting step and target for the metabolic engineering of the lipid synthesis pathway in Yarrowia lipolytica. Simultaneous overexpression of SCD, Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), and Diacylglyceride acyl-transferase (DGA1) in Y. lipolytica yielded an engineered strain exhibiting highly desirable phenotypes of fast cell growth and lipid overproduction including high carbon to lipid conversion yield (84.7% of theoretical maximal yield), high lipid titers (~55 g/L), enhanced tolerance to glucose and cellulose-derived sugars. Moreover, the engineered strain featured a three-fold growth advantage over the wild type strain. As a result, a maximal lipid productivity of ~1 g/L/h is obtained during the stationary phase. Furthermore, we showed that the engineered yeast required cytoskeleton remodeling in eliciting the obesity phenotype. Altogether, our work describes the development of a microbial catalyst with the highest reported lipid yield, titer and productivity to date. This is an important step towards the development of an efficient and cost-effective process for biodiesel production from renewable resources.",

When cultured under atmospheric CO2 pressure, the strain expressing extra BicA transporters (BicA+ strain) grew almost twice as fast and accumulated almost twice as much biomass as the control strain. When enriched with 0.5% or 5% CO2, the BicA+ strain grew slower than the control but still showed a superior biomass production. Introducing a point mutation in the large C-terminal cytosolic domain of the inserted BicA, at a site implicated in allosteric regulation of transport activity, resulted in a strain (BicA+(T485G) strain) that exhibited pronounced cell aggregation and failed to grow at 5% CO2. However, the bicarbonate uptake capacity of the induced BicA+(T485G) was twice higher than for the wild-type strain. Metabolic analyses, including phenotyping by synchrotron-radiation Fourier transform Infrared spectromicroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and lectin staining, suggest that the excess assimilated carbon in BicA+ and BicA+(T485G) cells was directed into production of saccharide-rich exopolymeric substances. We propose that the increased capacity for CO2 uptake in the BicA+ strain can be capitalized on by re-directing carbon flux from exopolymeric substances to other end products such as fuels or high-value chemicals.",

We have rationally engineered a synthetic version of the Entner–Doudoroff pathway from Zymomonas mobilis that increased the NADPH regeneration rate in Escherichia coli MG1655 by 25-fold. To do this, we combined systematic design rules, biophysical models, and computational optimization to design synthetic bacterial operons expressing the 5-enzyme pathway, while eliminating undesired genetic elements for maximum expression control. NADPH regeneration rates from genome-integrated pathways were estimated using a NADPH-binding fluorescent reporter and by the productivity of a NADPH-dependent terpenoid biosynthesis pathway. We designed and constructed improved pathway variants by employing the RBS Library Calculator to efficiently search the 5-dimensional enzyme expression space and by performing 40 cycles of MAGE for site-directed genome mutagenesis. 624 pathway variants were screened using a NADPH-dependent blue fluorescent protein, and 22 were further characterized to determine the relationship between enzyme expression levels and NADPH regeneration rates. The best variant exhibited 25-fold higher normalized mBFP levels when compared to wild-type strain.

However, the concentrations of Rh2 and Rg3 are extremely low in the bioactive constituents (triterpene saponins) of ginseng. Despite the available heterologous biosynthesis of their aglycone (protopanaxadiol, PPD) in yeast, production of Rh2 and Rg3 by a synthetic biology approach was hindered by the absence of bioparts to glucosylate the C3 hydroxyl of PPD. In this study, two UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) were cloned and identified from Panax ginseng. UGTPg45 selectively transfers a glucose moiety to the C3 hydroxyl of PPD and its ginsenosides. UGTPg29 selectively transfers a glucose moiety to the C3 glucose of Rh2 to form a 1–2-glycosidic bond. Based on the two UGTs and a yeast chassis to produce PPD, yeast cell factories were built to produce Rh2 and/or Rg3 from glucose. The turnover number (kcat) of UGTPg29 was more than 2500-fold that of UGTPg45, which might explain the higher Rg3 yield than that of Rh2 in the yeast cell factories. Building yeast cell factories to produce Rh2 or Rg3 from simple sugars by microbial fermentation provides an alternative approach to replace the traditional method of extracting ginsenosides from Panax plants.",

Chemical production directly from photosynthesis is a nascent technology, with great promise for capture of CO2 using sunlight. To improve low yields, it has been proposed that photosynthetic capacity can be increased by a relaxation of bottlenecks inherent to growth. The limits of carbon partitioning away from growth within the cell and the effect of partitioning on carbon fixation are not well known. Here we show that expressing genes in a pathway between carbon fixation and pyruvate increases partitioning to 2,3-butanediol (23BD) and leads to a 1.8-fold increase in total carbon yield in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. Specific 2,3-butanediol production increases 2.4-fold. As partitioning increases beyond 30%, it leads to a steep decline in total carbon yield.

Also, medium even-chain alkanes (C12, C14) were obtained by substitution of AHR to aldehyde decarbonylase (AD).

While it is generally accepted that membrane damage is the main mechanism of fatty acid toxicity, previous metabolic engineering efforts that increased membrane integrity did not enable increased carboxylic acid production. Here we used an evolutionary approach to improve tolerance to exogenous octanoic acid, with the goal of learning design strategies from this evolved strain. This evolution of an Escherichia coli MG1655 derivative at neutral pH in minimal media produced a strain with increased tolerance not only to octanoic acid, but also to hexanoic acid, decanoic acid, n-butanol and isobutanol. This evolved strain also produced carboxylic acids at a 5-fold higher titer than its parent strain when expressing the Anaerococcus tetradius thioesterase. While it has been previously suggested that intracellular acidification may contribute to carboxylic acid toxicity, we saw no evidence that the evolved strain has increased resistance to this acidification. Characterization of the evolved strain membrane showed that it had significantly altered membrane polarization (fluidity), integrity (leakage) and composition relative to its parent. The changes in membrane composition included a significant increase in average lipid length in a variety of growth conditions, including 30 °C, 42 °C, carboxylic acid challenge and ethanol challenge. The evolved strain has a more dynamic membrane composition, showing both a larger number of significant changes and larger fold changes in the relative abundance of membrane lipids.

     "abstract": "Until now, pyridoxine (PN), the most commonly supplemented B6 vitamer for animals and humans, is chemically synthesized for commercial purposes. Thus, the development of a microbial fermentation process is of great interest for the biotech industry. Recently, we constructed a Bacillus subtilis strain that formed significant amounts of PN via a non-native deoxyxylulose 5′-phosphate-(DXP)-dependent vitamin B6 pathway. Here we report the optimization of the condensing reaction of this pathway that consists of the 4-hydroxy-l-threonine-phosphate dehydrogenase PdxA, the pyridoxine 5′-phosphate synthase PdxJ and the native DXP synthase, Dxs. To allow feeding of high amounts of 4-hydroxy-threonine (4-HO-Thr) that can be converted to PN by B. subtilis overexpressing PdxA and PdxJ, we first adapted the bacteria to tolerate the antimetabolite 4-HO-Thr. The adapted bacteria produced 28–34 mg/l PN from 4-HO-Thr while the wild-type parent produced only 12 mg/l PN. Moreover, by expressing different pdxA and pdxJ alleles in the adapted strain we identified a better combination of PdxA and PdxJ enzymes than reported previously, and the resulting strain produced 65 mg/l PN. To further enhance productivity mutants were isolated that efficiently take up and convert deoxyxylulose (DX) to DXP, which is incorporated into PN. Although these mutants were very efficient to convert low amount of exogenous DX, at higher DX levels they performed only slightly better. The present study uncovered several enzymes with promiscuous activity and it revealed that host metabolic pathways compete with the heterologous pathway for 4-HO-Thr. Moreover, the study revealed that the B. subtilis genome is quite flexible with respect to adaptive mutations, a property, which is very important for strain engineering.",

The CoQ10 content was enhanced after co-overexpression of UbiE and UbiG, however, accompanied by the accumulation of the intermediate 10P-MMBQ. UbiH was then co-overexpressed to pull the metabolic flux towards downstream, resulting in an elevated CoQ10 productivity and decreased biomass. On the other hand, the expression levels of UbiE and UbiG were tuned to eliminate the intermediate accumulation, however at the sacrifice of productivity. To alleviate the detrimental effect on either productivity or cell growth, we tried to fuse UbiG with UbiE and localize them onto the membrane to elevate intermediate conversion. By fusing UbiE and UbiG to pufX, CoQ10 was accumulated to 108.51±2.76 mg/L with a biomass of 12.2±0.9 g/L.

However, intracellular malonyl-CoA is usually maintained at low levels, which poses great challenges to efficient microbial production of malonyl-CoA derived molecules. Inactivation of the malonyl-CoA consumption pathway to increase its intracellular availability is not applicable, since it is usually lethal to microorganisms. In this work, we employ synthetic antisense RNAs (asRNAs) to conditionally down-regulate fatty acid biosynthesis and achieve malonyl-CoA enrichment in Escherichia coli. The optimized asRNA constructs with a loop-stem structure exhibit high interference efficiency up to 80%, leading to a 4.5-fold increase in intracellular malonyl-CoA concentration when fabD gene expression is inhibited. Strikingly, this strategy allows the improved production of natural products 4-hydroxycoumarin, resveratrol, and naringenin by 2.53-, 1.70-, and 1.53-fold in E. coli, respectively. In addition, down-regulation of other fab genes including fabH, fabB, and fabF also leads to remarkable increases in 4-hydroxycoumarin production. This study demonstrates a novel strategy to enhance intracellular malonyl-CoA and indicates the effectiveness of asRNA as a powerful tool for use in metabolic engineering.",

As its low toxicity to microbes, 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD), a fuel and platform bio-chemical, could be a promising alternative for biofuel production from renewable bioresources. In addition, no bacterial strains have been reported to produce enantiopure 2,3-BD using lignocellulosic hydrolysates. In this study, Enterobacter cloacae strain SDM was systematically and metabolically engineered to construct an efficient biocatalyst for production of the fuel and enantiopure bio-chemical—(2R,3R)-2,3-BD. First, the various (2R,3R)-2,3-BD dehydrogenase encoding genes were expressed in a meso-2,3-BD dehydrogenase encoding gene disrupted E. cloacae strain under native promoter Pb of the 2,3-BD biosynthetic gene cluster of E. cloacae. Then, carbon catabolite repression was eliminated via inactivation of the glucose transporter encoding gene ptsG and overexpression of a galactose permease encoding gene galP. The resultant strain could utilize glucose and xylose simultaneously. To improve the efficiency of (2R,3R)-2,3-BD production, the byproduct-producing genes (ldh and frdA) were knocked out, thereby enhancing the yield of (2R,3R)-2,3-BD by 16.5% in 500-mL Erlenmeyer flasks. By using fed-batch fermentation in a 5-L bioreactor, 152.0 g/L (2R,3R)-2,3-BD (purity>97.5%) was produced within 44 h with a specific productivity of 3.5 g/[L h] and a yield of 97.7% from a mixture of glucose and xylose, two major carbohydrate components in lignocellulosic hydrolysates. In addition, when a lignocellulosic hydrolysate was used as the substrate, 119.4 g/L (2R,3R)-2,3-BD (purity>96.0%) was produced within 51 h with a productivity of 2.3 g/[L h] and a yield of 95.0%. These results show that the highest records have been acquired for enantiopure (2R,3R)-2,3-BD production by a native or engineered strain from biomass-derived sugars.

Fatty acids are attractive biomolecules due to the flexibility of their iterative biosynthetic pathway, high energy content, and suitability for conversion into other secondary chemicals. Free fatty acids (FFAs) that can be secreted from the cell are particularly appealing due to their lower harvest costs and straightforward conversion into a broad range of biofuel and biochemical products. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered to overproduce extracellular FFAs by targeting three native intracellular processes. β-oxidation was disrupted by gene knockouts in FAA2, PXA1 and POX1, increasing intracellular fatty acids levels up to 55%. Disruptions in the acyl-CoA synthetase genes FAA1, FAA4 and FAT1 allowed the extracellular detection of free fatty acids up to 490 mg/L. Combining these two disrupted pathways, a sextuple mutant (Δfaa1 Δfaa4 Δfat1 Δfaa2 Δpxa1 Δpox1) was able to produce 1.3 g/L extracellular free fatty acids. Further diversion of carbon flux into neutral lipid droplet formation was investigated by the overexpression of DGA1 or ARE1 and by the co-overexpression of a compatible lipase, TGL1, TGL3 or TGL5.

This computational study asks whether robust performance can be achieved by adopting robustness-enhancing mechanisms from naturally evolved organisms–in particular, redundancy. Our study shows that redundancy, typically perceived as a ubiquitous robustness-enhancing strategy in nature, can either improve or undermine robustness depending on the magnitude of the perturbations. We also show that the optimal number of redundant pathways used can be predicted for a given perturbation size.",

Here, we present and demonstrate a computational tool (principal component analysis of proteomics, PCAP) that uses quantitative targeted proteomics data to guide metabolic engineering and achieve higher production of target molecules from heterologous pathways. The method is based on the application of principal component analysis to a collection of proteomics and target molecule production data to pinpoint specific enzymes that need to have their expression level adjusted to maximize production. We illustrated the method on the heterologous mevalonate pathway in Escherichia coli that produces a wide range of isoprenoids and requires balanced pathway gene expression for high yields and titers. PCAP-guided engineering resulted in over a 40% improvement in the production of two valuable terpenes. PCAP could potentially be productively applied to other heterologous pathways as well.",

The strategy takes advantage of genome-scale random mutagenesis for generation of genetic diversity and a reporter-guided selection system for the identification of the desired target-activated mutants. It was first validated in the re-activation of jadomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230, where high efficiency of activation was achieved.

A self-cleaving ribozyme glmS, found in gram-positive bacteria, cleaves its own transcript in response to the intracellular glucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcN6P) concentration. The glmS ribozyme was integrated into the 3′-untranslated region of FCY1, which encodes cytosine deaminase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to construct a suicide riboswitch for evolutionary engineering. Growth of the strain harboring the suicide riboswitch was hampered by the addition of fluorocytosine, and was recovered as metabolite level increased. By using this riboswitch, we isolated a N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) producer strain by screening an efficient glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase (Gfa1p) and haloacid dehalogenase-like phosphatases (HAD phosphatases) originated from Escherichia coli. The suicide riboswitch was also applied to different metabolite by using artificial allosteric ribozyme.

     "abstract": "The use of parallel labeling experiments for 13C metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) has emerged in recent years as the new gold standard in fluxomics. The methodology has been termed COMPLETE-MFA, short for complementary parallel labeling experiments technique for metabolic flux analysis. In this contribution, we have tested the limits of COMPLETE-MFA by demonstrating integrated analysis of 14 parallel labeling experiments with Escherichia coli. An effort on such a massive scale has never been attempted before. In addition to several widely used isotopic tracers such as [1,2-13C]glucose and mixtures of [1-13C]glucose and [U-13C]glucose, four novel tracers were applied in this study: [2,3-13C]glucose, [4,5,6-13C]glucose, [2,3,4,5,6-13C]glucose and a mixture of [1-13C]glucose and [4,5,6-13C]glucose. This allowed us for the first time to compare the performance of a large number of isotopic tracers. Overall, there was no single best tracer for the entire E. coli metabolic network model. Tracers that produced well-resolved fluxes in the upper part of metabolism (glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways) showed poor performance for fluxes in the lower part of metabolism (TCA cycle and anaplerotic reactions), and vice versa. The best tracer for upper metabolism was 80% [1-13C]glucose+20% [U-13C]glucose, while [4,5,6-13C]glucose and [5-13C]glucose both produced optimal flux resolution in the lower part of metabolism. COMPLETE-MFA improved both flux precision and flux observability, i.e. more independent fluxes were resolved with smaller confidence intervals, especially exchange fluxes. Overall, this study demonstrates that COMPLETE-MFA is a powerful approach for improving flux measurements and that this methodology should be considered in future studies that require very high flux resolution.",

     "abstract": "A novel strategy to finely control a large metabolic flux by using a “metabolic transistor” approach was established. In this approach a small change in the level or availability of an essential component for the process is controlled by adding a competitive reaction that affects a precursor or an intermediate in its biosynthetic pathway. The change of the basal level of the essential component, considered as a base current in a transistor, has a large effect on the flux through the major pathway. In this way, the fine-tuning of a large flux can be accomplished. The “metabolic transistor” strategy was applied to control electron transfer chain function by manipulation of the quinone synthesis pathway in Escherichia coli. The achievement of a theoretical yield of lactate production under aerobic conditions via this strategy upon manipulation of the biosynthetic pathway of the key participant, ubiquinone-8 (Q8), in an E. coli strain provides an in vivo, genetically tunable means to control the activity of the electron transfer chain and manipulate the production of reduced products while limiting consumption of oxygen to a defined amount.",

However, utilization of xylose, the predominant pentose present in lignocellulosic feedstocks, by this anaerobe is limited by CCR (Carbon Catabolite Repression) that is mediated by the catabolite control protein A (CcpA). Here, we reported a novel engineering strategy based on CcpA molecular modulation to overcome the defect. Through CcpA mutagenesis and screening, an amino acid residue, valine 302, was shown to be essential for CcpA-dependent CCR in C. acetobutylicum. When this residue was replaced by asparagine (V302N mutation), CCR could be alleviated and a greatly improved xylose utilization was realized. Transcriptional and DNA binding analysis was then used to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. Furthermore, the sol genes (ctfA, ctfB and adhE1) were overexpressed, upon the V302N mutation, to accelerate sugar consumption and solvents formation. The resulting strain (824ccpA-V302N-sol) was capable of using over 90% of the total xylose within 72 h when fermenting a mixture of glucose and xylose (30 g/L glucose and 15 g/L xylose), which was much higher than that (30%) of the control strain 824ccpA-ccpA(C).

We used controlled, steady-state cultures (chemostats) of a genetically stable strain to determine growth-independent metabolic flux regulation. We measured flux and steady-state intracellular metabolite concentrations across different dilution rates (0.05, 0.15, 0.3 h−1), limitations (glucose, gluconate and nitrogen), and operon copy counts of the PHB pathway (0, 6, 17, and 29). As PHB flux increases, specific substrate consumption and lactate secretion increase while formate and acetate secretion decreases in N-limited, glucose-fed conditions.To understand the regulatory mechanisms that resulted in these macroscopic changes, we used a flux balance analysis model to analyze intracellular redox conditions. Our model shows that under N-limited conditions, synthesis of PHB creates excess reducing equivalents. Cells, under these conditions, secrete more reduced metabolites in order to recycle reducing equivalents. By switching to a more oxidized substrate (gluconate) that decreased excess reducing equivalents, PHB flux yield increased 1.6 fold compared to glucose-fed fermentations. High flux of PHB (~1.2 mmol/g DCW h) was maintained under these steady-state, oxidized conditions. These results imply redox imbalance is a driving force in industrial production of PHB, and substrates that are more oxidized than glucose can increase productivity.",

We determined that the most promising approach allowing the utilization of methanol was the implementation of NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenase and the establishment of the ribulose monophosphate cycle by expressing the genes for hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps) and 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase (Phi). To test for the best-performing enzymes in the heterologous host, a number of enzyme candidates from different donor organisms were selected and systematically analyzed for their in vitro and in vivo activities in E. coli. Among these, Mdh2, Hps and Phi originating from Bacillus methanolicus were found to be the most effective. Labeling experiments using 13C methanol with E. coli producing these enzymes showed up to 40% incorporation of methanol into central metabolites. The presence of the endogenous glutathione-dependent formaldehyde oxidation pathway of E. coli did not adversely affect the methanol conversion rate.

A redesigned β-oxidation reversal facilitated the production of medium chain carboxylic acids, which were converted to ω-hydroxyacids and dicarboxylic acids by the action of an engineered ω-oxidation pathway. The selection of a key thiolase (bktB) and thioesterase (ydiI) in combination with previously established core β-oxidation reversal enzymes, as well as the development of chromosomal expression systems for the independent control of pathway enzymes, enabled the generation of C6–C10 carboxylic acids and provided a platform for vector based independent expression of ω-functionalization enzymes. Using this approach, the expression of the Pseudomonas putida alkane monooxygenase system, encoded by alkBGT, in combination with all β-oxidation reversal enzymes resulted in the production of 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid, 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid, and 10-hydroxydecanoic acid. Following identification and characterization of potential alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases, chnD and chnE from Acinetobacter sp. strain SE19 were expressed in conjunction with alkBGT to demonstrate the synthesis of the C6–C10 dicarboxylic acids, adipic acid, suberic acid, and sebacic acid. The potential of a β-oxidation cycle with ω-oxidation termination pathways was further demonstrated through the production of greater than 0.8 g/L C6–C10 ω-hydroxyacids or about 0.5 g/L dicarboxylic acids of the same chain lengths from glycerol (an unrelated carbon source) using minimal media.",

     "abstract": "Lignin represents an untapped feedstock for the production of fuels and chemicals, but its intrinsic heterogeneity makes lignin valorization a significant challenge. In nature, many aerobic organisms degrade lignin-derived aromatic molecules through conserved central intermediates including catechol and protocatechuate. Harnessing this microbial approach offers potential for lignin upgrading in modern biorefineries, but significant technical development is needed to achieve this end. Catechol and protocatechuate are subjected to aromatic ring cleavage by dioxygenase enzymes that, depending on the position, ortho or meta relative to adjacent hydroxyl groups, result in different products that are metabolized through parallel pathways for entry into the TCA cycle. These degradation pathways differ in the combination of succinate, acetyl-CoA, and pyruvate produced, the reducing equivalents regenerated, and the amount of carbon emitted as CO2—factors that will ultimately impact the yield of the targeted product. As shown here, the ring-cleavage pathways can be interchanged with one another, and such substitutions have a predictable and substantial impact on product yield. We demonstrate that replacement of the catechol ortho degradation pathway endogenous to Pseudomonas putida KT2440 with an exogenous meta-cleavage pathway from P. putida mt-2 increases yields of pyruvate produced from aromatic molecules in engineered strains. Even more dramatically, replacing the endogenous protocatechuate ortho pathway with a meta-cleavage pathway from Sphingobium sp. SYK-6 results in a nearly five-fold increase in pyruvate production. We further demonstrate the aerobic conversion of pyruvate to l-lactate with a yield of 41.1±2.6% (wt/wt). Overall, this study illustrates how aromatic degradation pathways can be tuned to optimize the yield of a desired product in biological lignin upgrading.",

This study established an improved artificial pathway for the biosynthesis of P(3HB-co-3HHx) with high 3HHx composition from structurally unrelated fructose in Ralstonia eutropha. Depression of (R)-specific reduction of acetoacetyl-CoA by the deletion of phaB1 was an effective modification for formation of the C6–monomer unit from fructose driven by crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase (Ccr). Co-overexpression of phaJ4a, which encodes medium-chain-length (R)-enoyl-CoA hydratase, with ccr promoted the incorporation of both 3HB and 3HHx units. Further introduction of emdMm, a synthetic gene encoding ethylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase derived from mouse, was remarkably effective for P(3HB-co-3HHx) biosynthesis, probably by converting ethylmalonyl-CoA generated by the reductive carboxylase activity of Ccr back into butyryl-CoA. A high cellular content of P(3HB-co-3HHx) composed of 22 mol% 3HHx could be produced from fructose by the engineered strain of R. eutropha with ΔphaB1 genotype expressing ccr, phaJ4a, and emd.",

Co-production of value-added products is a possible way to improve the economics of biobutanol production. Here, we present metabolic engineering strategies to substitute the major by-product acetone for a value-added product acetoin during butanol fermentation. By overexpressing the α-acetolactate decarboxylase gene alsD in Clostridium acetobutylicum B3, the acetoin yield was markedly increased while acetone formation was reduced. Subsequent disruption of adc gene effectively abolished acetone formation and further increased acetoin yield. After optimization of fermentation conditions, the alsD-overexpressing adc mutant generated butanol (13.8 g/L), acetoin (4.3 g/L), and ethanol (3.9 g/L), but no acetone. Thus, acetone was completely substituted for acetoin, and both mass yield and product value were improved.

Here, cells were grown in parallel cultures with [1-13C]glucose and [U-13C]glucose as tracers and 13C-MFA was used to quantify intracellular metabolic fluxes. Several metabolic network models were compared: an initial model based on current knowledge, and extended network models that included additional reactions that improved the fits of experimental data. While the initial network model did not produce a statistically acceptable fit of 13C-labeling data, an extended network model with five additional reactions was able to fit all data with 292 redundant measurements. The model was subsequently trimmed to produce a minimal network model of C. acetobutylicum for 13C-MFA, which could still reproduce all of the experimental data. The flux results provided valuable new insights into the metabolism of C. acetobutylicum. First, we found that TCA cycle was effectively incomplete, as there was no measurable flux between α-ketoglutarate and succinyl-CoA, succinate and fumarate, and malate and oxaloacetate. Second, an active pathway was identified from pyruvate to fumarate via aspartate. Third, we found that isoleucine was produced exclusively through the citramalate synthase pathway in C. acetobutylicum and that CAC3174 was likely responsible for citramalate synthase activity. These model predictions were confirmed in several follow-up tracer experiments. The validated metabolic network model established in this study can be used in future investigations for unbiased 13C-flux measurements in C. acetobutylicum.",

Genetic engineering has been used to improve the ability of Yarrowia lipolytica, an oleaginous yeast, to produce lipids using glucose-based media. However, few studies have examined lipid accumulation by Y. lipolytica׳s ability to utilize other hexose sugars, and as of yet, the rate-limiting steps in this process are unidentified. In this study, we investigated the de novo accumulation of lipids by Y. lipolytica when grown in glucose, fructose, and sucrose. Three Y. lipolytica wild-type (WT) strains of varied origin differed significantly in their lipid production, growth, and fructose utilization. Hexokinase (ylHXK1p) activity partially explained these differences. Overexpression of the ylHXK1 gene led to increased hexokinase activity (6.5–12 times higher) in the mutants versus the WT strains; a pronounced reduction in cell filamentation in mutants grown in fructose-based media; and improved biomass production, particularly in the mutant whose parent had shown the lowest growth capacity in fructose (French strain W29). All mutants showed improved lipid yield and production when grown on fructose, although the effect was strain dependent (23–55% improvement). Finally, we overexpressed ylHXK1 in a highly modified strain of Y. lipolytica W29 engineered to optimize oil production. This modification was combined with Saccharomyces cerevisiae invertase gene expression to evaluate the resulting mutant׳s ability to produce lipids using cheap industrial substrates, namely sucrose (a major component of molasses). Sucrose turned out to be a better substrate than either of its building blocks, glucose or fructose. Over its 96 h of growth in the bioreactors, this highly modified strain produced 9.15 g L−1 of lipids, yielding 0.262 g g−1 of biomass.",

Phytoremediation is an efficient technology for cleaning up pollutants. However, unlike microorganisms, plants lack the catabolic pathway for complete degradation of these dangerous groups of compounds. One way to enhance the potential of plants for remediation of these compounds is by transferring genes involved in xenobiotic degradation from microbes to plants. In this paper, four genes, namely nidA and nidB (encoding the large and small subunits of naphthalene dioxygenase of Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1) as well as NahAa and NahAb (encoding flavoprotein reductase and ferredoxin of the electron-transport chain of the Pseudomonas putida G7 naphthalene dioxygenase system), were transferred and ectopically expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the heterozygous naphthalene dioxygenase system exhibited enhanced tolerance toward 2–4 rings PAHs. Transgenic plants assimilated PAHs from the culture media faster and accumulated less in vivo than wild-type plants. Furthermore, examination of metabolic intermediates by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry revealed that the naphthalene metabolic pathway in transgenic plants mainly involves the dioxygenase pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that grafting the naphthalene dioxygenase complex into plants is a possible strategy to breed PAH-tolerant plants to efficiently degrade PAHs in the environment.",

This work addresses a serious limitation that must be overcome in order to produce renewable biodiesel and oleochemicals that perform as well as their petroleum-based counterparts.",

In this work, a de novo NADPH generation pathway is proposed by altering the coenzyme specificity of a native NAD-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) to NADP, which consequently has the potential to produce additional NADPH in the glycolytic pathway. Specifically, the coenzyme specificity of GAPDH of Corynebacterium glutamicum is systematically manipulated by rational protein design and the effect of the manipulation for cellular metabolism and lysine production is evaluated. By a combinatorial modification of four key residues within the coenzyme binding sites, different GAPDH mutants with varied coenzyme specificity were constructed. While increasing the catalytic efficiency of GAPDH towards NADP enhanced lysine production in all of the tested mutants, the most significant improvement of lysine production (~60%) was achieved with the mutant showing similar preference towards both NAD and NADP. Metabolic flux analysis with 13C isotope studies confirmed that there was no significant change of flux towards the pentose phosphate pathway and the increased lysine yield was mainly attributed to the NADPH generated by the mutated GAPDH. The present study highlights the importance of protein engineering as a key strategy in de novo pathway design and overproduction of desired products.",

While microorganisms and plants are capable of synthesizing vitamin B6, other organisms have to ingest it. The vitamer pyridoxine, which is used as a dietary supplement for animals and humans is commercially produced by chemical processes. The development of potentially more cost-effective and more sustainable fermentation processes for pyridoxine production is of interest for the biotech industry. We describe the generation and characterization of a Bacillus subtilis pyridoxine production strain overexpressing five genes of a non-native deoxyxylulose 5′-phosphate-dependent vitamin B6 pathway. The genes, derived from Escherichia coli and Sinorhizobium meliloti, were assembled to two expression cassettes and introduced into the B. subtilis chromosome. in vivo complementation assays revealed that the enzymes of this pathway were functionally expressed and active. The resulting strain produced 14 mg/l pyridoxine in a small-scale production assay. By optimizing the growth conditions and co-feeding of 4-hydroxy-threonine and deoxyxylulose the productivity was increased to 54 mg/l.

     "abstract": "In contrast to stoichiometric-based models, the development of large-scale kinetic models of metabolism has been hindered by the challenge of identifying kinetic parameter values and kinetic rate laws applicable to a wide range of environmental and/or genetic perturbations. The recently introduced ensemble modeling (EM) procedure provides a promising remedy to address these challenges by decomposing metabolic reactions into elementary reaction steps and incorporating all phenotypic observations, upon perturbation, in its model parameterization scheme. Here, we present a kinetic model of Escherichia coli core metabolism that satisfies the fluxomic data for wild-type and seven mutant strains by making use of the EM concepts. This model encompasses 138 reactions, 93 metabolites and 60 substrate-level regulatory interactions accounting for glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, major pyruvate metabolism, anaplerotic reactions and a number of reactions in other parts of the metabolism. Parameterization is performed using a formal optimization approach that minimizes the discrepancies between model predictions and flux measurements. The predicted fluxes by the model are within the uncertainty range of experimental flux data for 78% of the reactions (with measured fluxes) for both the wild-type and seven mutant strains. The remaining flux predictions are mostly within three standard deviations of reported ranges. Converting the EM-based parameters into a Michaelis–Menten equivalent formalism revealed that 35% of Km and 77% of kcat parameters are within uncertainty range of the literature-reported values. The predicted metabolite concentrations by the model are also within uncertainty ranges of metabolomic data for 68% of the metabolites. A leave-one-out cross-validation test to evaluate the flux prediction performance of the model showed that metabolic fluxes for the mutants located in the proximity of mutations used for training the model can be predicted more accurately. The constructed model and the parameterization procedure presented in this study pave the way for the construction of larger-scale kinetic models with more narrowly distributed parameter values as new metabolomic/fluxomic data sets are becoming available for E. coli and other organisms.",

Perturbations in expression levels may lead to system failure due to the disappearance of a stable steady state. Increasing evidence has suggested that biological networks have evolved such that they are intrinsically robust in their network structure. In this article, we presented Ensemble Modeling for Robustness Analysis (EMRA), which combines a continuation method with the Ensemble Modeling approach, for investigating the robustness issue of non-native pathways. EMRA investigates a large ensemble of reference models with different parameters, and determines the effects of parameter drifting until a bifurcation point, beyond which a stable steady state disappears and system failure occurs. A pathway is considered to have high bifurcational robustness if the probability of system failure is low in the ensemble. To demonstrate the utility of EMRA, we investigate the bifurcational robustness of two synthetic central metabolic pathways that achieve carbon conservation: non-oxidative glycolysis and reverse glyoxylate cycle. With EMRA, we determined the probability of system failure of each design and demonstrated that alternative designs of these pathways indeed display varying degrees of bifurcational robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrated that target selection for flux improvement should consider the trade-offs between robustness and performance.",

Expression of Bcl-2Δ reduced lactate accumulation by redirecting the fate of intracellular pyruvate toward mitochondrial oxidation during the lactate-producing phase, and it significantly increased lactate re-uptake during the lactate-consuming phase. This flux redistribution was associated with significant increases in biomass yield, peak viable cell density (VCD), and integrated VCD. Additionally, Bcl-2∆ expression was associated with significant increases in isocitrate dehydrogenase and NADH oxidase activities, both rate-controlling mitochondrial enzymes.

Herein, we report the production of a novel bio-nylon, PA5.10 through an integration of biological and chemical approaches. First, systems metabolic engineering of Corynebacterium glutamicum was used to create an effective microbial cell factory for the production of diaminopentane as the polymer building block. In this way, a hyper-producer, with a high diaminopentane yield of 41% in shake flask culture, was generated. Subsequent fed-batch production of C. glutamicum DAP-16 allowed a molar yield of 50%, a productivity of 2.2 g L−1 h−1, and a final titer of 88 g L−1. The streamlined producer accumulated diaminopentane without generating any by-products. Solvent extraction from alkalized broth and two-step distillation provided highly pure diaminopentane (99.8%), which was then directly accessible for poly-condensation. Chemical polymerization with sebacic acid, a ten-carbon dicarboxylic acid derived from castor plant oil, yielded the bio-nylon, PA5.10. In pure form and reinforced with glass fibers, the novel 100% bio-polyamide achieved an excellent melting temperature and the mechanical strength of the well-established petrochemical polymers, PA6 and PA6.6. It even outperformed the oil-based products in terms of having a 6% lower density. It thus holds high promise for applications in energy-friendly transportation. The demonstration of a novel route for generation of bio-based nylon from renewable sources opens the way to production of sustainable bio-polymers with enhanced material properties and represents a milestone in industrial production.",

     "abstract": "Processes for the biotechnological production of kerosene and diesel blendstocks are often economically unattractive due to low yields and product titers. Recently, Clostridium acetobutylicum fermentation products acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) were shown to serve as precursors for catalytic upgrading to higher chain-length molecules that can be used as fuel substitutes. To produce suitable kerosene and diesel blendstocks, the butanol:acetone ratio of fermentation products needs to be increased to 2–2.5:1, while ethanol production is minimized. Here we show that the overexpression of selected proteins changes the ratio of ABE products relative to the wild type ATCC 824 strain. Overexpression of the native alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase (AAD) has been reported to primarily increase ethanol formation in C. acetobutylicum. We found that overexpression of the AADD485G variant increased ethanol titers by 294%. Catalytic upgrading of the 824(aadD485G) ABE products resulted in a blend with nearly 50 wt%≤C9 products, which are unsuitable for diesel. To selectively increase butanol production, C. beijerinckii aldehyde dehydrogenase and C. ljungdhalii butanol dehydrogenase were co-expressed (strain designate 824(Cb ald-Cl bdh)), which increased butanol titers by 27% to 16.9 g L−1 while acetone and ethanol titers remained essentially unaffected. The solvent ratio from 824(Cb ald-Cl bdh) resulted in more than 80 wt% of catalysis products having a carbon chain length≥C11 which amounts to 9.8 g L−1 of products suitable as kerosene or diesel blendstock based on fermentation volume. To further increase solvent production, we investigated expression of both native and heterologous chaperones in C. acetobutylicum. Expression of a heat shock protein (HSP33) from Bacillus psychrosaccharolyticus increased the total solvent titer by 22%. Co-expression of HSP33 and aldehyde/butanol dehydrogenases further increased ABE formation as well as acetone and butanol yields. HSP33 was identified as the first heterologous chaperone that significantly increases solvent titers above wild type C. acetobutylicum levels, which can be combined with metabolic engineering to further increase solvent production.",

Here, we tested a novel strategy to improve penicillin production, namely the change of the residence of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis. We tested if targeting of AcvA or IpnA (or both) to peroxisomes would increase the penicillin yield. Indeed, AcvA peroxisomal targeting led to a 3.2-fold increase. In contrast, targeting IpnA to peroxisomes caused a complete loss of penicillin production. Overexpression of acvA, ipnA or aatA resulted in 1.4, 2.8 and 3.1-fold more penicillin, respectively in comparison to wildtype. Simultaneous overexpression of all three enzymes resulted even in 6-fold more penicillin. Combination of acvA peroxisomal targeting and overexpression of the gene led to 5-fold increase of the penicillin titer. At last, the number of peroxisomes was increased through overexpression of pexK. A strain with the double number of peroxisomes produced 2.3 times more penicillin. These results show that penicillin production can be triggered at several levels of regulation, one of which is the subcellular localization of the enzymes.",

The so constructed E. coli grew in glucose to form filamentary shapes with an improved P(3HB-co-4HB) accumulation around 10% more than its control strain without addition of 4HB precursor, reaching over 78% P(3HB-co-4HB) in CDW. Importantly, the shape changing E. coli was able to precipitate after 20 min stillstand. Finally, the filamentary recombinant E. coli was not only able to produce more P(3HB-co-4HB) from glucose but also allow convenient downstream separation from the fermentation broth.",

In this study, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered for the high-level production of TAL by overexpression of the Gerbera hybrida 2-pyrone synthase (2-PS) and systematic engineering of the yeast metabolic pathways. Pathway analysis and a computational approach were employed to target increases in cofactor and precursor pools to improve TAL synthesis. The pathways engineered include those for energy storage and generation, pentose biosynthesis, gluconeogenesis, lipid biosynthesis and regulation, cofactor transport, and fermentative capacity. Seventeen genes were selected for disruption and independently screened for their effect on TAL production; combinations of knockouts were then evaluated. A combination of the pathway engineering and optimal culture parameters led to a 37-fold increase in titer to 2.2 g/L and a 50-fold increase in yield to 0.13 (g/g glucose). These values are the highest reported in the literature, and provide a 3-fold improvement in yield over previous reports using S. cerevisiae. Identification of these metabolic bottlenecks provides a strategy for overproduction of other acetyl-CoA-dependent products in yeast.",

The notable features in our method are avoidance of plasmids and expensive inducers for foreign gene expression to reduce production costs; foreign genes are knocked into the chromosome, and their expression is induced with xylose that is present in most biomass feedstock. As loci for the gene knock-in, lacZYA and some pseudogenes are chosen to minimize unexpected effects of the knock-in on cell physiology. The promoter of xylF is inducible with xylose and is combined with the T7 RNA polymerase–T7 promoter system to ensure strong gene expression. This expression system was named BICES (biomass-inducible chromosome-based expression system). As examples of BICES application, 2,3-butanediol and acetoin were successfully produced from glucose and xylose, and the maximal concentrations reached 54 g L−1 [99.6% in (R,S)-form] and 31 g L−1, respectively. 2,3-Butanediol and acetoin are industrially important chemicals that are, at present, produced primarily through petrochemical processes.

Conversely, the growth rate and biomass yield of wild-type yeast were reduced. Cultivation in media lacking pantothenate eliminates the growth advantage of low-producing mutants, leading to improved production upon scale-up to lab-scale bioreactor testing. An omics investigation revealed that when exogenous pantothenate levels are limited, acyl-CoA metabolites decrease, β-oxidation decreases from unexpectedly high levels in the farnesene producer, and sterol and fatty acid synthesis likely limits the growth rate of the wild-type strain. Thus pantothenate supplementation can be utilized as a “metabolic switch” for tuning the synthesis rates of molecules relying on CoA intermediates and aid the economic scale-up of strains producing acyl-CoA derived molecules to manufacturing facilities.",

     "abstract": "Advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering have enabled the construction of novel biological routes to valuable chemicals using suitable microbial hosts. Aldehydes serve as chemical feedstocks in the synthesis of rubbers, plastics, and other larger molecules. Microbial production of alkanes is dependent on the formation of a fatty aldehyde intermediate which is converted to an alkane by an aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO). However, microbial hosts such as Escherichia coli are plagued by many highly active endogenous aldehyde reductases (ALRs) that convert aldehydes to alcohols, which greatly complicates strain engineering for aldehyde and alkane production. It has been shown that the endogenous ALR activity outcompetes the ADO enzyme for fatty aldehyde substrate. The large degree of ALR redundancy coupled with an incomplete database of ALRs represents a significant obstacle in engineering E. coli for either aldehyde or alkane production. In this study, we identified 44 ALR candidates encoded in the E. coli genome using bioinformatics tools, and undertook a comprehensive screening by measuring the ability of these enzymes to produce isobutanol. From the pool of 44 candidates, we found five new ALRs using this screening method (YahK, DkgA, GldA, YbbO, and YghA). Combined deletions of all 13 known ALRs resulted in a 90–99% reduction in endogenous ALR activity for a wide range of aldehyde substrates (C2–C12). Elucidation of the ALRs found in E. coli could guide one in reducing competing alcohol formation during alkane or aldehyde production.",

To be of value for industrial biotechnology, mathematical models should be able to assist in the rational design of cell factory properties or in the production processes in which they are utilized. Kinetic models are particularly suitable towards this end because they are capable of representing the complex biochemistry of cells in a more complete way compared to most other types of models. They can, at least in principle, be used to in detail understand, predict, and evaluate the effects of adding, removing, or modifying molecular components of a cell factory and for supporting the design of the bioreactor or fermentation process. However, several challenges still remain before kinetic modeling will reach the degree of maturity required for routine application in industry.

Lately, major attention has been paid to biotechnological approaches, using cell extracts or whole-cell systems for the production of (+)-nootkatone. In our study, the yeast Pichia pastoris initially was applied as whole-cell biocatalyst for the production of (+)-nootkatone from (+)-valencene, the abundant aroma compound of oranges. Therefore, we generated a strain co-expressing the premnaspirodiene oxygenase of Hyoscyamus muticus (HPO) and the Arabidopsis thaliana cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) that hydroxylated extracellularly added (+)-valencene. Intracellular production of (+)-valencene by co-expression of valencene synthase from Callitropsis nootkatensis resolved the phase-transfer issues of (+)-valencene. Bi-phasic cultivations of P. pastoris resulted in the production of trans-nootkatol, which was oxidized to (+)-nootkatone by an intrinsic P. pastoris activity. Additional overexpression of a P. pastoris alcohol dehydrogenase and truncated hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (tHmg1p) significantly enhanced the (+)-nootkatone yield to 208 mg L−1 cell culture in bioreactor cultivations.

In this study, different combinations of five l-sorbose dehydrogenases (SDH) and two l-sorbosone dehydrogenases (SNDH) from Ketogulonicigenium vulgare WSH-001 were introduced into Gluconobacter oxydans WSH-003, an industrial strain used for the conversion of d-sorbitol to l-sorbose.

In this work, we further improved GlcNAc titer through spatial modulation of key pathway enzymes and by blocking sporulation and decreasing maintenance metabolism. Specifically, a DNA-guided scaffold system was firstly used to modulate the activities of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase and GlcNAc-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase, increasing the GlcNAc titer from 1.83 g/L to 4.55 g/L in a shake flask. Next, sporulation was blocked by respectively deleting spo0A (gene encoding the initiation regulon of sporulation) and sigE (gene encoding RNA polymerase sporulation-specific sigma factor). Deletion of sigE more effectively blocked sporulation without altering cell growth or GlcNAc production. The respiration chain was then engineered to decrease the maintenance metabolism of recombinant B. subtilis by deleting cydB and cydC, genes encoding cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase (subunit II) and ATP-binding protein for the expression of cytochrome bd, respectively. The respiration-engineered B. subtilis produced 6.15 g/L GlcNAc in a shake flask and 20.58 g/L GlcNAc in a 3-L fed-batch bioreactor.

During metabolic evolution to improve succinate production in Escherichia coli strains, two reducing equivalent-conserving pathways were activated to increase succinate yield. The sensitivity of pyruvate dehydrogenase to NADH inhibition was eliminated by three nucleotide mutations in the lpdA gene. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity increased under anaerobic conditions, which provided additional NADH. The pentose phosphate pathway and transhydrogenase were activated by increased activities of transketolase and soluble transhydrogenase SthA. These data suggest that more carbon flux went through the pentose phosphate pathway, thus leading to production of more reducing equivalent in the form of NADPH, which was then converted to NADH through soluble transhydrogenase for succinate production. Reverse metabolic engineering was further performed in a parent strain, which was not metabolically evolved, to verify the effects of activating these two reducing equivalent-conserving pathways for improving succinate yield. Activating pyruvate dehydrogenase increased succinate yield from 1.12 to 1.31 mol/mol, whereas activating the pentose phosphate pathway and transhydrogenase increased succinate yield from 1.12 to 1.33 mol/mol.

     "abstract": "Recently it was shown that monoterpenes in tomato trichomes (Solanum lycopersicum) are synthesized by phellandrene synthase 1 (PHS1) from the non-canonical substrate neryl diphosphate (NPP), the cis-isomer of geranyl diphosphate (GPP). As PHS1 accepts both NPP and GPP substrates forming different monoterpenes, it was overexpressed in tomato fruits to test if NPP is also available in a tissue highly active in carotenoid production. However, transgenic fruits overexpressing PHS1 produced only small amounts of GPP-derived PHS1 monoterpene products, indicating the absence of endogenous NPP. Therefore, NPP formation was achieved by diverting the metabolic flux from carotenoids via expression of tomato neryl diphosphate synthase 1 (NDPS1). NDPS1 transgenic fruits produced NPP-derived monoterpenes, including nerol, neral and geranial, while displaying reduced lycopene content. NDPS1 co-expression with PHS1 resulted in a monoterpene blend, including β-phellandrene, similar to that produced from NPP by PHS1 in vitro and in trichomes. Unexpectedly, PHS1×NDPS1 fruits showed recovery of lycopene levels compared to NDPS1 fruits, suggesting that redirection of metabolic flux is only partially responsible for the reduction in carotenoids. In vitro assays demonstrated that NPP serves as an inhibitor of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, thus its consumption by PHS1 leads to recovery of lycopene levels. Monoterpenes produced in PHS1×NDPS1 fruits contributed to direct plant defense negatively affecting feeding behavior of the herbivore Helicoverpa zea and displaying antifungal activity against Botrytis cinerea. These results show that NPP-derived terpenoids can be produced in plant tissues; however, NPP has to be consumed to avoid negative impacts on plant metabolism.",

Overexpression targets were localized in the pentose phosphate pathway and the TCA cycle, while knockout targets were found in several branch points of glycolysis. Five out of 9 tested targets led to an enhanced production of cytosolic human superoxide dismutase (hSOD). Expression of bacterial β-glucuronidase could be enhanced as well by most of the same genetic modifications. Beneficial mutations were mainly related to reduction of the NADP/H pool and the deletion of fermentative pathways. Overexpression of the hSOD gene itself had a strong impact on intracellular fluxes, most of which changed in the same direction as predicted by the model. In vivo fluxes changed in the same direction as predicted to improve hSOD production. Genome scale metabolic modeling is shown to predict overexpression and deletion mutants which enhance recombinant protein production with high accuracy.",

     "abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae has increasingly been engineered as a cell factory for efficient and economic production of fuels and chemicals from renewable resources. Notably, a wide variety of industrially important products are derived from the same precursor metabolite, acetyl-CoA. However, the limited supply of acetyl-CoA in the cytosol, where biosynthesis generally happens, often leads to low titer and yield of the desired products in yeast. In the present work, combined strategies of disrupting competing pathways and introducing heterologous biosynthetic pathways were carried out to increase acetyl-CoA levels by using the CoA-dependent n-butanol production as a reporter. By inactivating ADH1 and ADH4 for ethanol formation and GPD1 and GPD2 for glycerol production, the glycolytic flux was redirected towards acetyl-CoA, resulting in 4-fold improvement in n-butanol production. Subsequent introduction of heterologous acetyl-CoA biosynthetic pathways, including pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), ATP-dependent citrate lyase (ACL), and PDH-bypass, further increased n-butanol production. Recombinant PDHs localized in the cytosol (cytoPDHs) were found to be the most efficient, which increased n-butanol production by additional 3 fold. In total, n-butanol titer and acetyl-CoA concentration were increased more than 12 fold and 3 fold, respectively. By combining the most effective and complementary acetyl-CoA pathways, more than 100 mg/L n-butanol could be produced using high cell density fermentation, which represents the highest titer ever reported in yeast using the clostridial CoA-dependent pathway.",

Through a combined genome-wide screening of stage-specific promoters and the balancing of the metabolic flux, ethanol yields and productivity from mixed sugars were significantly improved. In a medium containing 50 g/L glucose and 50 g/L xylose, the top-performing strain WXY12 rapidly consumed glucose within 12 h and within 84 h it consistently achieved an ethanol yield of 0.48 g/g total sugar, which was 94% of the theoretical yield. WXY12 utilizes a KGD1 inducible promoter to drive xylose metabolism, resulting in much higher ethanol yield than a reference strain using a strong constitutive PGK1 promoter. These promising results validate the TSTR strategy by synthetically regulating the xylose assimilation pathway towards efficient xylose fermentation.",

     "abstract": "We have recently reported the development of an efficient, whole-cell process for chemoenzymatic production of key chiral intermediates in statin synthesis by employing high-density Escherichia coli culture with the overexpressed deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase (DERA). The optically pure, 6-substituted cyclic hemiacetals can be used for the synthesis of atorvastatin, rosuvastatin and pitavastatin using further chemical steps. All of the synthetic routes established to date begin with a regiospecific oxidation of these lactol intermediates into the corresponding lactones, followed by several steps yielding 6-substituted, open-chain or lactonized derivatives which can be coupled by various approaches with the heterocyclic part of the statin molecule. Here we report for the first time the use of PQQ-dependent glucose dehydrogenases for a highly efficient, regioselective oxidation of artificial, derivatized aldohexoses, more specifically, the statin lactol intermediates. First, PQQ-dependent dehydrogenases of both soluble and membrane-bound type were characterized for their activity toward various DERA-derived lactols. Further, we describe a highly productive whole-cell system for oxidation of these 2,4-dideoxyaldopyranoses using a PQQ-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (Gcd) overexpressed in E. coli while taking advantage of the respiratory chain as the mediator of the electron transfer to oxygen. Finally, a two-step artificial biosynthetic pathway was developed by unleashing the intrinsic genetic potential of E. coli. The combined overexpression of the endogenous DERA and the membrane-bound, PQQ-dependent glucose dehydrogenase, the latter being coupled to the respiratory chain, allows direct biosynthesis of 6-substituted lactones in a highly productive, high-yield, cost-effective and industrially scalable process.",

In this work, we have characterized aerobic growth characteristics of T. thermophilus HB8 at temperatures between 50 and 85 °C, constructed a metabolic network model of its central carbon metabolism and validated the model using 13C-metabolic flux analysis (13C–MFA). First, cells were grown in batch cultures in custom constructed mini-bioreactors at different temperatures to determine optimal growth conditions. The optimal temperature for T. thermophilus grown on defined medium with glucose was 81 °C. The maximum growth rate was 0.25 h−1. Between 50 and 81 °C the growth rate increased by 7-fold and the temperature dependence was described well by an Arrhenius model with an activation energy of 47 kJ/mol. Next, we performed a 13C-labeling experiment with [1,2-13C] glucose as the tracer and calculated intracellular metabolic fluxes using 13C–MFA. The results provided support for the constructed network model and highlighted several interesting characteristics of T. thermophilus metabolism. We found that T. thermophilus largely uses glycolysis and TCA cycle to produce biosynthetic precursors, ATP and reducing equivalents needed for cells growth. Consistent with its proposed metabolic network model, we did not detect any oxidative pentose phosphate pathway flux or Entner-Doudoroff pathway activity. The biomass precursors erythrose-4-phosphate and ribose-5-phosphate were produced via the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, and largely via transketolase, with little contribution from transaldolase. The high biomass yield on glucose that was measured experimentally was also confirmed independently by 13C–MFA. The results presented here provide a solid foundation for future studies of T. thermophilus and its metabolic engineering applications.",

In lipid research, there is a big gap between the currently available pathway-level representations of lipids and lipid structure databases in which the number of compounds is expanding rapidly with high-throughput mass spectrometry methods.In this work, we introduce a computational approach to bridge this gap by making associations between metabolic pathways and the lipid structures discovered increasingly thorough lipidomics studies. Our approach, called NICELips (Network Integrated Computational Explorer for Lipidomics), is based on the formulation of generalized enzymatic reaction rules for lipid metabolism, and it employs the generalized rules to postulate novel pathways of lipid metabolism. It further integrates all discovered lipids in biological networks of enzymatic reactions that consist their biosynthesis and biodegradation pathways.We illustrate the utility of our approach through a case study of bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a biologically important glycerophospholipid with immature synthesis and catabolic route(s). Using NICELips, we were able to propose various synthesis and degradation pathways for this compound and several other lipids with unknown metabolism like BMP, and in addition several alternative novel biosynthesis and biodegradation pathways for lipids with known metabolism. NICELips has potential applications in designing therapeutic interventions for lipid-associated disorders and in the metabolic engineering of model organisms for improving the biobased production of lipid-derived fuels and chemicals.",

Integrating these multiple levels of information, we were able to investigate the interaction of glycolysis and TCA cycle and its metabolic control. We characterized metabolic phases in CHO batch cultivation and assessed metabolic efficiency extending the concept of metabolic ratios. Comparing in situ enzyme activities including their compartmental localization with in vivo metabolic fluxes, we were able to identify limiting steps in glycolysis and TCA cycle. Our data point to a significant contribution of substrate channeling to glycolytic regulation. We show how glycolytic channeling heavily affects the availability of pyruvate for the mitochondria. Finally, we show that the activities of transaminases and anaplerotic enzymes are tailored to permit a balanced supply of pyruvate and oxaloacetate to the TCA cycle in the respective metabolic states. We demonstrate that knowledge about metabolic control can be gained by correlating in vivo metabolic flux dynamics with time and space resolved in situ enzyme activities.",

In this work, the production of 2,3-BD by recombinant E. coli strains was optimized by applying a systematic approach. 2,3-BD biosynthesis gene clusters were cloned from several native 2,3-BD producers, including Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Enterobacter cloacae, inserted into the expression vector pET28a, and compared for 2,3-BD synthesis. The recombinant strain E. coli BL21/pETPT7-EcABC, carrying the 2,3-BD pathway gene cluster from Enterobacter cloacae, showed the best ability to synthesize 2,3-BD. Thereafter, expression of the most efficient gene cluster was optimized by using different promoters, including PT7, Ptac, Pc, and Pabc. E. coli BL21/pET-RABC with Pabc as promoter was superior in 2,3-BD synthesis. On the basis of the results of biomass and extracellular metabolite profiling analyses, fermentation conditions, including pH, agitation speed, and aeration rate, were optimized for the efficient production of 2,3-BD. After fed-batch fermentation under the optimized conditions, 73.8 g/L of 2,3-BD was produced by using E. coli BL21/pET-RABC within 62 h. The values of both yield and productivity of 2,3-BD obtained with the optimized biological system are the highest ever achieved with an engineered E. coli strain.

First, two-promoter systems with different promoter types and strengths were used for combinatorial assembly of expression cassettes of glmS (encoding GlcN-6-phosphate synthase) and GNA1 (encoding GlcNAc-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase) at transcriptional levels in the GlcNAc synthesis module, resulting in a 32.4% increase in GlcNAc titer (from 1.85 g/L to 2.45 g/L) in shake flasks.

At present, MA and SA are commercially produced by organic chemical synthesis using petro-derived aromatic chemicals, such as benzene, as starting materials, which is not environmentally friendly. Here, we report a novel approach for efficient microbial production of MA via extending shikimate pathway by introducing the hybrid of an SA biosynthetic pathway with its partial degradation pathway. First, we engineered a well-developed phenylalanine producing Escherichia coli strain into an SA overproducer by introducing isochorismate synthase and isochorismate pyruvate lyase. The engineered strain is able to produce 1.2 g/L of SA from simple carbon sources, which is the highest titer reported so far. Further, the partial SA degradation pathway involving salicylate 1-monoxygenase and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase is established to achieve the conversion of SA to MA. Finally, a de novo MA biosynthetic pathway is assembled by integrating the established SA biosynthesis and degradation modules. Modular optimization enables the production of up to 1.5 g/L MA within 48 h in shake flasks. This study not only establishes an efficient microbial platform for the production of SA and MA, but also demonstrates a generalizable pathway design strategy for the de novo biosynthesis of valuable degradation metabolites.",

The introduction of transcriptional (promoters), translational (ribosome binding site (RBS)) and enzyme (mutant genes) variability to modulate pathway expression levels is essential for generating balanced metabolic pathways and maximizing the productivity of a strain. We report a novel, highly reliable and rapid single strand assembly (SSA) method for pathway engineering. The method was successfully optimized and applied to create constructs containing promoter, RBS and/or mutant enzyme libraries. To demonstrate its efficiency and reliability, the method was applied to fine-tune multi-gene pathways. Two promoter libraries were simultaneously introduced in front of two target genes, enabling orthogonal expression as demonstrated by principal component analysis. This shows that SSA will increase our ability to tune multi-gene pathways at all control levels for the biotechnological production of complex metabolites, achievable through the combinatorial modulation of transcription, translation and enzyme activity.",

In two 500 L pilot-scale fermentor studies lasting 70 h, the above engineered Halomonas TD01 grew to 112 g/L CDW containing 70 wt% P3HB, and to 80 g/L CDW with 70 wt% P(3HB-co-8 mol% 3HV) in the presence of propionic acid. The cells grown in shake flasks even accumulated close to 92% PHB in CDW with a significant increase of glucose to PHB conversion efficiency from around 30% to 42% after 48 h cultivation when pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase was overexpressed. Halomonas TD01 was also engineered for producing a PHA regulatory protein PhaR which is a robust biosurfactant.",

Here we report the engineering of an industrially friendly host, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to produce BDO at high titer and yield. By inactivation of pyruvate decarboxylases (PDCs) followed by overexpression of MTH1 and adaptive evolution, the resultant yeast grew on glucose as the sole carbon source with ethanol production completely eliminated. Moreover, the pdc- strain consumed glucose and galactose simultaneously, which to our knowledge is unprecedented in S. cerevisiae strains. Subsequent introduction of a BDO biosynthetic pathway consisting of the cytosolic acetolactate synthase (cytoILV2), Bacillus subtilis acetolactate decarboxylase (BsAlsD), and the endogenous butanediol dehydrogenase (BDH1) resulted in the production of enantiopure (2R,3R)-butanediol (R-BDO). In shake flask fermentation, a yield over 70% of the theoretical value was achieved. Using fed-batch fermentation, more than 100 g/L R-BDO (1100 mM) was synthesized from a mixture of glucose and galactose, two major carbohydrate components in red algae. The high titer and yield of the enantiopure R-BDO produced as well as the ability to co-ferment glucose and galactose make our engineered yeast strain a superior host for cost-effective production of bio-based BDO from renewable resources.",

While the pathway has recently been exploited for the production of n-alcohols and carboxylic acids, fully capitalizing on its potential for the synthesis of a diverse set of product families requires a system-level assessment of its biosynthetic capabilities. To this end, we utilized a genome scale model of Escherichia coli, in combination with Flux Balance Analysis and Flux Variability Analysis, to determine the key characteristics and constraints of this pathway for the production of a variety of product families under fermentative conditions. This analysis revealed that the production of n-alcohols, alkanes, and fatty acids of lengths C3–C18 could be coupled to cell growth in a strain lacking native fermentative pathways, a characteristic enabling product synthesis at maximum rates, titers, and yields. While energetic and redox constraints limit the production of target compounds from alternative platforms such as the fatty acid biosynthesis and α-ketoacid pathways, the metabolic efficiency of a β-oxidation reversal allows the production of a wide range of products of varying length and functionality. The versatility of this platform was investigated through the simulation of various termination pathways for product synthesis along with the use of different priming molecules, demonstrating its potential for the efficient synthesis of a wide variety of functionalized compounds. Overall, specific metabolic manipulations suggested by this systems-level analysis include deletion of native fermentation pathways, the choice of priming molecules and specific routes for their synthesis, proper choice of termination enzymes, control of flux partitioning at the pyruvate node and the pentose phosphate pathway, and the use of an NADH-dependent trans-enoyl-CoA reductase instead of a ferredoxin-dependent enzyme.",

For enhancing 3-HP production, this study aimed to investigate metabolic engineering strategies towards eliminating by-products of 3-HP as well as optimizing the glycerol metabolism. The removal of genes involved in the generation of major by-products of 3-HP including acetate and 1,3-propanediol increased both 3-HP production level (28.1 g/L) and its average yield (0.217 g/g). Optimization of l-arabinose inducible expression of glycerol kinase GlpK, which catalyzes the conversion of glycerol to glycerol-3-phosphate, was also made to increase the metabolic flow from glycerol to 3-HP. To activate the whole glycerol metabolism towards 3-HP, the regulatory factor repressing the utilization of glycerol in Escherichia coli, encoded by glpR was eliminated by knocking-out in its chromosomal DNA. The resulting strain showed a significant improvement in the glycerol utilization rate as well as 3-HP titer (40.5 g/L). The transcriptional analysis of glpR deletion mutant revealed the poor expression of glycerol facilitator GlpF, which is involved in glycerol transport in the cell. Additional expression of glpF in the glpR deletion mutant successfully led to an increase in 3-HP production (42.1 g/L) and an average yield (0.268 g/g).",

Increasing the butyric acid selectivity important for economical butyric acid production has been rather difficult in clostridia due to their complex metabolic pathways. In this work, Clostridium acetobutylicum was metabolically engineered for highly selective butyric acid production. For this purpose, the second butyrate kinase of C. acetobutylicum encoded by the bukII gene instead of butyrate kinase I encoded by the buk gene was employed. Furthermore, metabolic pathways were engineered to further enhance the NADH-driving force. Batch fermentation of the metabolically engineered C. acetobutylicum strain HCBEKW (pta−, buk−, ctfB− and adhE1−) at pH 6.0 resulted in the production of 32.5 g/L of butyric acid with a butyric-to-acetic acid ratio (BA/AA ratio) of 31.3 g/g from 83.3 g/L of glucose. By further knocking out the hydA gene (encoding hydrogenase) in the HCBEKW strain, the butyric acid titer was not further improved in batch fermentation. However, the BA/AA ratio (28.5 g/g) obtained with the HYCBEKW strain (pta−, buk−, ctfB−, adhE1− and hydA−) was 1.6 times higher than that (18.2 g/g) obtained with the HCBEKW strain at pH 5.0, while no improvement was observed at pH 6.0. These results suggested that the buk gene knockout was essential to get a high butyric acid selectivity to acetic acid in C. acetobutylicum.",

We have reconstituted the fatty acid synthase (FAS) of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 and subjected it to in vitro kinetic analysis. Our data revealed that the overall rate of this metabolic pathway is exclusively limited by the FabH ketosynthase, which initiates product synthesis by condensing malonyl-ACP with acetyl-CoA to form acetoacetyl-ACP. This finding sharply contrasts with our previous findings that the Escherichia coli FAS is predominantly limited by its dehydratase (FabZ) and enoyl reductase (FabI) activities and that FabH activity is not limiting. We therefore reconstituted and analyzed a set of “hybrid” FASs. When the Synechococcus FabH was used to replace its counterpart in the reconstituted E. coli FAS, the resulting synthase was strongly limited by FabH activity. Conversely, replacement of the E. coli FabZ with its Synechococcus homolog dramatically alleviated the dependence of E. coli FAS activity on FabZ. In agreement with this finding, introduction of the E. coli FabH in the Synechococcus FAS virtually eliminated its dependence on this subunit, whereas substitution of the Synechococcus FabZ with its E. coli homolog shifted a substantial fraction of the overall flux control in the Synechococcus FAS to FabZ.

     "abstract": "The heterotrophic, hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus is a new addition to the growing list of genetically-tractable microorganisms suitable for metabolic engineering to produce liquid fuels and industrial chemicals. P. furiosus was recently engineered to generate 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) from CO2 and acetyl-CoA by the heterologous-expression of three enzymes from the CO2 fixation cycle of the thermoacidophilic archaeon Metallosphaera sedula using a thermally-triggered induction system. The acetyl-CoA for this pathway is generated from glucose catabolism that in wild-type P. furiosus is converted to acetate with concurrent ATP production by the heterotetrameric (α2β2) acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS). Hence ACS in the engineered 3-HP production strain (MW56) competes with the heterologous pathway for acetyl-CoA. Herein we show that strains of MW56 lacking the α-subunit of either of the two ACSs previously characterized from P. furiosus (ACSI and ACSII) exhibit a three-fold increase in specific 3-HP production. The ΔACSIα strain displayed only a minor defect in growth on either maltose or peptides, while no growth defect on these substrates was observed with the ΔACSIIα strain. Deletion of individual and multiple ACS subunits was also shown to decrease CoA release activity for several different CoA ester substrates in addition to acetyl-CoA, information that will be extremely useful for future metabolic engineering endeavors in P. furiosus.",

     "abstract": "In Penicillium chrysogenum the beta-lactam biosynthetic pathway is compartmentalized. This fact forces the occurrence of transport processes of penicillin-intermediate molecules across cell membranes. Many aspects around this molecular traffic remain obscure but are supposed to involve transmembrane transporter proteins. In the present work, an in-depth study has been developed on a Major Facilitator-type secondary transporter from P. chrysogenum named as PenM. The reduction of penM expression level reached by penM targeted silencing, leads to a decrease in benzylpenicillin production in silenced transformants, especially in SilM-35. On the contrary, the penM overexpression from a high efficiency promoter increases the benzylpenicillin production and the expression of the biosynthetic genes. Moreover, when the silenced strain SilM-35 is cultured under penicillin production conditions with 6-aminopenicillanic acid supplementation, an increase in the benzylpenicillin production proportional to the 6-aminopenicillanic acid availability is observed. By this phenomenon, it can be concluded that due to the penM silencing the benzylpenicillin transport remains intact but the peroxisomal isopenicillin N import results affected. As a culminating result, obtained by the expression of the fluorescent recombinant PenM-DsRed protein, it was determined that PenM is naturally located in P. chrysogenum peroxisomes. In summary, our experimental results suggest that PenM is involved in penicillin production most likely through the translocation of isopenicillin N from the cytosol to the peroxisomal lumen across P. chrysogenum peroxisomal membrane.",

For enabling a sustainable alternative to petrochemicals as the feedstock for these commercially important chemicals, fermentative production of 3-HP is widely investigated and is centered on bacterial systems in most cases. However, bacteria present certain drawbacks for large-scale organic acid production. In this study, we have evaluated the production of 3-HP in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae through a route from malonyl-CoA, because this allows performing the fermentation at low pH thus making the overall process cheaper. We have further engineered the host strain by increasing availability of the precursor malonyl-CoA and by coupling the production with increased NADPH supply we were able to substantially improve 3-HP production by five-fold, up to a final titer of 463 mg l−1. Our work thus led to a demonstration of 3-HP production in yeast via the malonyl-CoA pathway, and this opens for the use of yeast as a cell factory for production of bio-based 3-HP and derived acrylates in the future.",

     "abstract": "Cytosolic acetyl-coenzyme A is a precursor for many biotechnologically relevant compounds produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this yeast, cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis and growth strictly depend on expression of either the Acs1 or Acs2 isoenzyme of acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS). Since hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and pyrophosphate in the ACS reaction constrains maximum yields of acetyl-CoA-derived products, this study explores replacement of ACS by two ATP-independent pathways for acetyl-CoA synthesis. After evaluating expression of different bacterial genes encoding acetylating acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (A-ALD) and pyruvate-formate lyase (PFL), acs1Δ acs2Δ S. cerevisiae strains were constructed in which A-ALD or PFL successfully replaced ACS. In A-ALD-dependent strains, aerobic growth rates of up to 0.27 h−1 were observed, while anaerobic growth rates of PFL-dependent S. cerevisiae (0.20 h−1) were stoichiometrically coupled to formate production. In glucose-limited chemostat cultures, intracellular metabolite analysis did not reveal major differences between A-ALD-dependent and reference strains. However, biomass yields on glucose of A-ALD- and PFL-dependent strains were lower than those of the reference strain. Transcriptome analysis suggested that reduced biomass yields were caused by acetaldehyde and formate in A-ALD- and PFL-dependent strains, respectively. Transcript profiles also indicated that a previously proposed role of Acs2 in histone acetylation is probably linked to cytosolic acetyl-CoA levels rather than to direct involvement of Acs2 in histone acetylation. While demonstrating that yeast ACS can be fully replaced, this study demonstrates that further modifications are needed to achieve optimal in vivo performance of the alternative reactions for supply of cytosolic acetyl-CoA as a product precursor.",

Here, the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 was genetically modified to photosynthetically produce mannitol from CO2 as the sole carbon source. Two codon-optimized genes, mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (mtlD) from Escherichia coli and mannitol-1-phosphatase (mlp) from the protozoan chicken parasite Eimeria tenella, in combination encoding a biosynthetic pathway from fructose-6-phosphate to mannitol, were expressed in the cyanobacterium resulting in accumulation of mannitol in the cells and in the culture medium. The mannitol biosynthetic genes were expressed from a single synthetic operon inserted into the cyanobacterial chromosome by homologous recombination. The mannitol biosynthesis operon was constructed using a novel uracil-specific excision reagent (USER)-based polycistronic expression system characterized by ligase-independent, directional cloning of the protein-encoding genes such that the insertion site was regenerated after each cloning step. Genetic inactivation of glycogen biosynthesis increased the yield of mannitol presumably by redirecting the metabolic flux to mannitol under conditions where glycogen normally accumulates. A total mannitol yield equivalent to 10% of cell dry weight was obtained in cell cultures synthesizing glycogen while the yield increased to 32% of cell dry weight in cell cultures deficient in glycogen synthesis; in both cases about 75% of the mannitol was released from the cells into the culture medium by an unknown mechanism. The highest productivity was obtained in a glycogen synthase deficient culture that after 12 days showed a mannitol concentration of 1.1 g mannitol L−1 and a production rate of 0.15 g mannitol L−1 day−1.

Here, we present a strategy of combinational genetic manipulation to enrich the precursors available for Sal B biosynthesis. This approach, involving the lignin pathway, requires simultaneous, ectopic expression of an Arabidopsis Production of Anthocyanin Pigment 1 transcription factor (AtPAP1) plus co-suppression of two endogenous, key enzyme genes: cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (SmCCR) and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (SmCOMT). Compared with the untransformed control, we achieved a greater accumulation of Sal B (up to 3-fold higher) along with a reduced lignin concentration. This high-Sal B phenotype was stable in roots during vegetative growth and was closely correlated with increased antioxidant capacity for the corresponding plant extracts. Although no outward change in phenotype was apparent, we characterized the molecular phenotype through integrated analysis of transcriptome and metabolome profiling. Our results demonstrated the far-reaching consequences of phenolic pathway perturbations on carbohydrate metabolism, respiration, photo-respiration, and stress responses.

These switches provide unprecedented precision, complexity and reliability when programming novel mammalian cell functions. Metabolite-responsive repressors of human-pathogenic bacteria are particularly attractive for use in these orthogonal synthetic mammalian gene switches because the trigger compound sensitivity often matches the human physiological range. We have designed both a bile acid-repressible (BEAROFF) as well as a bile-acid-inducible (BEARON) gene switch by capitalizing on components that have evolved to manage bile acid resistance in Campylobacter jejuni, the leading causative agent of human food-borne enteritis. We have shown that both of these switches enable bile acid-adjustable transgene expression in different mammalian cell lines as well as in mice. For the BEAROFF device, the C. jejuni repressor CmeR was fused to the VP16 transactivation domain to create a synthetic transactivator that activates minimal promoters containing tandem operator modules (Ocme) in a bile acid-repressible manner. Fusion of CmeR to a transsilencing domain resulted in an artificial transsilencer that binds and represses a constitutive Ocme-containing promoter until it is released by addition of bile acid (BEARON). A tailored multi-step tuning program for the inducible gene switch, which included the optimization of individual component performance, control of their relative abundances, the choice of the cell line and trigger compound, resulted in a BEARON device with significantly improved bile acid-responsive control characteristics. Synthetic metabolite-triggered gene switches that are able to interface with host metabolism may foster advances in future gene and cell-based therapies.",

This allowed the expression of the difficult-to-express protein to high yields, and it also increased the production of an easy-to-express protein.

Here, we engineered the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce fatty acid-derived biofuels and chemicals from simple sugars.

Understanding that TAG cannot be used directly as fuels, we also engineered S. cerevisiae to produce drop-in fuels and chemicals. Altering the terminal “converting enzyme” in the engineered strain led to the production of free fatty acids at a titer of approximately 400 mg/L, fatty alcohols at approximately 100 mg/L and fatty acid ethyl esters (biodiesel) at approximately 5 mg/L directly from simple sugars.

In the present work, systems-wide metabolic engineering was applied to target Escherichia coli, a widely accepted recombinant host in pharmaceutical biotechnology, for production of these high-value products. The basic producer, E. coli dVio-1, that expressed the vioABCE cluster from Chromobacterium violaceum under control of the inducible araC system, accumulated 180 mg L−1 of deoxyviolacein. Targeted intracellular metabolite analysis then identified bottlenecks in tryptophan supporting pathways, the major product building block. This was used for comprehensive engineering of serine, chorismate and tryptophan biosynthesis and the non-oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway. The final strain, E. coli dVio-6, accumulated 320 mg L−1 deoxyviolacein in shake flask cultures. The created chassis of a high-flux tryptophan pathway was complemented by genomic integration of the vioD gene of Janthinobacterium lividum, which enabled exclusive production of violacein. In a fed-batch process, the resulting producer E. coli Vio-4 accumulated 710 mg L−1 of the desired product. With straightforward broth extraction and subsequent crystallization, violacein could be obtained with 99.8% purity. This demonstrates the potential of E. coli as a platform for production of tryptophan based therapeutics.",

     "abstract": "13C-Metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) is a powerful model-based analysis technique for determining intracellular metabolic fluxes in living cells. It has become a standard tool in many labs for quantifying cell physiology, e.g., in metabolic engineering, systems biology, biotechnology, and biomedical research. With the increasing number of 13C-MFA studies published each year, it is now ever more important to provide practical guidelines for performing and publishing 13C-MFA studies so that quality is not sacrificed as the number of publications increases. The main purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of good practices in 13C-MFA, which can eventually be used as minimum data standards for publishing 13C-MFA studies. The motivation for this work is two-fold: (1) currently, there is no general consensus among researchers and journal editors as to what minimum data standards should be required for publishing 13C-MFA studies; as a result, there are great discrepancies in terms of quality and consistency; and (2) there is a growing number of studies that cannot be reproduced or verified independently due to incomplete information provided in these publications. This creates confusion, e.g. when trying to reconcile conflicting results, and hinders progress in the field. Here, we review current status in the 13C-MFA field and highlight some of the shortcomings with regards to 13C-MFA publications. We then propose a checklist that encompasses good practices in 13C-MFA. We hope that these guidelines will be a valuable resource for the community and allow 13C-flux studies to be more easily reproduced and accessed by others in the future.",

The COMPLETE-MFA method is based on combined analysis of multiple isotopic labeling experiments, where the synergy of using complementary tracers greatly improves the precision of estimated fluxes. In this work, we demonstrate the COMPLETE-MFA approach using all singly labeled glucose tracers, [1-13C], [2-13C], [3-13C], [4-13C], [5-13C], and [6-13C]glucose to determine precise metabolic fluxes for wild-type Escherichia coli. Cells were grown in six parallel cultures on defined medium with glucose as the only carbon source. Mass isotopomers of biomass amino acids were measured by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The data from all six experiments were then fitted simultaneously to a single flux model to determine accurate intracellular fluxes. We obtained a statistically acceptable fit with more than 300 redundant measurements. The estimated flux map is the most precise flux result obtained thus far for E. coli cells. To our knowledge, this is the first time that six isotopic labeling experiments have been successfully integrated for high-resolution 13C-flux analysis.",

However, it is difficult to achieve optimal redox rebalancing of synthetic pathways owing to the sensitive responses of cellular physiology according as the intracellular redox state changes. Here, we demonstrate optimal rebalancing of the intracellular redox state by model-driven control of expression using n-butanol production in Escherichia coli as a model system. The synthetic n-butanol production pathway was constructed by implementing synthetic constitutive promoters and designing synthetic 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTR) for each gene. Redox rebalancing was achieved by anaerobically activating the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex and additionally tuning the expression level of NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase (fdh1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae) through rational UTR engineering. Interestingly, efficient production of n-butanol required different amounts of reducing equivalents depending on whether the substrate was glucose or galactose. One intriguing implication of this work is that additional strain improvement can be achieved, even within given genetic components, through rebalancing intracellular redox state according to target products and substrates.",

     "abstract": "Use of lignocellulosic biomass as a second generation feedstock in the biofuels industry is a pressing challenge. Among other difficulties in using lignocellulosic biomass, one major challenge is the optimal utilization of both 6-carbon (glucose) and 5-carbon (xylose) sugars by industrial microorganisms. Most industrial microorganisms preferentially utilize glucose over xylose owing to the regulatory phenomenon of carbon catabolite repression (CCR). Microorganisms that can co-utilize glucose and xylose are of considerable interest to the biofuels industry due to their ability to simplify the fermentation processes. However, elimination of CCR in microorganisms is challenging due to the multiple coordinating mechanisms involved. We report a novel algorithm, SIMUP, which finds metabolic engineering strategies to force co-utilization of two sugars, without targeting the regulatory pathways of CCR. Mutants of Escherichia coli based on SIMUP algorithm showed predicted growth phenotypes and co-utilized glucose and xylose; however, consumed the sugars slower than the wild-type. Some solutions identified by the algorithm were based on stoichiometric imbalance and were not obvious from the metabolic network topology. Furthermore, sequencing studies on the genes involved in CCR showed that the mechanism for co-utilization of the sugars could be different from previously known mechanisms.",

Bacterial synthesis of butanetriol from xylose or arabinose takes place in a pathway that requires four enzymes. To produce butanetriol in plants by expressing bacterial enzymes, we cloned native bacterial or codon optimized synthetic genes under different promoters into a binary vector and stably transformed Arabidopsis plants. Transgenic lines expressing introduced genes were analyzed for the production of butanetriol using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Soil-grown transgenic plants expressing these genes produced up to 20 µg/g of butanetriol. To test if an exogenous supply of pentose sugar precursors would enhance the butanetriol level, transgenic plants were grown in a medium supplemented with either xylose or arabinose and the amount of butanetriol was quantified. Plants expressing synthetic genes in the arabinose pathway showed up to a forty-fold increase in butanetriol levels after arabinose was added to the medium. Transgenic plants expressing either bacterial or synthetic xylose pathways, or the arabinose pathway showed toxicity symptoms when xylose or arabinose was added to the medium, suggesting that a by-product in the pathway or butanetriol affected plant growth. Furthermore, the metabolite profile of plants expressing arabinose and xylose pathways was altered. Our results demonstrate that bacterial pathways that produce butanetriol can be engineered into plants to produce this chemical.

This pathway is composed of an acetolactate synthase, an acetolactate decarboxylase and an acetoin reductase.

Further optimization studies revealed that Synechocystis expresses significant levels of acetolactate synthase endogenously, particularly under conditions of restricted CO2 supply to the cells.

However, the knowledge on the physiological constraints modulating virus production is still scarce and the use of integrated strategies to improve hosts productivity and upstream bioprocess an under-explored territory.In this work, we conducted a functional genomics study, including the transcriptional profiling and central carbon metabolism analysis, following the metabolic changes in the transition ‘parental-to-producer’ of two human cell lines producing recombinant retrovirus. Results were gathered into three comprehensive metabolic maps, providing a broad and integrated overview of gene expression changes for both cell lines. Eight pathways were identified to be recruited in the virus production state: amino acid catabolism, carbohydrate catabolism and integration of the energy metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, glutathione metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, polyamines biosynthesis and lipid metabolism. Their ability to modulate viral titers was experimentally challenged, leading to improved specific productivities of recombinant retrovirus up to 6-fold. Within recruited pathways in the virus production state, we sought for metabolic engineering gene targets in the low producing phenotypes. A mining strategy was used alternative to the traditional approach ‘high vs. low producer’ clonal comparison. Instead, ‘high vs. low producer’ from different genetic backgrounds (i.e. cell origins) were compared. Several genes were identified as limiting in the low-production phenotype, including two enzymes from cholesterol biosynthesis, two enzymes from glutathione biosynthesis and the regulatory machinery of polyamines biosynthesis. This is thus a frontier work, bridging fundamentals to technological research and contributing to enlarge our understanding of enveloped virus production dynamics in mammalian cell hosts.",

Lutein is also valuable in the food and feed industries and is emerging in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical markets. Currently, lutein is obtained at high cost from marigold petals, and synthesis alternatives are thus desirable. Tomato constitutes a promising starting system for production as it naturally accumulates high levels of lycopene. To develop tomato for lutein synthesis, the tomato Red Setter cultivar was transformed with the tomato lycopene ε-cyclase-encoding gene under the control of a constitutive promoter, and the HighDelta (HD) line, characterised by elevated lutein and δ-carotene content in ripe fruits, was selected. HD was crossed to the transgenic HC line and to RSB with the aim of converting all residual fruit δ-carotene to lutein. Fruits of both crosses were enriched in lutein and presented unusual carotenoid profiles. The unique genetic background of the crosses used in this study permitted an unprecedented analysis of the role and regulation of the lycopene cyclase enzymes in tomato.A new defined biochemical index, the relative cyclase activity ratio, was used to discern post-transcriptional regulation of cyclases, and will help in the study of carotenoid biosynthesis in photosynthetic plant species and particularly in those, like tomato, that have been domesticated for the production of food, feed or useful by-products.",

The in planta enzymatic activity and sub-cellular localization of VoGES and LdGES were characterized in stable transformed tobacco and using transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. Transgenic tobacco expressing VoGES or LdGES accumulate geraniol, oxidized geraniol compounds like geranial, geranic acid and hexose conjugates of these compounds to similar levels. Geraniol emission of leaves was lower than that of flowers, which could be related to higher levels of competing geraniol-conjugating activities in leaves. GFP-fusions of the two GES proteins show that VoGES resides (as expected) predominantly in the plastids, while LdGES import into to the plastid is clearly impaired compared to that of VoGES, resulting in both cytosolic and plastidic localization. Geraniol production by VoGES and LdGES in N. benthamiana was nonetheless very similar. Expression of a truncated version of VoGES or LdGES (cytosolic targeting) resulted in the accumulation of 30% less geraniol glycosides than with the plastid targeted VoGES and LdGES, suggesting that the substrate geranyl diphosphate is readily available, both in the plastids as well as in the cytosol. The potential role of GES in the engineering of the TIA pathway in heterologous hosts is discussed.",

     "abstract": "Recombinant mammalian cells are the major hosts for the production of protein therapeutics. In addition to high expression of the product gene, a hyper-producer must also harbor superior phenotypic traits related to metabolism, protein secretion, and growth control. Introduction of genes endowing the relevant hyper-productivity traits is a strategy frequently used to enhance the productivity. Most of such cell engineering efforts have been performed using constitutive expression systems. However, cells respond to various environmental cues and cellular events dynamically according to cellular needs. The use of inducible systems allows for time dependent expression, but requires external manipulation. Ideally, a transgene's expression should be synchronous to the host cell's own rhythm, and at levels appropriate for the objective. To that end, we identified genes with different expression dynamics and intensity ranges using pooled transcriptome data. Their promoters may be used to drive the expression of the transgenes following the desired dynamics. We isolated the promoter of the Thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) gene and demonstrated its capability to drive transgene expression in concert with cell growth. We further employed this Chinese hamster promoter to engineer dynamic expression of the mouse GLUT5 fructose transporter in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, enabling them to utilize sugar according to cellular needs rather than in excess as typically seen in culture. Thus, less lactate was produced, resulting in a better growth rate, prolonged culture duration, and higher product titer. This approach illustrates a novel concept in metabolic engineering which can potentially be used to achieve dynamic control of cellular behaviors for enhanced process characteristics.",

Despite of this economic prospect, the pathway leading to iridoid biosynthesis from geraniol is still unclear. The first geraniol hydroxylation step has been reported to be catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP76B6 from Catharanthus roseus and CYP76C1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. In the present study, an extended functional analysis of CYP76 family members was carried-out to identify the most effective enzyme to be used for pathway reconstruction. This disproved CYP76C1 activity and led to the characterization of CYP76C4 from A. thaliana as a geraniol 9- or 8-hydroxylase. CYP76B6 emerged as a highly specialized multifunctional enzyme catalyzing two sequential oxidation steps leading to the formation of 8-oxogeraniol from geraniol. This dual function was confirmed in planta using a leaf-disc assay. The first step, geraniol hydroxylation, was very efficient and fast enough to outcompete geraniol conjugation in plant tissues. When the enzyme was expressed in leaf tissues, 8-oxogeraniol was converted into further oxidized and/or reduced compounds in the absence of the next enzyme of the iridoid pathway.",

The three species displayed different growth curves and intracellular sucrose accumulation rates in response to NaCl. Synechocystis sp.

The co-overexpression of sps (slr0045), spp (slr0953), and ugp (slr0207) lead to a 2-fold increase in intracellular sucrose accumulation, whereas knockout of ggpS (sll1566) resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in the production of this sugar. When combined, these genetic modifications resulted in a fourfold increase in intracellular sucrose accumulation. To explore methods for optimizing the transport of the intracellular sucrose to the growth medium, the acid-wash technique and the CscB (sucrose permease)-dependent export method were evaluated using Synechocystis sp.

However, the achieved titers are significantly lower as compared to the citric acid production by A. niger. Heterologous expression of cis-aconitate decarboxylase in A. niger leads to the accumulation of small amounts of itaconic acid. Additional expression of aconitase, the second enzyme metabolically linking citric acid and itaconic acid improves productivity. However, proper organelle targeting of the enzymes appears to be an important point to consider. Here we compare the mitochondrial expression with the cytosolic expression of cis-aconitate decarboxylase or aconitase in A. niger. Heterologous expression of both enzymes in the mitochondria doubles the productivity compared to strains which express the enzymes in the cytosol.

We have developed the genetic manipulation in an industrial producer, in which about 15.0 g/l CTC predominated along with 1.2 g/l TC, and discovered that chlorination by ctcP (an FADH2-dependent halogenase gene) is the last inefficient step during CTC biosynthesis. Firstly, the ΔctcP strain accumulated about 18.9 g/l “clean” TC without KBr addition and abolished the production of CTC. Subsequently, CtcP was identified to exhibit a substrate stereo-specificity to absolute TC (4S) rather than TC (4R), with low kcat of 0.51±0.01 min−1, while it could halogenate several TC analogs. Accordingly, we devised a strategy for overexpression of ctcP in S. aureofaciens and improved CTC production to a final titer of 25.9 g/l. We anticipate that our work will provide a biotechnological potential of enzymatic evolution and strain engineering towards new TC derivatives in microorganisms.",

While a large amount of work has been published characterizing promoters for this purpose, less effort has been exerted to elucidate the role of terminators in yeast. In this study, we characterize over 30 terminators for use in metabolic engineering applications in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and determine mRNA half-life changes to be the major cause of the varied protein and transcript expression level. We demonstrate that the difference in transcript level can be over 6.5-fold even for high strength promoters. The influence of terminator selection is magnified when coupled with a low-expression promoter, with a maximum difference in protein expression of 11-fold between an expression-enhancing terminator and the parent plasmid terminator and over 35-fold difference when compared with a no-terminator baseline. This is the first time that terminators have been investigated in the context of multiple promoters spanning orders of magnitude in activity. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of terminator selection for metabolic engineering by using a mutant xylose isomerase gene as a proof-of-concept. Through pairing an expression-enhancing terminator with a low-expression promoter, we were able to achieve the same phenotypic result as with a promoter considerably higher in strength. Moreover, we can further boost the phenotype of the high-strength promoter by pairing it with an expression-enhancing terminator. This work highlights how terminator elements can be used to control metabolic pathways in the same way that promoters are traditionally used in yeast. Together, this work demonstrates that terminators will be an important part of heterologous gene expression and metabolic engineering for yeast in the future.",

However, the glyoxylate shunt, which allows for the synthesis of four-carbon TCA cycle intermediates from acetyl-CoA, has not been found to be reversible to date. As a result, glucose can only be converted to acetyl-CoA via the decarboxylation of the three-carbon molecule pyruvate in heterotrophs. A reverse glyoxylate shunt (rGS) could be extended into a pathway that converts C4 carboxylates into two molecules of acetyl-CoA without loss of CO2. Here, as a proof of concept, we engineered in Escherichia coli such a pathway to convert malate and succinate to oxaloacetate and two molecules of acetyl-CoA. We introduced ATP-coupled heterologous enzymes at the thermodynamically unfavorable steps to drive the pathway in the desired direction. This synthetic pathway in essence reverses the glyoxylate shunt at the expense of ATP.

The reasons for this low bioconversion efficiency were further investigated and several factors potentially hampering industry-compatible valencene bioconversion were identified. One is the toxicity of the products for yeast at concentrations exceeding 100 mg L−1. The second is the accumulation of β-nootkatol in yeast endomembranes. The third is the inhibition of the CYP71D51v2 hydroxylation reaction by the products. Furthermore, we observed that the formation of nootkatone from β-nootkatol is not P450-dependent but catalyzed by a yeast component. Based on these data, we propose new strategies for implementation of a viable P450-based bioconversion process.",

     "abstract": "Most current metabolic engineering applications rely on the inactivation of unwanted reactions and the amplification of product-oriented reactions. All of the biochemical reactions involved with cellular metabolism are tightly coordinated with the electron flow, which depends on the cellular energy status. Thus, the cellular metabolic flux can be controlled either by modulation of the electron flow or the regulation of redox reactions. This study analyzed the genome-wide anaerobic fermentation products of 472 Escherichia coli single gene knockouts, which comprised mainly of dehydrogenases, oxidoreductases, and redox-related proteins. Many metabolic pathways that were located far from anaerobic mixed-acid fermentation significantly affected the profiles of lactic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, and ethanol. Unexpectedly, d-lactate overproduction was determined by a single gene deletion in dehydrogenases (e.g., guaB, pyrD, and serA) involved with nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, the combined knockouts of guaB, pyrD, serA, fnr, arcA, or arcB genes, which are involved with anaerobic transcription regulation, enhanced d-lactate overproduction. These results suggest that the anaerobic fermentation profiles of E. coli can be tuned via the disruption of peripheral dehydrogenases in anaerobic conditions.",

The titers of beauvericins (33.8±1.4 mg/l) and bassianolide (21.7±0.1 mg/l) in the engineered S. cerevisiae BJ5464-NpgA strains were comparable to those in the native producer B. bassiana. Feeding d-hydroxyisovaleric acid (d-Hiv) and the corresponding l-amino acid precursors improved the production of beauvericins and bassianolide. However, the high price of d-Hiv limits its application in large-scale production of these cyclooligomer depsipeptides. Alternatively, we engineered another enzyme, ketoisovalerate reductase (KIVR) from B. bassiana, into S. cerevisiae BJ5464-NpgA for enhanced in situ synthesis of this expensive substrate. Co-expression of BbBEAS and KIVR in the yeast led to significant improvement of the production of beauvericins. The total titer of beauvericin and its congeners (beauvericins A–C) was increased to 61.7±3.0 mg/l and reached 2.6-fold of that in the native producer B. bassiana ATCC 7159. Supplement of l-Val at 10 mM improved the supply of ketoisovalerate, the substrate of KIVR, which consequently further increased the total titer of beauvericins to 105.8±2.1 mg/l. Using this yeast system, we functionally characterized an unknown CODS from Fusarium venenatum NRRL 26139 as a beauvericin synthetase, which was named as FvBEAS.

The goal of this study was to analyze the regulation of plant cell wall precursor metabolism using metabolic flux analysis based on dynamic labeling experiments. Arabidopsis T87 cells were cultured heterotrophically with 13C labeled sucrose. The time course of 13C labeling patterns in cell wall precursors and related sugar phosphates was monitored using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry until steady state labeling was reached. A kinetic model based on mass action reaction mechanisms was developed to simulate the carbon flow in the cell wall synthesis network. The kinetic parameters of the model were determined by fitting the model to the labeling time course data, cell wall composition, and synthesis rates. A metabolic control analysis was performed to predict metabolic regulations that may improve plant biomass composition for biofuel production. Our results describe the routes and rates of carbon flow from sucrose to cell wall precursors. We found that sucrose invertase is responsible for the entry of sucrose into metabolism and UDP-glucose-4-epimerase plays a dominant role in UDP-Gal synthesis in heterotrophic Aradidopsis cells under aerobic conditions.

Here we applied the multiscalar analysis of library enrichments (SCALEs) method and performed a growth selection in an ethanol production system to quantitatively map in parallel all genes in the genome onto ethanol tolerance and production. In order to perform the selection in an ethanol-producing system, we used a previously engineered Escherichia coli ethanol production strain (LW06; ATCC BAA-2466) (Woodruff et al., in press), as the host strain for the multiscalar genomic library analysis (>106 clones for each library of 1, 2, or 4 kb overlapping genomic fragments). By testing individually selected clones, we confirmed that growth selections enriched for clones with both improved ethanol tolerance and production phenotypes. We performed combinatorial testing of the top genes identified (uspC, otsA, otsB) to investigate their ability to confer improved ethanol tolerance or ethanol production. We determined that overexpression of otsA was required for improved tolerance and productivity phenotypes, with the best performing strains showing up to 75% improvement relative to the parent production strain.",

     "abstract": "Synthesis of a desired product can often be achieved via more than one metabolic pathway. Whether naturally evolved or synthetically engineered, these pathways often exhibit specific properties that are suitable for production under distinct conditions and host organisms. Synergy between pathways arises when the underlying pathway characteristics, such as reducing equivalent demand, ATP requirement, intermediate utilization, and cofactor preferences, are complementary to each other. Utilization of such pathways in combination leads to an increased metabolite productivity and/or yield compared to using each pathway alone. This work illustrates the principle of synergy between two different pathways for 1-propanol production in Escherichia coli. A model-guided design based on maximum theoretical yield calculations identified synergy of the native threonine pathway and the heterologous citramalate pathway in terms of production yield across all flux ratios between the two pathways. Characterization of the individual pathways by host gene deletions demonstrates their distinct metabolic characteristics: the necessity of TCA cycle for threonine pathway and the independence of TCA cycle for the citramalate pathway. The two pathways are also complementary in driving force demands. Production experiments verified the synergistic effects predicted by the yield model, in which the platform with dual pathway for 2-ketobutyrate synthesis achieved higher yield (0.15 g/g of glucose) and productivity (0.12 g/L/h) of 1-propanol than individual ones alone: the threonine pathway (0.09 g/g; 0.04 g/L/h) or the citramalate pathway (0.11 g/g; 0.04 g/L/h). Thus, incorporation of synergy into the design principle of metabolic engineering may improve the production yield and rate of the desired compound.",

Since multiple largely unknown parameters determine a particular phenotype, an inverse strategy to select a phenotype of interest can be useful. However, the major constraint for explorative or combinatorial metabolic engineering approaches is the availability of a feasible screening method to select the desired phenotype from a large population in a high-throughput manner. Therefore, a semi-quantitative assay was developed to monitor alcohol production in microtiter cultures of C. acetobutylicum. The applicability of the screening system was evaluated by two examples. First, C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was chemically mutagenized and subjected to high butanol concentrations as a pre-selection step. Screening of the butanol-tolerant population resulted in the identification of mutants with >20% increased butanol production as compared to the wildtype. The second application example was based on a pre-engineered C. acetobutylicum strain with low acetone biosynthetic activity, but concomitantly reduced butanol titer. After chemical mutagenesis, a total of 4390 clones was analyzed and mutants with significantly increased butanol concentrations and similarly low acetone levels as the parental strain were selected. Thus, the suitability of the semi-quantitative screening system was validated, opening up new perspectives for combinatorial strategies to improve solventogenic clostridia and other biofuel microbes.",

In this review, we highlight robust approaches for probing metabolism and addressing metabolically related questions though parallel labeling experiments. In the first part, we provide a brief historical perspective on parallel labeling experiments, from the early metabolic studies when radioisotopes were predominant to present-day applications based on stable-isotopes. We also elaborate on important technical and theoretical advances that have facilitated the transition from radioisotopes to stable-isotopes. In the second part of the review, we focus on parallel labeling experiments for 13C-metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA). Parallel experiments offer several advantages that include: tailoring experiments to resolve specific fluxes with high precision; reducing the length of labeling experiments by introducing multiple entry-points of isotopes; validating biochemical network models; and improving the performance of 13C-MFA in systems where the number of measurements is limited. We conclude by discussing some challenges facing the use of parallel labeling experiments for 13C-MFA and highlight the need to address issues related to biological variability, data integration, and rational tracer selection.",

     "abstract": "The introduction of synthetic devices that provide precise fine-tuning of transgene expression has revolutionized the field of biology. The design and construction of sophisticated and reliable genetic control circuits have increased dramatically in complexity in recent years. The norm when creating such circuits is to program the whole network in a single cell. Although this has been greatly successful, the time will soon come when the capacity of a single cell is no longer adequate. Therefore, synthetic biology-inspired research has started to shift towards a multicellular approach in which specialized cells are constructed and then interconnected, enabling the creation of higher-order networks that do not face the same limitations as single cells. This approach is conceptually appealing in many respects. The fact that overall workload can be easily divided between cells eliminates the problem of limited program capacity of a single cell. Furthermore, engineering of specialized cells will enable a plug-and-play approach in which cells are combined into multicellular consortia depending on the requested task. Recent advances in synthetic biology to implement intercellular communication and multicellular consortia have demonstrated an impressive arsenal of new devices with novel functions that are unprecedented even in engineered single cells.

     "abstract": "Isobutanol is an excellent alternative biofuel. Fermentative production of isobutanol had been realized in several microorganisms by combining branched-chain amino acids synthetic pathway and Ehrlich pathway. In contrast to using plasmid overexpression and inducible promoters, genetically stable Escherichia coli strains for isobutanol production were constructed in this work by integrating essential genes into chromosome. A chromosome-based markerless gene modulation method was then developed for fine-tuning gene expression with multiple regulatory parts to improve isobutanol production. There was also a cofactor imbalance problem for anaerobic isobutanol synthesis. NADPH is the reducing equivalent required for isobutanol production, while the common reducing equivalent under anaerobic condition is NADH. Two strategies were used to modulate expression of transhydrogenase (pntAB) and NAD kinase (yfjB) genes to increase NADPH supply for improving isobutanol production. Plasmid overexpression of pntAB and yfjB genes either individually or in combination had little effect on isobutanol production. In contrast, modulating pntAB and yfjB gene expression in chromosome with multiple regulatory parts identified optimal modulators under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively, and improved isobutanol production. Modulating pntAB gene alone led to 20% and 8% increase of anaerobic isobutanol titer and yield. Although modulating yfjB gene alone had nearly no effect, modulating pntAB and yfjB genes in combination led to 50% and 30% increase of isobutanol titer and yield in comparison with modulating pntAB gene alone. It was also found that increasing pntAB gene expression alone had a threshold for improving anaerobic isobutanol production, while activating NAD kinase could break through this threshold, leading to a yield of 0.92 mol/mol. Our results suggested that transhydrogenase and NAD kinase had a synergistic effect on increasing NADPH supply and improving anaerobic isobutanol production. This strategy will be useful for improving production of target compounds using NADPH as reducing equivalent within their synthetic pathways. In addition, combined activation of PntAB and YfjB led to 28% and 22% increase of aerobic isobutanol titer and yield, resulting in production of 10.8 g/L isobutanol in 24 h with a yield of 0.62 mol/mol.",

Recent advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering have yielded improved strain titers and yields. However, current fermentation strategies often require supplementation of expensive phenylpropanoic precursors in the media and separate evaluation of each strategy in turn as part of the flavonoid pathway, implicitly assuming the modifications are additive. In this study, an Escherichia coli fermentation system was developed to bypass both of these problems. An eight-step pathway, consisting of 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS), chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydratase (CM/PDT), phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), malonate synthetase, and malonate carrier protein, was assembled on four vectors in order to produce the flavonoid precursor (2S)-pinocembrin directly from glucose. Furthermore, a modular metabolic strategy was employed to identify conditions that optimally balance the four pathway modules. Once this metabolic balance was achieved, such strains were capable of producing 40.02 mg/L (2S)-pinocembrin directly from glucose. These results were attained by culturing engineered cells in minimal medium without additional precursor supplementation. The fermentation platform described here paves the way for the development of an economical process for microbial production of flavonoids directly from glucose.",

With the ability to fix CO2 photosynthetically, cyanobacteria have attracted increasing interest as a biosynthesis platform to produce fuels and chemicals from alternative renewable resources. To this end, synthesis metabolic pathways have been constructed and optimized in cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to photosynthetically produce (S)- and (R)-3HB directly from CO2. Both types of 3HB molecules were produced and readily secreted from Synechocystis cells without over-expression of transporters. Additional inactivation of the competing pathway by deleting slr1829 and slr1830 (encoding PHB polymerase) from the Synechocystis genome further promoted the 3HB production. Up to 533.4 mg/L 3HB has been produced after photosynthetic cultivation of the engineered cyanobacterium Synechocystis TABd for 21 days. Further analysis indicated that the phosphate consumption during the photoautrophic growth and the concomitant elevated acetyl-CoA pool acted as a key driving force for 3HB biosynthesis in Synechocystis.

The molecular genetic basis of this trade-off was investigated using a systems biology approach. Transcriptional and metabolic changes resulting from the improvement of galactose utilization were found maintained during growth on glucose. Moreover, glucose repression related genes showed conserved expression patterns during growth on both sugars. Mutations in the RAS2 gene that were identified as beneficial for galactose utilization in evolved mutants exhibited significant correlation with attenuation of glucose utilization. These results indicate that antagonistic pleiotropy is the dominant mechanism in the observed trade-off, and it is likely realized by changes in glucose signaling.",

Since a single miRNA can affect the expression of several genes, the utilization of miRNAs for apoptosis engineering in mammalian cells can be more efficient than the conventional approach of manipulating a single gene. Mmu-miR-466h-5p was previously shown to have a pro-apoptotic role in CHO cells by reducing the expression of several anti-apoptotic genes and its transient inhibition delayed both the activation of Caspase-3/7 and the loss of cell viability. The present study evaluates the effect of stable inhibition of mmu-miR-466h-5p in CHO cells on their ability to resist apoptosis onset and their production properties. The expression of mmu-miR-466h-5p in the engineered anti-miR-466h CHO cell line was significantly lower than in the negative control and the parental CHO cells. These engineered cells reached higher maximum viable cell density and extended viability compared with negative control and parental CHO cells in batch cell cultures which resulted in the 53.8% and 41.6% increase of integral viable cells. The extended viability of anti-miR-466h CHO cells was the result of delayed Caspase-3/7 activation by more than 35 h, and the increased levels of its anti-apoptotic gene targets (smo, stat5a, dad1, birc6, and bcl2l2) to between 2.1- and 12.5-fold compared with the negative control CHO in apoptotic conditions. The expression of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) increased 43% and the cell-specific productivity increased 11% in the stable pools of anti-miR-466h CHO compared with the stable pools of negative control CHO cells.

The fatty acids are important precursors for the production of fuels and chemicals, and its biosynthesis is initiated by the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA which requires acetyl-CoA as key substrate. Herein, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was proposed to be metabolically engineered for cytosol acetyl-CoA enhancement for fatty acid synthesis. By gene disruption strategy, idh1 and idh2 genes involved in citrate turnover in tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) were disrupted and the citrate production level was increased to 4- and 5-times in mutant yeast strains. In order to convert accumulated citrate to cytosol acetyl-CoA, a heterologous ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) was overexpressed in yeast wild type and idh1,2 disrupted strains. The wild type strain expressing acl mainly accumulated saturated fatty acids: C14:0, C16:0 and C18:0 at levels about 20%, 14% and 27%, respectively. Additionally, the idh1,2 disrupted strains expressing acl mainly accumulated unsaturated fatty acids. Specifically in Δidh1 strain expressing acl, 80% increase in C16:1 and 60% increase in C18:1 was detected. In Δidh2 strain expressing acl, 60% increase in C16:1 and 45% increase in C18:1 was detected. In Δidh1/2 strain expressing acl, there was 92% increase in C16:1 and 77% increase in C18:1, respectively.

In the pulse experiments a large oxygen uptake capacity of the cells was observed. The in vivo dynamic responses showed massive reorganization and flexibility (1/100–14-fold change) of extra/intracellular metabolic fluxes, matching with large changes in the concentrations of intracellular metabolites, including reversal of reaction rate for pseudo/near equilibrium reactions. The coupling of metabolome and fluxome could be described by Q-linear kinetics. Remarkably, the three different substrate pulses resulted in a very similar increase in growth rate (0.13–0.3 h−1).

     "abstract": "The 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HPA) bicycle is unique among CO2-fixing systems in that none of its enzymes appear to be affected by oxygen. Moreover, the bicycle includes a number of enzymes that produce novel intermediates of biotechnological interest, and the CO2-fixing steps in this pathway are relatively rapid. We expressed portions of the 3-HPA bicycle in a heterologous organism, E. coli K12. We subdivided the 3-HPA bicycle into four sub-pathways: (1) synthesis of propionyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA, (2) synthesis of succinate from propionyl-CoA, (3) glyoxylate production and regeneration of acetyl-CoA, and (4) assimilation of glyoxylate and propionyl-CoA to form pyruvate and regenerate acetyl-CoA. We expressed the novel enzymes of the 3-HPA bicycle in operon form and used phenotypic tests for activity. Sub-pathway 1 activated a propionate-specific biosensor. Sub-pathway 2, found in non-CO2-fixing bacteria, was reassembled in E. coli using genes from diverse sources. Sub-pathway 3, operating in reverse, generated succinyl-CoA sufficient to rescue a sucAD− double mutant of its diaminopimelic acid (DAP) auxotrophy. Sub-pathway 4 was able to reduce the toxicity of propionate and allow propionate to contribute to cell biomass in a prpC−(2 methylcitrate synthase) mutant strain. These results indicate that all of the sub-pathways of the 3-HPA bicycle can function to some extent in vivo in a heterologous organism, as indicated by growth tests. Overexpression of certain enzymes was deleterious to cell growth, and, in particular, expression of MMC-CoA lyase caused a mucoid phenotype. These results have implications for metabolic engineering and for bacterial evolution through horizontal gene transfer.",

The polyprotein system developed facilitated the simple and efficient co-expression of pathway enzymes requiring different sub-cellular localization in both plants and yeast. The pathway to flavone-C-glucosides comprised a flavanone 2-hydroxylase (F2H), co-expressed with a C-glucosyltransferase (CGT).

These fermentation products could then be readily chemically converted to the respective flavone-C-glucosides. The efficiency of the biosynthesis was optimal when both the F2H and CGT were obtained from the same species (rice).

To this end, we have engineered the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. We first established an expression platform for high expression using an intron-containing translation elongation factor-1α (TEF) promoter and showed that this expression system is capable of increasing gene expression 17-fold over the intronless TEF promoter. We then used this platform for the overexpression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGA1), the final step of the triglyceride (TAG) synthesis pathway, which yielded a 4-fold increase in lipid production over control, to a lipid content of 33.8% of dry cell weight (DCW). We also show that the overexpression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), the first committed step of fatty acid synthesis, increased lipid content 2-fold over control, or 17.9% lipid content. Next we combined the two genes in a tandem gene construct for the simultaneous coexpression of ACC1 and DGA1, which further increased lipid content to 41.4%, demonstrating synergistic effects of ACC1+DGA1 coexpression. The lipid production characteristics of the ACC1+DGA1 transformant were explored in a 2-L bioreactor fermentation, achieving 61.7% lipid content after 120 h.

However, 3-HP production in K. pneumoniae is accompanied with NADH generation, and this always results in large accumulation of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) and lactic acid. In this study, we investigated the potential use of nitrate as an electron acceptor both to regenerate NAD+ and to prevent the formation of byproducts during anaerobic production of 3-HP from glycerol. Nitrate addition could improve NAD+ regeneration, but decreased glycerol flux towards 3-HP production. To divert more glycerol towards 3-HP, a novel recombinant strain K. pneumoniae ΔglpKΔdhaT (puuC) was developed by disrupting the glpK gene, which encodes glycerol kinase, and the dhaT gene, which encodes 1,3-propanediol oxidoreductase. This strain showed improved cellular NAD+ concentrations and a high carbon flux towards 3-HP production. Through anaerobic cultivation in the presence of nitrate, this recombinant strain produced more than 40±3 mM 3-HP with more than 50% yield on glycerol in shake flasks and 250±10 mM 3-HP with approximately 30% yield on glycerol in a fed-batch bioreactor.",

CHO cells were grown in parallel cultures over a period of six days with glucose and glutamine feeding. On days 2 and 5, isotopic tracers were introduced and 13C-labeling of intracellular metabolites was measured by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Metabolites in glycolysis pathway reached isotopic steady state for [1,2-13C]glucose within 1.5 h, and metabolites in the TCA cycle reached isotopic steady state for [U-13C]glutamine within 3 h. Combined analysis of multiple data sets produced detailed flux maps at two key metabolic phases, exponential growth phase (day 2) and early stationary phase (day 5). Flux results revealed significant rewiring of intracellular metabolism in the transition from growth to non-growth, including changes in oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, anaplerosis, amino acid metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis. At the growth phase, de novo fatty acid biosynthesis correlated well with the lipid requirements for cell growth. However, surprisingly, at the non-growth phase the fatty acid biosynthesis flux remained high even though no new lipids were needed for cell growth. Additionally, we identified a discrepancy in the estimated TCA cycle flux obtained using traditional stoichiometric flux balancing and 13C-metabolic flux analysis.

Many process advantages (including lower pH levels) support the production of this molecule in yeast. Here, we present the first heterologous production of muconic acid in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A three-step synthetic, composite pathway comprised of the enzymes dehydroshikimate dehydratase from Podospora anserina, protocatechuic acid decarboxylase from Enterobacter cloacae, and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Candida albicans was imported into yeast. Further genetic modifications guided by metabolic modeling and feedback inhibition mitigation were introduced to increase precursor availability. Specifically, the knockout of ARO3 and overexpression of a feedback-resistant mutant of aro4 reduced feedback inhibition in the shikimate pathway, and the zwf1 deletion and over-expression of TKL1 increased flux of necessary precursors into the pathway. Further balancing of the heterologous enzyme levels led to a final titer of nearly 141 mg/L muconic acid in a shake-flask culture, a value nearly 24-fold higher than the initial strain. Moreover, this strain has the highest titer and second highest yield of any reported shikimate and aromatic amino acid-based molecule in yeast in a simple batch condition. This work collectively demonstrates that yeast has the potential to be a platform for the bioproduction of muconic acid and suggests an area that is ripe for future metabolic engineering efforts.",

Unlike (facultative) anaerobes, P. putida resorts to NADH oxidation via an oxic respiratory chain and completely lacks a true fermentation metabolism. Therefore, it cannot achieve the correct balances of energy and redox couples (i.e., ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD+) that are required to sustain an O2-free lifestyle. To overcome this state of affairs, the acetate kinase (ackA) gene of the facultative anaerobe Escherichia coli and the pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase II (adhB) genes of the aerotolerant Zymomonas mobilis were knocked-in to a wild-type P. putida strain. Biochemical and genetic assays showed that conditional expression of the entire enzyme set allowed the engineered bacteria to adopt an anoxic regime that maintained considerable metabolic activity. The resulting strain was exploited as a host for the heterologous expression of a 1,3-dichloroprop-1-ene degradation pathway recruited from Pseudomonas pavonaceae 170, enabling the recombinants to degrade this recalcitrant chlorinated compound anoxically. These results underscore the value of P. putida as a versatile agent for biotransformations able to function at progressively lower redox statuses.",

Among a set of priority ranked targets, glucose dehydrogenase (encoded by gcd) was predicted as most promising deletion target. The mutant P. putida Δgcd, generated on basis of the computational design, exhibited 100% increased PHA accumulation as compared to the parent wild type, maintained a high specific growth rate and exhibited an almost unaffected gene expression profile, which excluded detrimental side effects of the modification. A second mutant strain, P. putida Δpgl, that lacked 6-phosphogluconolactonase, exhibited a substantially decreased PHA synthesis, as was also predicted by the model. The production potential of P. putida Δgcd was assessed in batch bioreactors. The novel strain showed an increase of the PHA yield (+80%), the PHA titer (+100%) and cellular PHA content (+50%) and revealed almost unaffected growth and diminished by-product formation.

All ethanol-tolerant clones analyzed shared 6% of the overexpressed genes and showed enrichment for transcription regulation-related GO terms. iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis of ethanol-tolerant strains identified upregulation of proteins related to ROS mitigation, fatty acid biosynthesis, and vitamin biosynthesis as compared to the parent strain's ethanol response.

Fermentations by the phosphorolytic strains were greatly improved by using cellodextrin transporters with elevated rates of cellobiose transport. Furthermore under stress conditions, these phosphorolytic strains had higher biomass and ethanol yields compared to hydrolytic strains. These observations suggest that, although cellobiose phosphorolysis has energetic advantages, phosphorolytic strains are limited by the thermodynamics of cellobiose phosphorolysis (ΔG°=+3.6 kJ mol−1).

Escherichia coli and Chlamydia trachomatis share common features in the regulatory mechanism of the biosynthesis of l-tryptophan. The repressor protein TrpR of C. trachomatis regulates the trpRBA operon and the TrpR of E. coli regulates the trpEDCBA operon, both requiring l-tryptophan as a co-repressor. Fusion of these bacterial repressors to the VP16 transactivation domain of Herpes simplex virus creates synthetic transactivators that could bind and activate chimeric promoters, assembled by placing repressor-specific operator modules adjacent to a minimal promoter, in an l-tryptophan-adjustable manner. Combinations of different transactivator and promoter variants from the same or different bacterial species resulted in a multitude of regulatory systems where l-tryptophan regulation properties, background noise, and maximal gene expression levels were significantly diverse. Different l-tryptophan analogues showed diverse regulatory capacity depending on the promoter/transactivator combination. We believe the systems approach to rationally choose promoters, transactivators and inducer molecules, to obtain desired and predefined genetic expression dynamics and control profiles, will significantly advance the design of new regulatory circuits as well as improving already existing ones.",

     "abstract": "In this study, we demonstrate increased lysine production by flux coupling using the industrial work horse bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum, which was mediated by the targeted interruption of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle at the level of succinyl-CoA synthetase. The succinylase branch of the lysine production pathway functions as the bridging reaction to convert succinyl-CoA to succinate in this aerobic bacterium. The mutant C. glutamicum ΔsucCD showed a 60% increase in the yield of lysine when compared to the advanced lysine producer which was used as parent strain. This mutant was highly vital and exhibited only a slightly reduced specific growth rate. Metabolic flux analysis with 13C isotope studies confirmed that the increase in lysine production was mediated by pathway coupling. The novel strain exhibited an exceptional flux profile, which was closer to the optimum performance predicted by in silico pathway analysis than to the large set of lysine-producing strains analyzed thus far. Fluxomics and transcriptomics were applied as further targets for next-level strain engineering to identify the back-up mechanisms that were activated upon deletion of the enzyme in the mutant strain. It seemed likely that the cells partly recruited the glyoxylate shunt as a by-pass route. Additionally, the α-ketoglutarate decarboxylase pathway emerged as the potential compensation mechanism. This novel strategy appears equally promising for Escherichia coli, which is used in the industrial production of lysine, wherein this bacterium synthesizes lysine exclusively by succinyl-CoA activation of pathway intermediates. The channeling of a high flux pathway into a production pathway by pathway coupling is an interesting metabolic engineering strategy that can be explored to optimize bio-production in the future.",

Thus, in contrast to the classic acetone pathway of Clostridium acetobutylicum and related microorganisms which employ a CoA transferase, the new pathway is acetate independent. The genetic background of the host strains was crucial. Only E. coli strains HB101 and WL3 were able to produce acetone via the modified plasmid based pathway, up to 64 mM and 42 mM in 5-ml cultures, respectively. Using glucose fed-batch cultures the concentration could be increased up to 122 mM acetone with HB101 carrying the recombinant plasmid pUC19ayt (thioesterase from H. influenzae). The formation of acetone led to a decreased acetate production by E. coli.",

However, insufficient supply of NAD(P)H for XR and inhibition of xylose uptake by glucose are identified as major constraints for achieving high xylitol productivity. To overcome these problems, we engineered S. cerevisiae capable of converting xylose into xylitol through simultaneous utilization of xylose and cellobiose. An engineered S. cerevisiae (D-10-BT) expressing XR, cellodextrin transporter (cdt-1) and intracellular β-glucosidase (gh1-1) produced xylitol via simultaneous utilization of cellobiose and xylose. The D-10-BT strain exhibited 40% higher volumetric xylitol productivity with co-consumption of cellobiose and xylose compared to sequential utilization of glucose and xylose. Furthermore, the overexpression of S. cerevisiae ALD6, IDP2, or S. stipitis ZWF1 coding for cytosolic NADP+-dependent dehydrogenases increased the intracellular NADPH availability of the D-10-BT strain, which resulted in a 37–63% improvement in xylitol productivity when cellobiose and xylose were co-consumed. These results suggest that co-utilization of cellobiose and xylose can lead to improved xylitol production through enhanced xylose uptake and efficient cofactor regeneration.",

Here, we demonstrate that an Escherichia coli cofactor, tetrahydromonapterin (MH4), can be used as an alternative cofactor for TH in presence of the BH4 regeneration pathway, and tyrosine hydroxylation is performed without over-oxidation. We used this platform for biosynthesis of one of the most powerful antioxidants, hydroxytyrosol. An endogenous aromatic aldehyde oxidase was identified and knocked out to prevent formation of the side product, and this resulted in nearly exclusive production of hydroxytyrosol in engineered E. coli.

This engineered strain (H131-A3) was used to initialize a three-stage process of evolutionary engineering, through first aerobic and anaerobic sequential batch cultivation followed by growth in a xylose-limited chemostat. The evolved strain H131-A3-ALCS displayed significantly increased anaerobic growth rate (0.203±0.006 h−1) and xylose consumption rate (1.866 g g−1 h−1) along with high ethanol conversion yield (0.41 g/g). These figures exceed by a significant margin any other performance metrics on xylose utilization and ethanol production by S. cerevisiae reported to-date. Further inverse metabolic engineering based on functional complementation suggested that efficient xylose assimilation is attributed, in part, to the elevated expression level of xylose isomerase, which was accomplished through the multiple-copy integration of XYLA in the chromosome of the evolved strain.",

     "abstract": "The production of the chemical solvents acetone and butanol by the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum was one of the first large-scale industrial processes to be developed, and in the first part of the last century ranked second in importance only to ethanol production. After a steep decline in its industrial use, there has been a recent resurgence of interest in the acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) fermentation process, with a particular emphasis on butanol production. In order to generate strains suitable for efficient use on an industrial scale, metabolic engineering is required to alter the AB ratio in favour of butanol, and eradicate the production of unwanted products of fermentation. Using ClosTron technology, a large-scale targeted mutagenesis in C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was carried out, generating a set of 10 mutants, defective in alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (adhE1, adhE2), butanol dehydrogenases A and B (bdhA, bdhB), phosphotransbutyrylase (ptb), acetate kinase (ack), acetoacetate decarboxylase (adc), CoA transferase (ctfA/ctfB), and a previously uncharacterised putative alcohol dehydrogenase (CAP0059). However, inactivation of the main hydrogenase (hydA) and thiolase (thl) could not be achieved. Constructing such a series of mutants is paramount for the acquisition of information on the mechanism of solvent production in this organism, and the subsequent development of industrial solvent producing strains. Unexpectedly, bdhA and bdhB mutants did not affect solvent production, whereas inactivation of the previously uncharacterised gene CAP0059 resulted in increased acetone, butanol, and ethanol formation. Other mutants showed predicted phenotypes, including a lack of acetone formation (adc, ctfA, and ctfB mutants), an inability to take up acids (ctfA and ctfB mutants), and a much reduced acetate formation (ack mutant). The adhE1 mutant in particular produced very little solvents, demonstrating that this gene was indeed the main contributor to ethanol and butanol formation under the standard batch culture conditions employed in this study. All phenotypic changes observed could be reversed by genetic complementation, with exception of those seen for the ptb mutant. This mutant produced around 100 mM ethanol, no acetone and very little (7 mM) butanol. The genome of the ptb mutant was therefore re-sequenced, together with its parent strain (ATCC 824 wild type), and shown to possess a frameshift mutation in the thl gene, which perfectly explained the observed phenotype. This finding reinforces the need for mutant complementation and Southern Blot analysis (to confirm single ClosTron insertions), which should be obligatory in all further ClosTron applications.",

     "abstract": "The baculovirus/insect cell system is widely used for recombinant protein production, but it is suboptimal for recombinant glycoprotein production because it does not provide sialylation, which is an essential feature of many glycoprotein biologics. This problem has been addressed by metabolic engineering, which has extended endogenous insect cell N-glycosylation pathways and enabled glycoprotein sialylation by baculovirus/insect cell systems. However, further improvement is needed because even the most extensively engineered baculovirus/insect cell systems require media supplementation with N-acetylmannosamine, an expensive sialic acid precursor, for efficient recombinant glycoprotein sialylation. Our solution to this problem focused on E. coli N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate 2′-epimerase (GNPE), which normally functions in bacterial sialic acid degradation. Considering that insect cells have the product, but not the substrate for this enzyme, we hypothesized that GNPE might drive the reverse reaction in these cells, thereby initiating sialic acid biosynthesis in the absence of media supplementation. We tested this hypothesis by isolating transgenic insect cells expressing E. coli GNPE together with a suite of mammalian genes needed for N-glycoprotein sialylation. Various assays showed that these cells efficiently produced sialic acid, CMP-sialic acid, and sialylated recombinant N-glycoproteins even in growth media without N-acetylmannosamine. Thus, this study demonstrated that a eukaryotic recombinant protein production platform can be glycoengineered with a bacterial gene, that a bacterial enzyme which normally functions in sialic acid degradation can be used to initiate sialic acid biosynthesis, and that insect cells expressing this enzyme can produce sialylated N-glycoproteins without N-acetylmannosamine supplementation, which will reduce production costs in glycoengineered baculovirus/insect cell systems.",

The mechanism by which FadR enhanced fatty acid yield was studied by whole-genome transcriptional analysis (microarray) and targeted proteomics. Overexpression of FadR led to transcriptional changes for many genes, including genes involved in fatty acid pathways. The biggest transcriptional changes in fatty acid pathway genes included fabB, fabF, and accA.

In this study, we propose a metabolite valve to mitigate these issues by dynamically tuning endogenous processes to balance the demands of cell health and pathway efficiency. A control node of glucose utilization, glucokinase (Glk), was exogenously manipulated through either engineered antisense RNA or an inverting gene circuit. Using these techniques, we were able to directly control glycolytic flux, reducing the specific growth rate of engineered Escherichia coli by up to 50% without altering final biomass accumulation. This modulation was accompanied by successful redirection of glucose into a model pathway leading to an increase in the pathway yield and reduced carbon waste to acetate. This work represents one of the first examples of the dynamic redirection of glucose away from central carbon metabolism and enables the creation of novel, efficient intracellular pathways with glucose used directly as a substrate.",

     "abstract": "Increasing demands for petroleum have stimulated sustainable ways to produce chemicals and biofuels. Specifically, fatty acids of varying chain lengths (C6–C16) naturally synthesized in many organisms are promising starting points for the catalytic production of industrial chemicals and diesel-like biofuels. However, bio-production of fatty acids from plants and other microbial production hosts relies heavily on manipulating tightly regulated fatty acid biosynthetic pathways. In addition, precursors for fatty acids are used along other central metabolic pathways for the production of amino acids and biomass, which further complicates the engineering of microbial hosts for higher yields. Here, we demonstrate an iterative metabolic engineering effort that integrates computationally driven predictions and metabolic flux analysis techniques to meet this challenge. The OptForce procedure was used for suggesting and prioritizing genetic manipulations that overproduce fatty acids of different chain lengths from C6 to C16 starting with wild-type E. coli. We identified some common but mostly chain-specific genetic interventions alluding to the possibility of fine-tuning overproduction for specific fatty acid chain lengths. In accordance with the OptForce prioritization of interventions, fabZ and acyl-ACP thioesterase were upregulated and fadD was deleted to arrive at a strain that produces 1.70 g/L and 0.14 g fatty acid/g glucose (∼39% maximum theoretical yield) of C14–16 fatty acids in minimal M9 medium.

     "abstract": "As a precursor of bioengineered heparin, heparosan is currently produced from Escherichia coli K5, which is pathogenic bacteria potentially causing urinary tract infection. Thus, it would be advantageous to develop an alternative source of heparosan from a non-pathogeneic strain. In this work we reported the biosynthesis of heparosan via the metabolic engineering of non-pathogenic E. coli BL21 as a production host. Four genes, KfiA, KfiB, KfiC and KfiD, encoding enzymes for the biosynthesis of heparosan in E. coli K5, were cloned into inducible plasmids pETDuet-1 and pRSFDuet-1 and further transformed into E. coli BL21, yielding six recombinant strains as follows: sA, sC, sAC, sABC, sACD and sABCD. The single expression of KfiA (sA) or KfiC (sC) in E. coli BL21 did not produce heparosan, while the co-expression of KfiA and KfiC (sAC) could produce 63 mg/L heparosan in shake flask. The strain sABC and sACD could produce 100 and 120 mg/L heparosan, respectively, indicating that the expression of KfiB or KfiD was beneficial for heparosan production. The strain sABCD could produce 334 mg/L heparosan in shake flask and 652 mg/L heparosan in 3-L batch bioreactor. The heparosan yield was further increased to 1.88 g/L in a dissolved oxygen-stat fed-batch culture in 3-L bioreactor. As revealed by the nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, the chemical structure of heparosan from recombinant E. coli BL21 and E. coli K5 was identical. The weight average molecular weight of heparosan from E. coli K5, sAC, sABC, sACD, and sABCD was 51.67, 39.63, 91.47, 64.51, and 118.30 kDa, respectively. This work provides a viable process for the production of heparosan as a precursor of bioengineered heparin from a safer bacteria strain.",

     "abstract": "13C-metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is a widely used method for measuring intracellular metabolic fluxes in living cells. 13C MFA relies on several key assumptions: (1) the assumed metabolic network model is complete, in that it accounts for all significant enzymatic and transport reactions; (2) 13C-labeling measurements are accurate and precise; and (3) enzymes and transporters do not discriminate between 12C- and 13C-labeled metabolites. In this study, we tested these inherent assumptions of 13C MFA for wild-type E. coli by parallel labeling experiments with [U-13C]glucose as tracer. Cells were grown in six parallel cultures in custom-constructed mini-bioreactors, starting from the same inoculum, on medium containing different mixtures of natural glucose and fully labeled [U-13C]glucose, ranging from 0% to 100% [U-13C]glucose. Macroscopic growth characteristics of E. coli showed no observable kinetic isotope effect. The cells grew equally well on natural glucose, 100% [U-13C]glucose, and mixtures thereof. 13C MFA was then used to determine intracellular metabolic fluxes for several metabolic network models: an initial network model from literature; and extended network models that accounted for potential dilution effects of isotopic labeling. The initial network model did not give statistically acceptable fits and produced inconsistent flux results for the parallel labeling experiments. In contrast, an extended network model that accounted for dilution of intracellular CO2 by exchange with extracellular CO2 produced statistically acceptable fits, and the estimated metabolic fluxes were consistent for the parallel cultures. This study illustrates the importance of model validation for 13C MFA. We show that an incomplete network model can produce statistically unacceptable fits, as determined by a chi-square test for goodness-of-fit, and return biased metabolic fluxes. The validated metabolic network model for E. coli from this study can be used in future investigations for unbiased metabolic flux measurements.",

Sequence analysis showed that there was only a single amino acid substitution (Phe383Val) in the feedback-resistant threonine dehydratase, and there were three mutated amino acids (Pro176Ser, Asp426Glu, and Leu575Trp) in the big subunit of feedback-resistant acetohydroxy acid synthase. The mutated threonine dehydratase over-expressed in E. coli not only showed completely resistance to l-isoleucine inhibition, but also showed enhanced activity. The mutated acetohydroxy acid synthase over-expressed in E. coli showed more resistance to l-isoleucine inhibition than the wild type. Over-expression of the feedback-resistant threonine dehydratase or acetohydroxy acid synthase in C. glutamicum JHI3-156 led to increase of l-isoleucine production; co-expression of them in C. glutamicum JHI3-156 led to 131.7% increase in flask cultivation, and could produce 30.7 g/L l-isoleucine in 72-h fed-batch fermentation.

A genetic switch is required to precisely separate growth from production and to simplify the fermentation process. The ldhA promoter, which encodes the fermentative d-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the lactate producer Escherichia coli CICIM B0013-070 (ack-pta pps pflB dld poxB adhE frdA), was replaced with the λ pR and pL promoters (as a genetic switch) using genomic recombination and the thermo-controllable strain B0013–070B (B0013-070, ldhAp::kan-cIts857-pR–pL), which could produce two-fold higher LDH activity at 42 °C than the B0013-070 strain, was created. When the genetic switch was turned off at 33 °C, strain B0013-070B produced 10% more biomass aerobically than strain B0013-070 and produced only trace levels of lactate which could reduce the growth inhibition caused by oxygen insufficiency in large scale fermentation. However, 42 °C is the most efficient temperature for switching on lactate production. The volumetric productivity of B0013-070B improved by 9% compared to that of strain B0013-070 when it was grown aerobically at 33 °C with a short thermo-induction at 42 °C and then switched to the production phase at 42 °C.

     "abstract": "Toxicity of products or feedstock components poses a challenge in the biocatalyst-based production of fuels and chemicals. The genetic determinants that are involved in increased resistance to an inhibitor form the adaptive landscape for the phenotype; so in order to engineer more robust biocatalysts, a better understanding of the adaptive landscape is required. Here, we used an adaptive laboratory evolution method called visualizing evolution in real time (VERT) to help map out part of the adaptive landscape of Escherichia coli tolerance to the biofuel n-butanol. VERT enables identification of adaptive events (population expansions triggered by adaptive mutants) via visualization of the relative proportions of different fluorescently-labeled cells. Knowledge of the occurrence of adaptive events allows for a more systematic isolation of adaptive mutants while simultaneously reducing the number of missed adaptive mutants (and the underlying adaptive mechanisms) that result from clonal interference during the course of in vitro evolution. Based on the evolutionary dynamics observed, clonal interference was found to play a significant role in shaping the population structure of E. coli during exposure to n-butanol, and VERT helped to facilitate the isolation of adaptive mutants from the population. We further combined adaptive laboratory evolution with genome shuffling to significantly enhance the desired n-butanol tolerance phenotype. Subsequent transcriptome analysis of the isolated adaptive mutants revealed different mechanisms of n-butanol resistance in different lineages. In one fluorescently-marked subpopulation, members of the Fur regulon were upregulated; which was not observed in the other subpopulation. In addition, genome sequencing of several adaptive mutants revealed the genetic basis for some of the observed transcriptome profiles. We further elucidated the potential role of the iron-related gene in n-butanol tolerance via overexpression and deletion studies and hypothesized that the upregulation of the iron-related genes indirectly led to modifications in the outer membrane, which contributed to enhanced n-butanol tolerance.",

Expression of these genes resulted in a 3- to 10-fold increase in the yields of different mammalian GPCRs.

A translational coupling cassette was designed to encode a mRNA sequence that forms a secondary structure in the absence of translation and contains the translational start sequence of a detectable response gene. The translational coupling method was successfully tested with fluorescent proteins and antibiotic resistance markers. Only when the target gene was fully translated was the response observed. Further characterization demonstrated that translational coupling functions at both low and high levels of expression and that the response signal is proportional to the amount of target gene product.

Engineering this yeast for a practicable fermentation of xylose will therefore improve the economics of bioconversion for the production of fuels and chemicals such as ethanol. One of the most widely employed strategies is to express XYL1, XYL2, and XYL3 genes derived from Scheffersomyces stipitis (formerly Pichia stiptis) in S. cerevisiae. However, the resulting engineered strains have been reported to exhibit large variations in xylitol accumulation and ethanol yields, generating many hypotheses and arguments for elucidating these phenomena. Here we demonstrate that low expression levels of the XYL2 gene, coding for xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH), is a major bottleneck in efficient xylose fermentation. Through an inverse metabolic engineering approach using a genomic library of S. cerevisiae, XYL2 was identified as an overexpression target for improving xylose metabolism. Specifically, we performed serial subculture experiments after transforming a genomic library of wild type S. cerevisiae into an engineered strain harboring integrated copies of XYL1, XYL2 and XYL3. Interestingly, the isolated plasmids from efficient xylose-fermenting transformants contained XYL2. This suggests that the integrated XYL2 migrated into a multi-copy plasmid through homologous recombination. It was also found that additional overexpression of XYL2 under the control of strong constitutive promoters in a xylose-fermenting strain not only reduced xylitol accumulation, but also increased ethanol yields. As the expression levels of XYL2 increased, the ethanol yields gradually improved from 0.1 to 0.3 g ethanol/g xylose, while the xylitol yields significantly decreased from 0.4 to 0.1 g xylitol/g xylose. These results suggest that strong expression of XYL2 is a necessary condition for developing efficient xylose-fermenting strains.",

To illustrate the effect of our ECMs-based constraints, a Flux Variability Analysis approach was applied to a previously published metabolic network involving the main pathways in the metabolism of glucose. The addition of our ECMs-based constraints substantially reduced the under-determination resulting from a standard application of Flux Variability Analysis, which shows a clear progress over the state of the art. In addition, our approach is adjusted to deal with combinatorial explosion of ECMs in genome-scale metabolic networks. This extension was applied to infer the maximum biosynthetic capacity of non-essential amino acids in human metabolism. Finally, as linearity is the hallmark of our approach, its importance is discussed at a methodological, computational and theoretical level and illustrated with a practical application in the field of Isotope Labeling Experiments.",

AtoSCDAEB regulon, comprising the AtoSC system and the atoDAEB operon, regulates the short-chain fatty acids catabolism. We report here, that AtoSC up-regulates the high-molecular weight PHB biosynthesis, in recombinant phaCAB+E. coli, with the Cupriavidus necator phaCAB operon. PHB accumulation was maximized upon the acetoacetate-mediated induction of AtoSC, under glucose 1% w/v, resulting in a yield of 1.73 g/l with a biopolymer content of 64.5% w/w. The deletion of the atoSC locus, in the ΔatoSC strains, resulted in a 5 fold reduction of PHB accumulation, which was restored by the extrachromosomal introduction of the AtoSC system. The deletion of the atoDAEB operon triggered a significant decrease in PHB synthesis in ΔatoDAEB strains. However, the acetoacetate-induced AtoSC system in those strains increased PHB to 1.55 g/l, while AtoC expression increased PHB to 1.4 g/l upon acetoacetate. The complementation of the ΔatoDAEB phenotype was achieved by the extrachromosomal introduction of the atoSCDAEB regulon. The individual inhibition of β-oxidation and mainly fatty-acid biosynthesis pathways by acrylic acid or cerulenin respectively, reduced PHB biosynthesis. Under those conditions the introduction of the atoSC locus or the atoSCDAEB regulon was capable to up-regulate the biopolymer accumulation. The concurrent inhibition of both the fatty acids metabolic pathways eliminated PHB production. PHB up-regulation in phaCAB+E. coli, by AtoSC signaling through atoDAEB operon and its participation in the fatty acids metabolism interplay, provide additional perceptions of AtoSC critical involvement in E. coli regulatory processes towards the biotechnologically improved polyhydroxyalkanoates biosynthesis.",

     "abstract": "Controlling the amounts of redox cofactors to manipulate metabolic fluxes is emerging as a useful approach to optimizing byproduct yields in yeast biotechnological processes. Redox cofactors are extensively interconnected metabolites, so predicting metabolite patterns is challenging and requires in-depth knowledge of how the metabolic network responds to a redox perturbation. Our aim was to analyze comprehensively the metabolic consequences of increased cytosolic NADPH oxidation during yeast fermentation. Using a genetic device based on the overexpression of a modified 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase catalyzing the NADPH-dependent reduction of acetoin into 2,3-butanediol, we increased the NADPH demand to between 8 and 40-fold the anabolic demand. We developed (i) a dedicated constraint-based model of yeast fermentation and (ii) a constraint-based modeling method based on the dynamical analysis of mass distribution to quantify the in vivo contribution of pathways producing NADPH to the maintenance of redox homeostasis. We report that yeast responds to NADPH oxidation through a gradual increase in the flux through the PP and acetate pathways, providing 80% and 20% of the NADPH demand, respectively. However, for the highest NADPH demand, the model reveals a saturation of the PP pathway and predicts an exchange between NADH and NADPH in the cytosol that may be mediated by the glycerol–DHA futile cycle. We also reveal the contribution of mitochondrial shuttles, resulting in a net production of NADH in the cytosol, to fine-tune the NADH/NAD+ balance. This systems level study helps elucidate the physiological adaptation of yeast to NADPH perturbation. Our findings emphasize the robustness of yeast to alterations in NADPH metabolism and highlight the role of the glycerol–DHA cycle as a redox valve, providing additional NADPH from NADH under conditions of very high demand.",

     "abstract": "Microbial biosynthesis of fatty acid like chemicals from renewable carbon sources has attracted significant attention in recent years. Free fatty acids can be used as precursors for the production of fuels or chemicals. Wild type E. coli strains produce fatty acids mainly for the biosynthesis of lipids and cell membranes and do not accumulate free fatty acids as intermediates in lipid biosynthesis. However, free fatty acids can be produced by breaking the fatty acid elongation through the overexpression of an acyl-ACP thioesterase. Since acetyl-CoA might be an important factor for fatty acid synthesis (acetate formation pathways are the main competitive pathways in consuming acetyl-CoA or pyruvate, a precursor of acetyl-CoA), and the long chain fatty acid CoA-ligase (FadD) plays a pivotal role in the transport and activation of exogenous fatty acids prior to their subsequent degradation, we examined the composition and the secretion of the free fatty acids in four different strains including the wild type MG1655, a mutant strain with inactivation of the fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway (fadD mutant (ML103)), and mutant strains with inactivation of the two major acetate production pathways (an ack-pta (acetate kinase/phosphotransacetylase), poxB (pyruvate oxidase) double mutant (ML112)) and a fadD, ack-pta, poxB triple mutant (ML115). The engineered E. coli cells expressing acyl-ACP thioesterase with glucose yield is higher than 40% of theoretical yield. Compared to MG1655(pXZ18) and ML103(pXZ18), acetate forming pathway deletion strains such as ML112(pXZ18) and ML115(pXZ18) produced similar quantity of total free fatty acids, which indicated that acetyl-CoA availability does not appear to be limiting factor for fatty acid production in these strains. However, these strains did show significant differences in the composition of free fatty acids. Different from MG1655(pXZ18) and ML103(pXZ18), acetate formation pathway deletion strains such as ML112(pXZ18) and ML115(pXZ18) produced similar level of C14, C16:1 and C16 free fatty acids, and the free fatty acid compositions of both strains did not change significantly with time. In addition, the strains bearing the fadD mutation showed significant differences in the quantities of free fatty acids found in the broth.

Several canonical genes encoding ceramide synthase (encoded by PcLAG1 and PcLAF1), alkaline ceramidase (PcYXC1) and sphingolipid C-4-hydroxylase(PcSYR2), as well as structural genes for dihydroceramide Δ4-desaturase (PcDES1) and sphingolipid Δ8-desaturase (PcSLD1) were identified, indicating that P. ciferrii would be capable of synthesizing desaturated sphingoid bases, a property not ubiquitously found in yeasts.In order to convert the phytosphingosine-producing P. ciferrii wildtype into a strain capable of producing predominantly sphinganine, Syringomycin E-resistant mutants were isolated. A stable mutant almost exclusively producing high levels of acetylated sphinganine was obtained and used as the base strain for further metabolic engineering. A metabolic pathway required for the three-step conversion of sphinganine to sphingosine was implemented in the sphinganine producing P. ciferrii strain and subsequently enhanced by screening for the appropriate heterologous enzymes, improvement of gene expression and codon optimization. These combined efforts led to a strain capable of producing 240 mg L−1 triacetyl sphingosine in shake flask, with tri- and diacetyl sphinganine being the main by-products. Lab-scale fermentation of this strain resulted in production of up to 890 mg kg−1 triacetyl sphingosine. A third by-product was unequivocally identified as triacetyl sphingadienine. It could be shown that inactivation of the SLD1 gene in P. ciferrii efficiently suppresses triacetyl sphingadienine formation. Further improvement of the described P. ciferrii strains will enable a biotechnological route to produce sphinganine and sphingosine for cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications.",

In glucose-limited chemostat cultures of P. chrysogenum, up to 88% of the consumed adipic acid was not recovered in cephalosporin-related products, but used as an additional carbon and energy source for growth. This low efficiency of side-chain precursor incorporation provides an economic incentive for studying and engineering the metabolism of adipic acid in P. chrysogenum. Chemostat-based transcriptome analysis in the presence and absence of adipic acid confirmed that adipic acid metabolism in this fungus occurs via β-oxidation. A set of 52 adipate-responsive genes included six putative genes for acyl-CoA oxidases and dehydrogenases, enzymes responsible for the first step of β-oxidation. Subcellular localization of the differentially expressed acyl-CoA oxidases and dehydrogenases revealed that the oxidases were exclusively targeted to peroxisomes, while the dehydrogenases were found either in peroxisomes or in mitochondria. Deletion of the genes encoding the peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase Pc20g01800 and the mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenase Pc20g07920 resulted in a 1.6- and 3.7-fold increase in the production of the semi-synthetic cephalosporin intermediate adipoyl-6-APA, respectively. The deletion strains also showed reduced adipate consumption compared to the reference strain, indicating that engineering of the first step of β-oxidation successfully redirected a larger fraction of adipic acid towards cephalosporin biosynthesis.",

However, most successes of metabolic engineering have been confined to over-producing natively synthesized metabolites in E. coli and S. cerevisiae. A major reason for this development has been the descent of metabolic engineering, particularly secondary metabolic engineering, to a collection of demonstrations rather than a systematic practice with generalizable tools. Synthetic biology, a more recent development, faces similar criticisms. Herein, we attempt to lay down a framework around which bioreaction engineering can systematize itself just like chemical reaction engineering. Central to this undertaking is a new approach to engineering secondary metabolism known as ‘multivariate modular metabolic engineering’ (MMME), whose novelty lies in its assessment and elimination of regulatory and pathway bottlenecks by re-defining the metabolic network as a collection of distinct modules. After introducing the core principles of MMME, we shall then present a number of recent developments in secondary metabolic engineering that could potentially serve as its facilitators. It is hoped that the ever-declining costs of de novo gene synthesis; the improved use of bioinformatic tools to mine, sort and analyze biological data; and the increasing sensitivity and sophistication of investigational tools will make the maturation of microbial metabolic engineering an autocatalytic process. Encouraged by these advances, research groups across the world would take up the challenge of secondary metabolite production in simple hosts with renewed vigor, thereby adding to the range of products synthesized using metabolic engineering.",

An emerging strategy to combat this problem is to spatially organize pathway enzymes into multi-protein complexes, where high local concentrations of enzymes and metabolites may enhance flux and limit problematic interactions with the cellular milieu. Co-localizing enzymes using synthetic scaffolds has improved titers for multiple pathways. While lacking physical diffusion barriers, scaffolded systems could concentrate intermediates locally through a mechanism analogous to naturally occurring microdomains. A more direct strategy for compartmentalizing pathway components would be to encapsulate them within protein shells. Several classes of shells have been loaded with exogenous proteins and expressed successfully in industrial hosts. A critical challenge for achieving ideal pathway compartmentalization with protein shells will likely be evolving pores to selectively limit intermediate diffusion. Eventually, these tools should enhance our ability to rationally design metabolic pathways.",

     "abstract": "Cell-free synthetic biology is emerging as a powerful approach aimed to understand, harness, and expand the capabilities of natural biological systems without using intact cells. Cell-free systems bypass cell walls and remove genetic regulation to enable direct access to the inner workings of the cell. The unprecedented level of control and freedom of design, relative to in vivo systems, has inspired the rapid development of engineering foundations for cell-free systems in recent years. These efforts have led to programmed circuits, spatially organized pathways, co-activated catalytic ensembles, rational optimization of synthetic multi-enzyme pathways, and linear scalability from the micro-liter to the 100-liter scale. It is now clear that cell-free systems offer a versatile test-bed for understanding why nature's designs work the way they do and also for enabling biosynthetic routes to novel chemicals, sustainable fuels, and new classes of tunable materials. While challenges remain, the emergence of cell-free systems is poised to open the way to novel products that until now have been impractical, if not impossible, to produce by other means.",

     "abstract": "The advent of genetic engineering has elevated our level of comprehension of cellular processes and functions. A natural progression of these findings is determining not only how these processes function within individual cells but also within a community. Bacterial cells monitor the conditions and microorganisms in their vicinity by producing, releasing and sensing chemical-signaling molecules. When a specific cell-density threshold is reached, a quorum is perceived, gene expression profiles are altered and the community orchestrates activities that are more effective en masse. This communication mechanism, in the language of autoinducers (AI), is referred to as quorum sensing (QS). It has become increasingly evident that while scientists attempt to decipher the intricacies of cellular communication and quorum sensing networks, we must remain conscious of the broader context of how a cell may identify itself in the environment and how this also impacts QS. Importantly, these phenomena span time and length scales by several orders in magnitude. Though the revelation of small RNAs, as both sensing and regulatory elements participating in the quorum sensing cascade, has connected new pieces of the puzzle, it has also added a new tier of uncertainty. The complexity of quorum sensing networks makes resolution of its diverse mechanisms difficult. The ability to design simpler networks with defined, more predictable or even “modular” elements will help elucidate these actions. Because it embraces innovative concepts of biological design accommodating the many length and time scales at play, synthetic biology serves as one of the most promising platforms for describing QS phenomena as well as enabling novel implementation strategies for biotechnological application.",

     "abstract": "Metabolic engineering is the field of introducing genetic changes in organisms so as to modify their function towards synthesizing new products of high impact to society. However, engineered cells frequently have impaired growth rates thus seriously limiting the rate at which such products are made. The problem is attributable to inadequate understanding of how a metabolic network functions in a dynamic sense. Predictions of mutant strain behavior in the past have been based on steady state theories such as flux balance analysis (FBA), minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), and regulatory on/off minimization (ROOM). Such predictions are restricted to product yields and cannot address productivity, which is of focal interest to applications. We demonstrate that our framework (Song and Ramkrishna, 2010, Song and Ramkrishna, 2011), based on a “cybernetic” view of metabolic systems, makes predictions of the dynamic behavior of mutant strains of Escherichia coli from a limited amount of data obtained from the wild-type. Dynamic frameworks must necessarily address the issue of metabolic regulation, which the cybernetic approach does by postulating that metabolism is an optimal dynamic response of the organism to the environment in driving reactions towards ensuring survival. The predictions made in this paper are without parallel in the literature and lay the foundation for rational metabolic engineering.",

     "abstract": "Heparin is the most widely used pharmaceutical to control blood coagulation in modern medicine. A health crisis that took place in 2008 led to a demand for production of heparin from non-animal sources. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, commonly used mammalian host cells for production of foreign pharmaceutical proteins in the biopharmaceutical industry, are capable of producing heparan sulfate (HS), a related polysaccharide naturally. Since heparin and HS share the same biosynthetic pathway, we hypothesized that heparin could be produced in CHO cells by metabolic engineering. Based on the expression of endogenous enzymes in the HS/heparin pathways of CHO-S cells, human N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST2) and mouse heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 1 (Hs3st1) genes were transfected sequentially into CHO host cells growing in suspension culture. Transfectants were screened using quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. Out of 120 clones expressing NDST2 and Hs3st1, 2 clones, Dual-3 and Dual-29, were selected for further analysis. An antithrombin III (ATIII) binding assay using flow cytometry, designed to recognize a key sugar structure characteristic of heparin, indicated that Hs3st1 transfection was capable of increasing ATIII binding. An anti-factor Xa assay, which affords a measure of anticoagulant activity, showed a significant increase in activity in the dual-expressing cell lines. Disaccharide analysis of the engineered HS showed a substantial increase in N-sulfo groups, but did not show a pattern consistent with pharmacological heparin, suggesting that further balancing the expression of transgenes with the expression levels of endogenous enzymes involved in HS/heparin biosynthesis might be necessary.",

Here, for the first time a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain capable of producing high levels of α-santalene, the precursor of a commercially interesting compound, was constructed through a rationally designed metabolic engineering approach. Optimal sesquiterpene production was obtained by modulating the expression of one of the key metabolic steps of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, squalene synthase (Erg9). To couple ERG9 expression to glucose concentration its promoter was replaced by the HXT1 promoter. In a second approach, the HXT2 promoter was used to express an ERG9 antisense construct. Using the HXT1 promoter to control ERG9 expression, it was possible to divert the carbon flux from sterol synthesis towards α-santalene improving the productivity by 3.4 fold. Combining this approach together with the overexpression of a truncated form of 3-hydroxyl-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and deletion of lipid phosphate phosphatase encoded by LPP1 led to a strain with a productivity of 0.18 mg/gDCW h. The titer was further increased by deleting DPP1 encoding a second FPP consuming pyrophosphate phosphatase yielding a final productivity and titer, respectively, of 0.21 mg/gDCW h and 92 mg/l of α-santalene.",

In this study, we report that over-expression of the SM protein encoding genes SEC1 and SLY1, improves the protein secretion in S. cerevisiae. Engineering Sec1p, the SM protein that is involved in vesicle trafficking from Golgi to cell membrane, improves the secretion of heterologous proteins human insulin precursor and α-amylase, and also the secretion of an endogenous protein invertase. Enhancing Sly1p, the SM protein regulating the vesicle fusion from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi, increases α-amylase production only.

Batch cultivations of α1-antitrypsin (A1AT) producing AGE1.HN cells were carried out in media with initial ammonia concentrations ranging from 0 mM to 5 mM. Growth, A1AT production, metabolite dynamics and finally metabolic fluxes calculated by metabolite balancing were compared. Growth and A1AT production decreased with increasing ammonia concentration. The maximum A1AT concentration decreased from 0.63 g/l to 0.51 g/l. Central energy metabolism remained relatively unaffected exhibiting only slightly increased glycolytic flux at high initial ammonia concentration in the medium. However, the amino acid metabolism was significantly changed. Fluxes through transaminases involved in amino acid degradation were reduced concurrently with a reduced uptake of amino acids. On the other hand fluxes through transaminases working in the direction of amino acid synthesis, i.e., alanine and phosphoserine, were increased leading to increased storage of excess nitrogen in extracellular alanine and serine. Glutamate dehydrogenase flux was reversed increasingly fixing free ammonia with increasing ammonia concentration. Urea production additionally observed was associated with arginine uptake by the cells and did not increase at high ammonia stress. It was therefore not used as nitrogen sink to remove excess ammonia. The results indicate that the AGE1.HN cell line can adapt to ammonia concentrations usually present during the cultivation process to a large extent by changing metabolism but with slightly reduced A1AT production and growth.",

     "abstract": "Fedbatch culture is the prevalent cell cultivation method in producing protein therapeutics. A metabolic shift to lactate consumption in late stage of cultivation has been shown to extend the culture viability and increase product concentrations. To better understand the factors, which trigger metabolic shift we performed transcriptome and metabolic flux analysis on a fedbatch culture of mouse myeloma cell line (NS0) and developed a mechanistic kinetic model for energy metabolism. Experimental observation indicates that the shift to lactate consumption occurs upon the cessation of rapid growth and under conditions of low glycolysis flux and high extracellular lactate concentrations. Although the transition is accompanied by a general down regulation of enzymes in energy metabolism, that alone was insufficient to elicit a metabolic shift. High lactate level has been reported to exert an inhibitory effect on glycolysis enzyme phosphofructokinase; model simulation suggests that a high lactate level can contribute to reduced glycolytic flux as well as providing a driving force for its conversion to pyruvate. The transcriptome data indicate that moderate alteration in the transcript levels of AKT1 and P53 signaling pathways genes occurs in the late stage of culture. These signaling pathways are known to regulate glycolytic activity. Model simulations further suggest that AKT1 signaling plays a key role in facilitating lactate consumption. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that lactate consumption in fedbatch culture is an outcome of reduced glycolysis flux, which is a product of lactate inhibition and regulatory action of signaling pathway caused by reduced growth rate.",

     "abstract": "Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is a powerful technique for elucidating in vivo fluxes in microbial and mammalian systems. A key step in 13C-MFA is the selection of an appropriate isotopic tracer to observe fluxes in a proposed network model. Despite the importance of MFA in metabolic engineering and beyond, current approaches for tracer experiment design are still largely based on trial-and-error. The lack of a rational methodology for selecting isotopic tracers prevents MFA from achieving its full potential. Here, we introduce a new technique for tracer experiment design based on the concept of elementary metabolite unit (EMU) basis vectors. We demonstrate that any metabolite in a network model can be expressed as a linear combination of so-called EMU basis vectors, where the corresponding coefficients indicate the fractional contribution of the EMU basis vector to the product metabolite. The strength of this approach is the decoupling of substrate labeling, i.e. the EMU basis vectors, from the dependence on free fluxes, i.e. the coefficients. In this work, we demonstrate that flux observability inherently depends on the number of independent EMU basis vectors and the sensitivities of coefficients with respect to free fluxes. Specifically, the number of independent EMU basis vectors places hard limits on how many free fluxes can be determined in a model. This constraint is used as a guide for selecting feasible substrate labeling. In three example models, we demonstrate that by maximizing the number of independent EMU basis vectors the observability of a system is improved. Inspection of sensitivities of coefficients with respect to free fluxes provides additional constraints for proper selection of tracers. The present contribution provides a fresh perspective on an important topic in metabolic engineering, and gives practical guidelines and design principles for a priori selection of isotopic tracers for 13C-MFA studies.",

To address this issue we applied a genetic algorithm to optimize mixtures of 13C-labeled glucose and glutamine for use in MFA.

Sphingolipids are important ingredients in cosmetic applications as they play important roles in human skin. Our work aimed to improve TAPS production by genetic engineering of P. ciferrii. In the first step we improved precursor availability by blocking degradation of L-serine, which is condensed with palmitoyl-CoA by serine palmitoyltransferase in the first committed step of sphingolipid biosynthesis. Successive deletion of two genes, SHM1 and SHM2, encoding L-serine hydroxymethyltransferases, and of CHA1 encoding L-serine deaminase, resulted in a strain producing 65 mg(TAPS) g−1(cdw), which is a threefold increase in comparison with the parental strain. Attempts to increase the metabolic flux into and through the L-serine biosynthesis pathway did not improve TAPS production. However, genetic engineering of the sphingolipid pathway further increased secretion of TAPS. Blocking of sphingoid long-chain base phosphorylation by deletion of the LCB kinase gene PcLCB4 resulted in a further increase in TAPS production by 78% and significant secretion of the direct precursor of phytosphingosine, sphinganin, in a triacetylated form (TriASa). Overproduction of two serine palmitoyltransferase subunits, Lcb1 and Lcb2, together with a deletion of the gene ORM12 encoding a putative negative regulator of sphingolipid synthesis resulted in a strain producing 178 mg(TAPS) g−1(cdw). Additional overproduction of the C4-hydroxylase Syr2 converting sphinganine to phytosphingosine reduced TriASa production and further improved TAPS production. The final recombinant P. ciferrii strain produced up to 199 mg(TAPS) g−1(cdw) with a maximal production rate of 8.42 mg×OD600nm−1 h−1 and a titer of about 2 g L−1, and should be applicable for industrial TAPS production.",

In this article, a novel type of cell-cell flocculation induced by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase 1 (TPS1) promoter was presented. The linear cassette HO–PTPS1–FLO1SPSC01–KanMX4–HO was constructed to transform the non-flocculating industrial yeast S. cerevisiae 4126 by chromosome integration to obtain a new flocculating yeast strain, ZLH01, whose flocculation was induced by ethanol produced during fermentation. The experimental results illustrated that flocculation of ZLH01 was triggered by 3% (v/v) ethanol and enhanced as ethanol concentration increased till complete flocculation was achieved at ethanol concentration of 8% (v/v). Real time PCR analysis confirmed that the expression of FLO1SPSC01 was dependent on ethanol concentration. The growth and ethanol fermentation of ZLH01 were improved significantly, compared with the constitutive flocculating yeast BHL01 engineered with the same FLO gene but directed by the constitutive 3-phosphoglycerate kinase promoter PGK1, particularly under high temperature conditions. These characteristics make the engineered yeast more suitable for ethanol production from industrial substrates under high gravity and temperature conditions.

Transplastomic plants containing the MEV pathway genes accumulated higher levels of mevalonate, carotenoids, squalene, sterols, and triacyglycerols than control plants. This is the first time an entire eukaryotic pathway with six enzymes has been transplastomically expressed in plants. Thus, we have developed an important tool to redirect metabolic fluxes in the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway and a viable multigene strategy for engineering metabolism in plants.",

High seed-specific expression of a Stokesia laevis epoxygenase (SlEPX) in soybeans only results in 3–7% epoxide levels.

SlEPX-transgenic seeds showed a 2–5% reduction in total oil content and protein levels of 30.9–51.4%. To address these pleiotrophic effects of SlEPX expression on other traits, transgenic soybeans were developed to co-express SlEPX and DGAT (diacylglycerol acyltransferase) genes (VgDGAT1 & 2) isolated from Vernonia galamensis, a high accumulator of epoxy fatty acids. These side effects of SlEPX expression were largely overcome in the DGAT co-expressing soybeans. Total oil and protein contents were restored to the levels in non-transgenic soybeans, indicating that both VgDGAT1 and VgDGAT2 could complement the disrupted phenotypes caused by over-expression of an epoxygenase in soybean seeds.",

In batch culture on a minimal glucose medium, the recombinant strain A. niger SKAn1015, expressing the fructofuranosidase encoding suc1 gene secreted 45 U/mL of the target enzyme, whereas the parent wild type SKANip8 did not exhibit production. The production of the recombinant enzyme induced a significant change of in vivo fluxes in central carbon metabolism, as assessed by 13C metabolic flux ratio analysis. Most notably, the flux redistribution enabled an elevated supply of NADPH via activation of the cytosolic pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and mitochondrial malic enzyme, whereas the flux through energy generating TCA cycle was reduced. In addition, the overall possible flux space of fructofuranosidase producing A. niger was investigated in silico by elementary flux mode analysis. This provided theoretical flux distributions for multiple scenarios with differing production capacities. Subsequently, the measured flux changes linked to improved production performance were projected into the in silico flux space. This provided a quantitative evaluation of the achieved optimization and a priority ranked target list for further strain engineering. Interestingly, the metabolism was shifted largely towards the optimum flux pattern by sole expression of the recombinant enzyme, which seems an inherent attractive property of A. niger. Selected fluxes, however, changed contrary to the predicted optimum and thus revealed novel targets—including reactions linked to NADPH metabolism and gluconate formation.",

Here, we report an anhydrotetracycline-inducible gene expression system for solvent-producing bacterium C. acetobutylicum. This system consists of a functional chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene promoter containing tet operators (tetO), Pthl promoter (thiolase gene promoter from C. acetobutylicum) controlling TetR repressor expression cassette, and the chemical inducer anhydrotetracycline (aTc). The optimized system, designated as pGusA2-2tetO1, allows gene regulation in an inducer aTc concentration-dependent way, with an inducibility of over two orders of magnitude. The stringency of TetR repression supports the introduction of the genes encoding counterselective marker into C. acetobutylicum, which can be used to increase the mutant screening efficiency. This aTc-inducible gene expression system will thus increase the genetic manipulation capability for engineering C. acetobutylicum.",

Metabolic engineering was performed using Streptomyces and Sophora flavescens prenyltransferase genes to produce prenylated polyphenols in transgenic legume plants. Three Streptomyces genes, NphB, SCO7190, and NovQ, whose gene products have broad substrate specificity, were overexpressed in a model legume, Lotus japonicus, in the cytosol, plastids or mitochondria with modification to induce the protein localization. Two plant genes, N8DT and G6DT, from Sophora flavescens whose gene products show narrow substrate specificity were also overexpressed in Lotus japonicus. Prenylated polyphenols were undetectable in these plants; however, supplementation of a flavonoid substrate resulted in the production of prenylated polyphenols such as 7-O-geranylgenistein, 6-dimethylallylnaringenin, 6-dimethylallylgenistein, 8-dimethylallynaringenin, and 6-dimethylallylgenistein in transgenic plants. Although transformants with the native NovQ did not produce prenylated polyphenols, modification of its codon usage led to the production of 6-dimethylallylnaringenin and 6-dimethylallylgenistein in transformants following naringenin supplementation. Prenylated polyphenols were not produced in mitochondrial-targeted transformants even under substrate feeding. SCO7190 was also expressed in soybean, and dimethylallylapigenin and dimethylallyldaidzein were produced by supplementing naringenin. This study demonstrated the potential for the production of novel prenylated polyphenols in transgenic plants. In particular, the enzymatic properties of prenyltransferases seemed to be altered in transgenic plants in a host species-dependent manner.",

     "abstract": "Diacetyl causes an unwanted buttery off-flavor in lager beer. It is spontaneously generated from α-acetolactate, an intermediate of yeast's valine biosynthesis released during the main beer fermentation. Green lager beer has to undergo a maturation process lasting two to three weeks in order to reduce the diacetyl level below its taste-threshold. Therefore, a reduction of yeast's α-acetolactate/diacetyl formation without negatively affecting other brewing relevant traits has been a long-term demand of brewing industry. Previous attempts to reduce diacetyl production by either traditional approaches or rational genetic engineering had different shortcomings. Here, three lager yeast strains with marked differences in diacetyl production were studied with regard to gene copy numbers as well as mRNA abundances under conditions relevant to industrial brewing. Evaluation of data for the genes directly involved in the valine biosynthetic pathway revealed a low expression level of Sc-ILV6 as a potential molecular determinant for low diacetyl formation. This hypothesis was verified by disrupting the two copies of Sc-ILV6 in a commercially used lager brewers' yeast strain, which resulted in 65% reduction of diacetyl concentration in green beer. The Sc-ILV6 deletions did not have any perceptible impact on beer taste. To our knowledge, this has been the first study exploiting natural diversity of lager brewers' yeast strains for strain optimization.",

To demonstrate that a metabolic network evolves towards such state we have carried out adaptive evolution experiments with Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum operating with a reduced metabolic functionality based on a reduced set of elementary modes. In such reduced metabolic network metabolic fluxes can be conveniently computed from the measured metabolite secretion pattern. Over a time span of 300 generations the specific growth rate of the strain continuously increased together with a continuous increase in the rate of entropy production. We show that the rate of entropy production asymptotically approaches the maximum entropy production rate predicted from the state when the usage probability of individual elementary modes is distributed according to the Boltzmann distribution.

     "abstract": "Sucrose is a major carbon source for industrial bioethanol production by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In yeasts, two modes of sucrose metabolism occur: (i) extracellular hydrolysis by invertase, followed by uptake and metabolism of glucose and fructose, and (ii) uptake via sucrose-proton symport followed by intracellular hydrolysis and metabolism. Although alternative start codons in the SUC2 gene enable synthesis of extracellular and intracellular invertase isoforms, sucrose hydrolysis in S. cerevisiae predominantly occurs extracellularly. In anaerobic cultures, intracellular hydrolysis theoretically enables a 9% higher ethanol yield than extracellular hydrolysis, due to energy costs of sucrose-proton symport. This prediction was tested by engineering the promoter and 5′ coding sequences of SUC2, resulting in predominant (94%) cytosolic localization of invertase. In anaerobic sucrose-limited chemostats, this iSUC2-strain showed an only 4% increased ethanol yield and high residual sucrose concentrations indicated suboptimal sucrose-transport kinetics. To improve sucrose-uptake affinity, it was subjected to 90 generations of laboratory evolution in anaerobic, sucrose-limited chemostat cultivation, resulting in a 20-fold decrease of residual sucrose concentrations and a 10-fold increase of the sucrose-transport capacity. A single-cell isolate showed an 11% higher ethanol yield on sucrose in chemostat cultures than an isogenic SUC2 reference strain, while transcriptome analysis revealed elevated expression of AGT1, encoding a disaccharide-proton symporter, and other maltose-related genes. After deletion of both copies of the duplicated AGT1, growth characteristics reverted to that of the unevolved SUC2 and iSUC2 strains.

As a proof-of-concept, the metabolic effect of the ubiCA gene knockout and coenzyme Q1 supplementation were characterized, and the metabolic profiles of the experimental strains showed clear correlations with coenzyme Q1 concentrations.

     "abstract": "Microbial biosynthesis of fatty acid-like chemicals from renewable carbon sources has attracted significant attention in recent years. Free fatty acids can be used as precursors for the production of fuels or chemicals. Free fatty acids can be produced by introducing an acyl–acyl carrier protein thioesterase gene into Escherichia coli. The presence of the acyl-ACP thioesterase will break the fatty acid elongation cycle and release free fatty acid. Depending on their sequence similarity and substrate specificity, class FatA thioesterase is active on unsaturated acyl-ACPs and class FatB prefers saturated acyl group. Different acyl-ACP thioesterases have different degrees of chain length specificity. Although some of these enzymes have been characterized from a number of sources, information on their ability to produce free fatty acid in microbial cells has not been extensively examined until recently. In this study, we examined the effect of the overexpression of acyl-ACP thioesterase genes from Diploknema butyracea, Gossypium hirsutum, Ricinus communis and Jatropha curcas on free fatty acid production. In particular, we are interested in studying the effect of different acyl-ACP thioesterase on the quantities and compositions of free fatty acid produced by an E. coli strain ML103 carrying these constructs. It is shown that the accumulation of free fatty acid depends on the acyl-ACP thioesterase used. The strain carrying the acyl-ACP thioesterase gene from D. butyracea produced approximately 0.2 g/L of free fatty acid while the strains carrying the acyl-ACP thioesterase genes from R. communis and J. curcas produced the most free fatty acid at a high level of more than 2.0 g/L at 48 h. These two strains accumulated three major straight chain free fatty acids, C14, C16:1 and C16 at levels about 40%, 35% and 20%, respectively.",

Here, we report the identification and characterization of the cytochalasin gene cluster from A. clavatus NRRL 1. As a producer of cytochalasin E and K, the genome of A. clavatus was analyzed and the ∼30 kb ccs gene cluster was identified based on the presence of a polyketide synthase–nonribosomal peptide synthetases (PKS–NRPS) and a putative Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO). Deletion of the central PKS–NRPS gene, ccsA, abolished the production of cytochalasin E and K, confirming the association between the natural products and the gene cluster. Based on bioinformatic analysis, a putative biosynthetic pathway is proposed. Furthermore, overexpression of the pathway specific regulator ccsR elevated the titer of cytochalasin E from 25 mg/L to 175 mg/L. Our results not only shed light on the biosynthesis of cytochalasins, but also provided genetic tools for increasing and engineering the production.",

In addition, by over-expressing genes coding for rate-limiting enzymes of the aromatic pathway, biosynthesis of the CoQ10 precursor para-hydroxybenzoate (PHB) was increased. The production of isoprenoid precursors of CoQ10 was also improved by the heterologous expression of a synthetic mevalonate operon, which permits the conversion of exogenously supplied mevalonate to farnesyl diphosphate. The over-expression of these precursors in the CoQ10-producing E. coli strain resulted in an increase in CoQ10 content, as well as in the accumulation of an intermediate of the ubiquinone pathway, decaprenylphenol (10P-Ph). In addition, the over-expression of a PHB decaprenyl transferase (UbiA) encoded by a gene from Erythrobacter sp. NAP1 was introduced to direct the flux of DPP and PHB towards the ubiquinone pathway. This further increased CoQ10 content in engineered E. coli, but decreased the accumulation of 10P-Ph. Finally, we report that the combined over-production of isoprenoid precursors and over-expression of UbiA results in the decaprenylation of para-aminobenzoate, a biosynthetic precursor of folate, which is structurally similar to PHB.",

     "abstract": "Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is a key tool for measuring in vivo metabolic fluxes in systems at metabolic steady state. Here, we present a new method for dynamic metabolic flux analysis (DMFA) of systems that are not at metabolic steady state. The advantages of our DMFA method are: (1) time-series of metabolite concentration data can be applied directly for estimating dynamic fluxes, making data smoothing and estimation of average extracellular rates unnecessary; (2) flux estimation is achieved without integration of ODEs, or iterations; (3) characteristic metabolic phases in the fermentation data are identified automatically by the algorithm, rather than selected manually/arbitrarily. We demonstrate the application of the new DMFA framework in three example systems. First, we evaluated the performance of DMFA in a simple three-reaction model in terms of accuracy, precision and flux observability. Next, we analyzed a commercial glucose-limited fed-batch process for 1,3-propanediol production. The DMFA method accurately captured the dynamic behavior of the fed-batch fermentation and identified characteristic metabolic phases. Lastly, we demonstrate that DMFA can be used without any assumed metabolic network model for data reconciliation and detection of gross measurement errors using carbon and electron balances as constraints.",

     "abstract": "Control of polyene macrolide production in Streptomyces natalensis is mediated by the PAS–LuxR transcriptional activator PimM. Expression of target genes in this strain is positively regulated by binding of the regulator to 14-nucleotide sites showing dyad symmetry, and overlapping the -35 element of each promoter. These sequences have been found in the upstream regions of genes belonging to different polyene biosynthetic gene clusters. All the sequences in the amphotericin, nystatin, and filipin clusters were cloned and the binding of PimM to all of them has been shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The precise binding regions were investigated by DNaseI protection studies. Results indicated that PAS–luxR regulators share the same regulatory pattern in different polyene-producing strains, these genes being responsible for polyketide chain construction, and when available, the genes for sugar dehydration and attachment, and the ABC transporters, the targets for regulation. Information content analysis of the 24 sequences protected in target promoters was used to refine the information-based model of the binding site. This site now spans 16 nucleotides and adjusts to the consensus CTVGGGAWWTCCCBAG. Gene complementation of S. natalensis ΔpimM with a single copy of heterologous regulators of the PAS/LuxR class integrated into the chromosome, such as amphRIV, nysRIV, or pteF, restored antifungal production, thus proving the functional conservation of these regulators. Introduction of a single copy of pimM into the amphotericin producing strain Streptomyces nodosus, or into the filipin producing strain S. avermitilis, boosted the production of both polyenes, thus indicating that the expression of the PAS–LuxR regulator constitutes a bottleneck in the biosynthesis of the antifungal, and also that these regulators are fully exchangeable. This work is the first report of a general mechanism regulating polyene production.",

Over-expression of glucosyltransferase ValG in TL01 did not increase the efficiency of glycosylation.

An ugp gene was cloned from S. hygroscopicus 5008 and verified to code for Ugp. In TL01 with an extra copy of ugp, the transcription of ugp was increased for 1.5 times, and Ugp activity was increased by 100%. Moreover, 22 g/L validamycin A and 2.5 g/L validoxylamine A were produced, and the validamycin A/validoxylamine A ratio was increased from 3.15 in TL01 to 5.75.

     "abstract": "The oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica can accumulate up to 38% of its dry weight (DW) as lipids. Factors involved in lipid accumulation, particularly triglycerides, are not well identified. Using different mutations in the glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) shuttle pathway (Δgut2 affecting the anabolic dehydrogenase or overexpressing GPD1 affecting the catabolic dehydrogenase), we were able to modulate G3P concentration. We show that in a Po1d genetic background, GPD1 overexpression, GUT2 inactivation or both mutations together result in 1.5, 2.9, and 5.6-fold respective increases in the level of G3P leading to an increase of triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation. Moreover, our results indicate that each strain with an increased concentration of G3P, also presented a decreased concentration of glycerol. Analysis of the different genes involved in glycerol metabolism indicated that Y. lipolytica does not possess a gene for glycerol-3-phosphatase. These findings suggest that Y. lipolytica has a modified and unique metabolism of glycerol that is dedicated to G3P synthesis (and also to TAG synthesis) which may contribute to its oleaginous character. Furthermore, coupling the G3P shuttle disorders to a deficient β-oxidation pathway (by inactiving POX1-6 or MFE1 genes) increased TAG and free fatty acids content. Finally, we obtained strains that accumulated up to 65–75% of their DW as lipid. Transcriptional analysis in these strains, revealed that the high levels of lipids resulted from over-expression of genes involved in TAG synthesis (SCT1, encoding a sn-1 acyltransferase; and DGA1, encoding an acylCoA diacylglycerol acyltransferase) and the repression of genes involved in the degradation of TAG (TGL3 and TGL4, encoding triacylglycerol lipases). These findings indicate that TAG synthesis is limited by the availability of G3P and fatty acids, and that the expression of genes involved in TAG homeostasis is regulated by the G3P shuttle and the β-oxidation pathway. Finally, the synergistic contribution of acyltransferase gene expression to G3P synthesis is required for high levels of TAG synthesis and lipid accumulation in Y. lipolytica.",

Similarly overexpression of the xylB gene in a XI strain increased the aerobic growth rate on xylose by 21%. In contrast to the in silico predictions, the aerobic growth also increased 24% when the xylose transporter gene GXF1 from Candida intermedia was overexpressed together with xylB in the XI strain.

Simultaneous heterologous overexpression of a eugenol (EGS) and isoeugenol synthase (IGS) gene in the same cultivated strawberry fruits boosted the formation of eugenol, isoeugenol, and the related phenylpropenes chavicol and anol to concentrations orders of magnitude greater than their odor thresholds. The results show that Fragaria×ananassa still bears a phenylpropene biosynthetic pathway but the carbon flux is primarily directed to the formation of pigments. Thus, partial restoration of wild strawberry flavor in cultivated varieties is feasible by diverting the flavonoid pathway to phenylpropene synthesis through metabolic engineering.",

Overexpression of the cefR gene decreased (up to 60%) penicillin N secretion, saving precursors and resulting in increased cephalosporin C production.

Here we demonstrate how, through the de novo design and development of a novel metabolic pathway, styrene can alternatively be synthesized from renewable substrates such as glucose. The conversion of endogenously synthesized l-phenylalanine to styrene was achieved by the co-expression of phenylalanine ammonia lyase and trans-cinnamate decarboxylase. Candidate isoenzymes for each step were screened from bacterial, yeast, and plant genetic sources. Finally, over-expression of PAL2 from Arabidopsis thaliana and FDC1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (originally classified as ferulate decarboxylase) in an l-phenylalanine over-producing Escherichia coli host led to the accumulation of up to 260 mg/L in shake flask cultures. Achievable titers already approach the styrene toxicity threshold (determined as ∼300 mg/L). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of microbial styrene production from sustainable feedstocks.",

Using a cholesterol-producing yeast strain, we show that solute transporters for tryptophan and arginine are functional, whereas the export of weak organic acids via Pdr12p, a multi-drug resistance family member, is not. The latter reveals a sterol function that is probably dependent upon a precise sterol structure. We present a series of novel yeast strains with different sterol compositions as valuable tools to characterize sterol function and use them to refine the sterol requirements for Pdr12p.

However, malonyl-CoA naturally synthesized in microorganisms is consumed for the production of fatty acids and phospholipids leaving only a small amount available for the production of other metabolic targets in recombinant biosynthesis. Here we present an integrated computational and experimental approach aimed at improving the intracellular availability of malonyl-CoA in Escherichia coli. We used a customized version of the recently developed OptForce methodology to predict a minimal set of genetic interventions that guarantee a prespecified yield of malonyl-CoA in E. coli strain BL21 Star™. In order to validate the model predictions, we have successfully constructed an E. coli recombinant strain that exhibits a 4-fold increase in the levels of intracellular malonyl-CoA compared to the wild type strain. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of this E. coli strain for the production of plant-specific secondary metabolites naringenin (474 mg/L) with the highest yield ever achieved in a lab-scale fermentation process. Combined effect of the genetic interventions was found to be synergistic based on a developed analysis method that correlates genetic modification to cell phenotype, specifically the identified knockout targets (ΔfumC and ΔsucC) and overexpression targets (ACC, PGK, GAPD and PDH) can cooperatively force carbon flux towards malonyl-CoA. The presented strategy can also be readily expanded for the production of other malonyl-CoA-derived compounds like polyketides and biofuels.",

     "abstract": "Expression of foreign pathways often results in suboptimal performance due to unintended factors such as introduction of toxic metabolites, cofactor imbalances or poor expression of pathway components. In this study we report a 120% improvement in the production of the isoprenoid-derived sesquiterpene, amorphadiene, produced by an engineered strain of Escherichia coli developed to express the native seven-gene mevalonate pathway from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Martin et al. 2003). This substantial improvement was made by varying only a single component of the pathway (HMG-CoA reductase) and subsequent host optimization to improve cofactor availability. We characterized and tested five variant HMG-CoA reductases obtained from publicly available genome databases with differing kinetic properties and cofactor requirements. The results of our in vitro and in vivo analyses of these enzymes implicate substrate inhibition of mevalonate kinase as an important factor in optimization of the engineered mevalonate pathway. Consequently, the NADH-dependent HMG-CoA reductase from Delftia acidovorans, which appeared to have the optimal kinetic parameters to balance HMG-CoA levels below the cellular toxicity threshold of E. coli and those of mevalonate below inhibitory concentrations for mevalonate kinase, was identified as the best producer for amorphadiene (54% improvement over the native pathway enzyme, resulting in 2.5 mM or 520 mg/L of amorphadiene after 48 h). We further enhanced performance of the strain bearing the D. acidovorans HMG-CoA reductase by increasing the intracellular levels of its preferred cofactor (NADH) using a NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii, along with formate supplementation. This resulted in an overall improvement of the system by 120% resulting in 3.5 mM or 700 mg/L amorphadiene after 48 h of fermentation. This comprehensive study incorporated analysis of several key parameters for metabolic design such as in vitro and in vivo kinetic performance of variant enzymes, intracellular levels of protein expression, in-pathway substrate inhibition and cofactor management to enable the observed improvements.

However, relatively little is known about the metabolism of CHO cells in cell culture. In this work, metabolism of CHO cells was studied at the growth phase and early stationary phase using isotopic tracers and mass spectrometry. CHO cells were grown in fed-batch culture over a period of six days. On days 2 and 4, [1,2-13C] glucose was introduced and the labeling of intracellular metabolites was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) at 6, 12 and 24 h following the introduction of tracer. Intracellular metabolic fluxes were quantified from measured extracellular rates and 13C-labeling dynamics of intracellular metabolites using non-stationary 13C-metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA). The flux results revealed significant rewiring of intracellular metabolic fluxes in the transition from growth to non-growth, including changes in energy metabolism, redox metabolism, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and anaplerosis. At the exponential phase, CHO cell metabolism was characterized by a high flux of glycolysis from glucose to lactate, anaplerosis from pyruvate to oxaloacetate and from glutamate to α-ketoglutarate, and cataplerosis though malic enzyme. At the stationary phase, the flux map was characterized by a reduced flux of glycolysis, net lactate uptake, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway flux, and reduced rate of anaplerosis. The fluxes of pyruvate dehydrogenase and TCA cycle were similar at the exponential and stationary phase. The results presented here provide a solid foundation for future studies of CHO cell metabolism for applications such as cell line development and medium optimization for high-titer production of recombinant proteins.",

The nitrate assimilation pathway is a potential competing pathway that may reduce the electron flow to the hydrogenase and thereby limit hydrogen production. To improve H2 production, the nitrate assimilation pathway was disrupted by genetic engineering to redirect the electron flow towards the Hox-hydrogenase. Mutant strains disrupted in either nitrate reductase (ΔnarB) or nitrite reductase (ΔnirA) or both nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase (ΔnarB:ΔnirA) were constructed and tested for their ability to produce hydrogen. H2 production and Hox-hydrogenase activities in all the mutant strains were higher than those in wild-type. Highest H2 production was observed in the ΔnarB:ΔnirA strain. Small changes were observed for Hox-hydrogenase enzyme activities and only minor changes in transcript levels of hoxH and hoxY were not correlated with H2 production. The results suggest that the high rate of H2 production observed in the ΔnarB:ΔnirA strain of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 is the result of redirecting the electron supply from the nitrate assimilation pathway, through genetic engineering, towards the Hox-hydrogenase.",

In C. glutamicum DAP-3c, a tailor-made producer, the diaminopentane forming enzyme, lysine decarboxylase, was inhibited in vivo by its end-product, suggesting a potential bottleneck at the level of the export. The previously proposed lysine exporter lysE was shown not to be involved in diaminopentane export. Its deletion did not reduce diaminopentane secretion and could therefore be exploited to completely eliminate the export of lysine, an undesired by-product. Genome-wide transcription profiling revealed the up-regulation of 35 candidate genes as response to diaminopentane overproduction, including several transporters. The highest expression increase (2.6-fold) was observed for a permease, encoded by cg2893. Targeted gene deletion in the producer resulted in a 90% reduced diaminopentane secretion. Genome-based overexpression of the exporter, however, revealed a 20% increased yield, a 75% reduced formation of the undesired by-product N-acetyl-diaminopentane and a substantially higher viability, reflected by increased specific rates for growth, glucose uptake and product formation. Similarly, deletion of cg2894, TetR type repressor neighboring the permease gene, resulted in improved production properties. The discovery and amplification of the permease, as presented here, displays a key contribution towards superior C. glutamicum strains for production of the platform chemical diaminopentane. The exact function of the permease remained unclear. Its genetic modification had pronounced effects on various intracellular pools of the biosynthetic pathway, which did not allow a final conclusion on its physiological role, although a direct contribution to diaminopentane export appears possible.",

Here we demonstrated that over-expression of Bacillus subtilis endoglucanase BsCel5 enabled B. subtilis to grow on solid cellulosic materials as the sole carbon source for the first time. Furthermore, two-round directed evolution was conducted to increase specific activity of BsCel5 on regenerated amorphous cellulose (RAC) and enhance its expression/secretion level in B. subtilis. To increase lactate yield, the alpha-acetolactate synthase gene (alsS) in the 2,3-butanediol pathway was knocked out. In the chemically defined minimal M9/RAC medium, B. subtilis XZ7(pBscel5-MT2C) strain (ΔalsS), which expressed a BsCel5 mutant MT2C, was able to hydrolyze RAC with cellulose digestibility of 74% and produced about 3.1 g/L lactate with a yield of 60% of the theoretical maximum. When 0.1% (w/v) yeast extract was added in the M9/RAC medium, cellulose digestibility and lactate yield were enhanced to 92% and 63% of the theoretical maximum, respectively.

Although significant strides have been made recently in improving strain titers and yields, current fermentation strategies suffer from two major drawbacks—(1) the requirement for expensive phenylpropanoic precursors supplemented into the media and (2) the need for two separate media formulations for biomass/protein generation and flavonoid production. In this study, we detail the construction of a series of strains capable of bypassing both of these problems. A four-step heterologous pathway consisting of the enzymes tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), and chalcone isomerase (CHI) was assembled within two engineered l-tyrosine Escherichia coli overproducers in order to enable the production of the main flavonoid precursor naringenin directly from glucose. During the course of this investigation, we discovered that extensive optimization of both enzyme sources and relative gene expression levels was required to achieve high quantities of both p-coumaric acid and naringenin accumulation. Once this metabolic balance was achieved, however, such strains were found to be capable of producing 29 mg/l naringenin from glucose and up to 84 mg/l naringenin with the addition of the fatty acid enzyme inhibitor, cerulenin. These results were obtained through cultivation of E. coli in a single minimal medium formulation without additional precursor supplementation, thus paving the way for the development of a simple and economical process for the microbial production of flavonoids directly from glucose.",

They are formulated in this manner so that the complex mechanism of cell growth is simplified. Herein, a novel approach for modelling microbial growth kinetics is proposed, linking biomass growth and substrate consumption rates to the gene regulatory programmes that control these processes. A dynamic model of the TOL (pWW0) plasmid of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 has been developed, describing the molecular interactions that lead to the transcription of the upper and meta operons, known to produce the enzymes for the oxidative catabolism of m-xylene. The genetic circuit model was combined with a growth kinetic model decoupling biomass growth and substrate consumption rates, which are expressed as independent functions of the rate-limiting enzymes produced by the operons. Estimation of model parameters and validation of the model's predictive capability were successfully performed in batch cultures of mt-2 fed with different concentrations of m-xylene, as confirmed by relative mRNA concentration measurements of the promoters encoded in TOL. The growth formation and substrate utilisation patterns could not be accurately described by traditional Monod-type models for a wide range of conditions, demonstrating the critical importance of gene regulation for the development of advanced models closely predicting complex bioprocesses. In contrast, the proposed strategy, which utilises quantitative information pertaining to upstream molecular events that control the production of rate-limiting enzymes, predicts the catabolism of a substrate and biomass formation and could be of central importance for the design of optimal bioprocesses.",

Among all tested terpenoids, geranic acid showed very strong inhibitory activity against both fungi (MIC<46 μM). To evaluate the possibility of enhancing fungal resistance in maize by overexpressing geranic acid, we generated transgenic plants with the geraniol synthase gene cloned from Lippia dulcis under the control of a ubiquitin promoter. The volatile and non-volatile metabolite profiles of leaves from transgenic and control lines were compared. The headspaces collected from intact seedlings of transgenic and control plants were not significantly different, although detached leaves of transgenic plants emitted 5-fold more geranyl acetate compared to control plants. Non-targeted LC–MS profiling and LC–MS–MS identification of extracts from maize leaves revealed that the major significantly different non-volatile compounds were 2 geranic acid derivatives, a geraniol dihexose and 4 different types of hydroxyl-geranic acid-hexoses. A geranic acid glycoside was the most abundant, and identified by NMR as geranoyl-6-O-malonyl-β-d-glucopyranoside with an average concentration of 45 μM. Fungal bioassays with C. graminicola and F. graminearum did not reveal an effect of these changes in secondary metabolite composition on plant resistance to either fungus.

We present a pathway construction algorithm for identifying viable synthesis pathways compatible with balanced cell growth. Rather than exhaustive exploration, we investigate probabilistic selection of reactions to construct the pathways. Three different selection schemes are investigated for the selection of reactions: high metabolite connectivity, low connectivity and uniformly random. For all case studies, which involved a diverse set of target metabolites, the uniformly random selection scheme resulted in the highest average maximum yield. When compared to an exhaustive search enumerating all possible reaction routes, our probabilistic algorithm returned nearly identical distributions of yields, while requiring far less computing time (minutes vs. years). The pathways identified by our algorithm have previously been confirmed in the literature as viable, high-yield synthesis routes. Prospectively, our algorithm could facilitate the design of novel, non-native synthesis routes by efficiently exploring the diversity of biochemical transformations in nature.",

Using a variety of feedstocks for the bio-production of succinic acid would be economically beneficial to future industrial processes. Escherichia coli SBS550MG is able to grow on both glucose and fructose, but not on sucrose. Therefore, we derived a SBS550MG strain bearing both the pHL413 plasmid, which contains Lactococcus lactis pycA gene, and the pUR400 plasmid, which contains the scrK, Y, A, B, and R genes for sucrose uptake and catalyzation. Succinic acid production by this modified strain and the SBS550pHL413 strain was tested on fructose, sucrose, a mixture of glucose and fructose, a mixture of glucose, fructose and sucrose, and sucrose hydrolysis solution. The modified strain can produce succinic acid efficiently from all combinations of different carbon sources tested with minimal byproduct formation and with high molar succinate yields close to that of the maximum theoretic values. The molar succinic acid yield from fructose was the highest among the carbon sources tested. Using the mixture of glucose and fructose as the carbon source resulted in slightly lower yields and much higher productivity than using fructose alone. Fermenting sucrose mixed with fructose and glucose gave a 1.76-fold higher productivity than that when sucrose was used as the sole carbon source. Using sucrose pretreated with sulfuric acid as carbon source resulted in a similar succinic acid yield and productivity as that when using the mixture of sucrose, fructose, and glucose. The results of the effect of agitation rate in aerobic phase on succinate production showed that supplying large amount of oxygen in aerobic phase resulted in higher productions of formate and acetate, and therefore lower succinate yield.

Two of the pathway enzymes, ketol-acid reductoisomerase and alcohol dehydrogenase, require nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH); glycolysis, however, produces only nicotinamide dinucleotide (NADH).

With the aid of several hybridoma metabolic investigations as case-studies (Bonarius et al., 1995, Bonarius et al., 1996, Bonarius et al., 2001), we first establish that the TMA framework identifies biologically important aspects of the metabolic network under investigation. We also show that the use of a structured weighting approach within our objective provides a substantial modeling benefit over an unstructured, uniform, weighting approach. We then illustrate the strength of TAM as an advanced interrogation technique, first by using TMA to prove the existence of (and to quantitatively describe) multiple topologically distinct configurations of a metabolic network that each optimally model a given set of experimental observations. We further show that such alternate topologies are indistinguishable using existing stoichiometric modeling techniques, and we explain the biological significance of the topological variables appearing within our model. By leveraging the manner in which TMA implements metabolite inputs and outputs, we also show that metabolites whose possible metabolic fates are inadequately described by a given network reconstruction can be quickly identified. Lastly, we show how the use of the TMA aggregate objective function (AOF) permits the identification of modeling solutions that can simultaneously consider experimental observations, underlying biological motivations, or even purely engineering- or design-based goals.",

     "abstract": "With rising energy prices and concern over the environmental impact of fossil fuel consumption, the push to develop biomass derived fuels has increased significantly. Although most global carbon fixation occurs via the Calvin Benson Bassham cycle, there are currently five other known pathways for carbon fixation; the goal of this study was to determine the thermodynamic efficiencies of all six carbon fixation pathways for the production of biomass using flux balance analysis. The three chemotrophic pathways, the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway, the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle and the dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle, were found to be more efficient than photoautotrophic carbon fixation pathways. However, as hydrogen is not freely available, the energetic cost of hydrogen production from sunlight was calculated and included in the overall energy demand, which results in a 5 fold increase in the energy demand of chemoautotrophic carbon fixation. Therefore, when the cost of hydrogen production is included, photoautotrophic pathways are more efficient. However, the energetic cost for the production of 12 metabolic precursors was found to vary widely across the different carbon fixation pathways; therefore, different pathways may be more efficient at producing products from a single precursor than others. The results of this study have significant impact on the selection or design of autotrophic organisms for biofuel or biochemical production. Overall biomass production from solar energy is most efficient in organisms using the reductive TCA cycle, however, products derived from one metabolic precursor may be more efficiently produced using other carbon fixation pathways.",

The final engineered C. glutamicum strain was able to produce lysine with a high yield of 0.55 g per gram of glucose, a titer of 120 g L−1 lysine and a productivity of 4.0 g L−1 h−1 in fed-batch culture. The specific glucose uptake rate of the wild type could be completely maintained during the engineering process, providing a highly viable producer. For these key criteria, the genetically defined strain created in this study lies at the maximum limit of classically derived producers developed over the last fifty years. This is the first report of a rationally derived lysine production strain that may be competitive with industrial applications. The design-based strategy for metabolic engineering reported here could serve as general concept for the rational development of microorganisms as efficient cellular factories for bio-production.",

Therefore, stress robustness is an important property for their application. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) accumulation is a common denominator to a lot of these stress factors.

We have previously reported the development of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains able to produce l-AA. This was obtained by expressing the known plant pathway genes and by complementing the missing step with an animal activity. Here, we show that l-AA accumulation inside yeast cells can be improved by expressing the complete biosynthetic plant pathway and, even further, by recycling its oxidation products.These new strains can be seen in a double perspective of exploitation: as novel organisms for vitamin C production and as novel cell factories for industrial processes.",

     "abstract": "Anaerobes can obtain the entire cell's ATP by glycolysis and remove resulting reducing power by fermentation. There is a delicate balance in redox status to obtain a maximal growth of these cells, and the conditions to change redox fluxes can induce kinds of changes in metabolism. The fundamental knowledge on sensing redox status and coupling redox signals with fermentation pathways is essential for the metabolic engineering to control redox fluxes at the molecular level. A redox sensing protein (RSP) was isolated by DNA affinity chromatography, and corresponding gene was mined from genomic sequences of Thermoanaerobacter spp. The RSP shares up to 41% identity with the regulatory proteins which sense NADH and control the expression of NADH dehydrogenase in aerobic microorganisms. The operator sites for RSP were located in all the operons for ethanol fermentation rather than in that of NADH dehydrogenase. The typical operator was identified as a palindromic sequence, -ATTGTTANNNNNNTAACAAT-. NADH caused a transition of RSP from an α-helix rich to β-sheet rich conformation. In an in vitro transcription system of T. ethanolicus, RSP repressed the transcription of an alcohol dehydrogenase, whereas the repression was reversed by adding NADH. Base substitutes in the repeats of the palindrome reduced the affinity between RSP and the operator, and thus delicate regulation could be achieved. This study reveals for the first time a repressor/operator system that couples a redox signal with a fermentation pathway, and the results presented here provide valuable insights for the design of metabolic engineering.",

We, therefore, generalize MCSs to Constrained MCSs (cMCSs) allowing for the additional definition of a set of desired modes of which a minimum number must be preserved. Exemplarily for ethanol production by Escherichia coli, we demonstrate that this approach offers enormous flexibility in defining and solving knockout problems.

Pretreatment processes that hydrolyze these polysaccharides often also result in the accumulation of growth inhibitory compounds, such as acetate and furfural among others. Here, we have applied a recently reported strategy for engineering tolerance towards the goal of increasing Escherichia coli growth in the presence of elevated acetate concentrations (Lynch et al., 2007). We performed growth selections upon an E. coli genome library developed using a moderate selection pressure to identify genomic regions implicated in acetate toxicity and tolerance. These studies identified a range of high-fitness genes that are normally involved in membrane and extracellular processes, are key regulated steps in pathways, and are involved in pathways that yield specific amino acids and nucleotides. Supplementation of the products and metabolically related metabolites of these pathways significantly increased growth rate (a 130% increase in specific growth) at inhibitory acetate concentrations. Our results suggest that acetate tolerance will not involve engineering of a single pathway; rather we observe a range of potential mechanisms for overcoming acetate based inhibition.",

     "abstract": "As sequencing technologies increase in power, determining the functions of unknown proteins encoded by the DNA sequences so produced becomes a major challenge. Functional annotation is commonly done on the basis of amino-acid sequence similarity alone. Long after sequence similarity becomes undetectable by pair-wise comparison, profile-based identification of homologs can often succeed due to the conservation of position-specific patterns, important for a protein’s three dimensional folding and function. Nevertheless, prediction of protein function from homology-driven approaches is not without problems. Homologous proteins might evolve different functions and the power of homology detection has already started to reach its maximum. Computational methods for inferring protein function, which exploit the context of a protein in cellular networks, have come to be built on top of homology-based approaches. These network-based functional inference techniques provide both a first hand hint into a proteins’ functional role and offer complementary insights to traditional methods for understanding the function of uncharacterized proteins. Most recent network-based approaches aim to integrate diverse kinds of functional interactions to boost both coverage and confidence level. These techniques not only promise to solve the moonlighting aspect of proteins by annotating proteins with multiple functions, but also increase our understanding on the interplay between different functional classes in a cell. In this article we review the state of the art in network-based function prediction and describe some of the underlying difficulties and successes. Given the volume of high-throughput data that is being reported the time is ripe to employ these network-based approaches, which can be used to unravel the functions of the uncharacterized proteins accumulating in the genomic databases.",

These protein–protein interactions are of high relevance for many biological functions. In addition to many well established protein complexes an increasing number of protein–protein interactions, which form rather transient complexes has recently been discovered. The formation of such complexes seems to be a common feature especially for metabolic pathways. In the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis, we identified a protein complex of three citric acid cycle enzymes. This complex consists of the citrate synthase, the isocitrate dehydrogenase, and the malate dehydrogenase. Moreover, fumarase and aconitase interact with malate dehydrogenase and with each other. These five enzymes catalyze sequential reaction of the TCA cycle. Thus, this interaction might be important for a direct transfer of intermediates of the TCA cycle and thus for elevated metabolic fluxes via substrate channeling. In addition, we discovered a link between the TCA cycle and gluconeogenesis through a flexible interaction of two proteins: the association between the malate dehydrogenase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is directly controlled by the metabolic flux. The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase links the TCA cycle with gluconeogenesis and is essential for B. subtilis growing on gluconeogenic carbon sources. Only under gluconeogenic growth conditions an interaction of these two proteins is detectable and disappears under glycolytic growth conditions.",

The present study was dedicated to decreasing the glycerol production mostly in industrial ethanol producing yeast without affecting its desirable fermentation properties including high osmotic and ethanol tolerance, natural robustness in industrial processes. In the present study, the GPD1 gene, encoding NAD+-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in an industrial ethanol producing strain of S. cerevisiae, was deleted. Simultaneously, a non-phosphorylating NADP+-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPN) from Bacillus cereus was expressed in the mutant deletion of GPD1. Although the resultant strain AG1A (gpd1△ PPGK-gapN) exhibited a 48.7±0.3% (relative to the amount of substrate consumed) lower glycerol yield and a 7.6±0.1% (relative to the amount of substrate consumed) higher ethanol yield compared to the wild-type strain, it was sensitive to osmotic stress and failed to ferment on 25% glucose. However, when trehalose synthesis genes TPS1 and TPS2 were over-expressed in the above recombinant strain AG1A, its high osmotic stress tolerance was not only restored but also improved. In addition, this new recombinant yeast strain displayed further reduced glycerol yield, indistinguishable maximum specific growth rate (μmax) and fermentation ability compared to the wild type in anaerobic batch fermentations.

We show that anchoring the dynamic models to the same flux reduces the allowable parameter space significantly such that sampling of high dimensional kinetic parameters becomes meaningful. The methodology enables examination of the properties of the model's structure, including multiple steady states.

     "abstract": "Redox and energy balance plays a key role in determining microbial fitness. Efforts to redirect bacterial metabolism often involve overexpression and deletion of genes surrounding key central metabolites, such as pyruvate and acetyl-coA. In the case of metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for succinate production, efforts have mainly focused on the manipulation of key pyruvate metabolizing enzymes. E. coli AFP111 strain lacking ldhA, pflB and ptsG encoded activities accumulates acetate and ethanol as well as shows poor anaerobic growth on rich and minimal media. To address these issues, we first deleted genes (adhE, ackA-pta) involved in byproduct formation downstream of acetyl-CoA followed by the deletion of iclR and pdhR to activate the glyoxylate pathway. Based on data from these studies, we hypothesized that the succinate productivity was limited by the insufficient ATP generation. Genome-scale thermodynamics-based flux balance analysis indicated that overexpression of ATP-forming PEPCK from Actinobacillus succinogenes in an ldhA, pflB and ptsG triple mutant strain could result in an increase in biomass and succinate flux. Testing of this prediction confirmed that PEPCK overexpression resulted in a 60% increase in biomass and succinate formation in the ldhA, pflB, ptsG mutant strain.",

The conventional mutagenesis involved consecutive selection for resistance to riboflavin structural analog 7-methyl-8-trifluoromethyl-10-(1'-d-ribityl)isoalloxazine), 8-azaguanine, 6-azauracil, 2-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine and guanosine as well as screening for yellow colonies at high pH. The metabolic engineering approaches involved introduction of additional copies of transcription factor SEF1 and IMH3 (coding for IMP dehydrogenase) orthologs from Debaryomyces hansenii, and the homologous genes RIB1 and RIB7, encoding GTP cyclohydrolase II and riboflavin synthetase, the first and the last enzymes of riboflavin biosynthesis pathway, respectively. Overexpression of the aforementioned genes in riboflavin overproducer AF-4 obtained by classical selection resulted in a 4.1-fold increase in riboflavin production in shake-flask experiments. D. hansenii IMH3 and modified ARO4 genes conferring resistance to mycophenolic acid and fluorophenylalanine, respectively, were successfully used as new dominant selection markers for C. famata.",

Acyl-ACP thioesterases specific for shorter chain length fatty acids are therefore of considerable interest in the genetic engineering of biofuel producing organisms, both for their ability to increase the production of shorter fatty acids, and for their involvement in fatty acid secretion in bacterial systems. Here we show that the heterologous expression of two thioesterases, biased towards the production of lauric (C12:0) and myristic acid (C14:0), causes increased accumulation of shorter chain length fatty acids in the eukaryotic microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Accumulation of shorter chain length fatty acids corresponds to transgene transcript levels. We achieved levels of C12:0 of up to 6.2% of total fatty acids and C14:0 of up to 15% by weight. Unlike observations in cyanobacteria, no significant secretion of fatty acids was observed. Instead, we found that 75–90% of the shorter chain length fatty acids produced was incorporated into triacylglycerols. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of thioesterases is a valid way to improve the biofuel production phenotype of eukaryotic microalgae.",

The resultant labeling in free metabolites and biomass was analyzed by NMR and GC–MS. After taking into account the labeling of substrates supplied by the metabolically active cob, the fluxes through central metabolism were quantified by computer-aided modeling. The flux map indicates that 51–69% of the ATP produced is used for biomass synthesis and up to 47% is expended in substrate cycling.

One of the clones had six out of nine of these metabolites. Overall, the concentration of these metabolites of interest were significantly changed in transgenic root cultures, for instance shikimic acid was recorded at the highest level in clone A4T-A.

Through metabolic engineering of E. coli metabolism, succinate production was greatly elevated by (1) blocking pathways for the synthesis of competing by-products lactate, ethanol, and acetate and (2) expressing Lactococcus lactis pyruvate carboxylase to drive the generation of succinate from the pyruvate node (as opposed to that of phosphoenolpyruvate). As such, these metabolic engineering strategies coupled cell growth to succinate production because the synthesis of succinate remained as the primary route of NAD+ regeneration. This feature enabled the operation of the succinate pathway in the absence of selective pressure (e.g. antibiotics).

As determined by real-time PCR, the transcription of adhE was activated by ethanol, while adhB was transcribed without ethanol; however, all of their transcription was reduced at higher ethanol concentrations. Under imitating physiological conditions, AdhE played a crucial role in ethanol formation, and AdhB favored ethanol consumption when ethanol concentration was high e.g. 1%.

In most of the available multiobjective optimization methods, there is a lack of understanding of when to use a particular objective, and how to combine and/or prioritize mutually competing objectives to achieve a truly optimal solution. To address these limitations we developed a soft constraints based linear physical programming-based flux balance analysis (LPPFBA) framework to obtain a multiobjective optimal solutions. The developed framework was first applied to compute a set of multiobjective optimal solutions for various pairs of objectives relevant to hepatocyte function (urea secretion, albumin, NADPH, and glutathione syntheses) in bioartificial liver systems. Next, simultaneous analysis of the optimal solutions for three objectives was carried out. Further, this framework was utilized to obtain true optimal conditions to improve the hepatic functions in a simulated bioartificial liver system. The combined quantitative and visualization framework of LPPFBA is applicable to any large-scale metabolic network system, including those derived by genomic analyses.",

     "abstract": "The biocatalytic reduction of d-xylose to xylitol requires separation of the substrate from l-arabinose, another major component of hemicellulosic hydrolysate. This step is necessitated by the innate promiscuity of xylose reductases, which can efficiently reduce l-arabinose to l-arabinitol, an unwanted byproduct. Unfortunately, due to the epimeric nature of d-xylose and l-arabinose, separation can be difficult, leading to high production costs. To overcome this issue, we engineered an E. coli strain to efficiently produce xylitol from d-xylose with minimal production of l-arabinitol byproduct. By combining this strain with a previously engineered xylose reductase mutant, we were able to eliminate l-arabinitol formation and produce xylitol to near 100% purity from an equiweight mixture of d-xylose, l-arabinose, and d-glucose.",

To avoid metabolite leakage during quenching, metabolite quantification (glycolytic and TCA-cycle intermediates and nucleotides) was carried out with a differential method, whereby the amounts measured in the filtrate were subtracted from the amounts measured in total broth. The dynamic metabolite profiles obtained from the BioScope perturbations were very comparable with the profiles obtained from the chemostat perturbation.

Chemical stress is routinely encountered in bioprocessing to produce chemicals or fuels from renewable substrates, in whole-cell biocatalysis and bioremediation. Cells respond, adapt and may develop tolerance to chemicals by mechanisms only partially explored, especially for multiple simultaneous stresses. More is known about how cells respond to chemicals, but less about how to develop tolerant strains. Aiming to stimulate new metabolic engineering and synthetic-biology approaches for tolerant-strain development, this review takes a holistic, comparative and modular approach in bringing together the large literature on genes, programs, mechanisms, processes and molecules involved in chemical stress or imparting tolerance. These include stress proteins and transcription factors, efflux pumps, altered membrane composition, stress-adapted energy metabolism, chemical detoxification, and accumulation of small-molecule chaperons and compatible solutes. The modular organization (by chemicals, mechanism, organism, and methods used) imparts flexibility in exploring this complex literature, while comparative analyses point to hidden commonalities, such as an oxidative stress response underlying some solvent and carboxylic-acid stress.

     "abstract": "In the present work the Gram-positive bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum was engineered into an efficient, tailor-made production strain for diaminopentane (cadaverine), a highly attractive building block for bio-based polyamides. The engineering comprised expression of lysine decarboxylase (ldcC) from Escherichia coli, catalyzing the conversion of lysine into diaminopentane, and systems-wide metabolic engineering of central supporting pathways. Substantially re-designing the metabolism yielded superior strains with desirable properties such as (i) the release from unwanted feedback regulation at the level of aspartokinase and pyruvate carboxylase by introducing the point mutations lysC311 and pycA458, (ii) an optimized supply of the key precursor oxaloacetate by amplifying the anaplerotic enzyme, pyruvate carboxylase, and deleting phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase which otherwise removes oxaloacetate, (iii) enhanced biosynthetic flux via combined amplification of aspartokinase, dihydrodipicolinate reductase, diaminopimelate dehydrogenase and diaminopimelate decarboxylase, and (iv) attenuated flux into the threonine pathway competing with production by the leaky mutation hom59 in the homoserine dehydrogenase gene. Lysine decarboxylase proved to be a bottleneck for efficient production, since its in vitro activity and in vivo flux were closely correlated. To achieve an optimal strain having only stable genomic modifications, the combination of the strong constitutive C. glutamicum tuf promoter and optimized codon usage allowed efficient genome-based ldcC expression and resulted in a high diaminopentane yield of 200 mmol mol−1. By supplementing the medium with 1 mg L−1 pyridoxal, the cofactor of lysine decarboxylase, the yield was increased to 300 mmol mol−1. In the production strain obtained, lysine secretion was almost completely abolished. Metabolic analysis, however, revealed substantial formation of an as yet unknown by-product. It was identified as an acetylated variant, N-acetyl-diaminopentane, which reached levels of more than 25% of that of the desired product.",

In this study, growth rate and PHB flux were quantified directly in response to systematic manipulation of (1) gene expression in the product-forming pathway and (2) growth rates in a nitrogen-limited chemostat. Gene expression manipulation revealed acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (phaB) limits flux to PHB, although overexpression of the entire pathway pushed the flux even higher. These increases in PHB flux are accompanied by decreases in growth rate, which can be explained by carbon diversion, rather than toxic effects of the PHB pathway. In chemostats, PHB flux was insensitive to growth rate.

     "abstract": "The understanding and engineering of complex phenotypes is a critical issue in biotechnology. Conventional approaches for engineering such phenotypes are often resource intensive, marginally effective, and unable to generate the level of biological understanding desired. Here, we report a new approach for rapidly dissecting a complex phenotype that is based upon the combination of genome-scale growth phenotype data, precisely targeted growth selections, and informatic strategies for abstracting and summarizing data onto coherent biological processes. We measured at high resolution (125 NT) and for the entire genome the effect of increased gene copy number on overall biological fitness corresponding to the expression of a complex phenotype (tolerance to 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) in Escherichia coli). Genetic level fitness data were then mapped according to various definitions of gene–gene interaction in order to generate network-level fitness data. When metabolic pathways were used to define interactions, we observed that genes within the chorismate and threonine super-pathways were disproportionately enriched throughout selections for 3-HP tolerance. Biochemical and genetic studies demonstrated that alleviation of inhibition of either of these super-pathways was sufficient to mitigate 3-HP toxicity. These data enabled the design of combinatorial modifications that almost completely offset 3-HP toxicity in minimal medium resulting in a 20 g/L and 25-fold increase in tolerance and specific growth, respectively.",

Six new kinetic parameters of the augmented model were estimated with considerations of available experimental data and other published works. Major differences between calculated and reference concentrations and fluxes were explained. Sensitivities and underlying competition among fluxes for carbon sources were consistent with intuitive expectations based on metabolic network and previous results. Biosynthesis rates of serine and tryptophan were simultaneously maximized using the augmented model via concurrent gene knockout and manipulation. The optimization results were obtained using the elitist non-dominant sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) supported by pattern recognition heuristics. A range of Pareto-optimal enzyme activities regulating the amino acids biosynthesis was successfully obtained and elucidated wherever possible vis-à-vis fermentation work based on recombinant DNA technology. The predicted potential improvements in various metabolic pathway recipes using the multi-objective optimization strategy were highlighted and discussed in detail.",

The selected library inserts were placed so that antisense (to the rRNAs) non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) would be transcribed from Pthl. Different enriched inserts imparted similar butyrate-tolerance characteristics. A minimal tolerance fragment (RDNA7) was identified as the 16S-rRNA promoter region. Expressed on plasmid pRD7 off Pthl, RDNA7 can produce putative ncRNAs termed ncRNARD7. C. acetobutylicum 824(pRD7) showed superior resistance to butyrate and other carboxylic acids. Transcriptional analysis of butyrate stress identified 120 differentially expressed genes between 824(pRD7) and 824(pSOS95del). The few upregulated genes included the ffh gene of the putative signal recognition particle (SRP) system. Northern analysis of ncRNARD7 and corresponding antisense RNAs demonstrated multiple ncRNARD7 molecules in 824(pRD7). Several corresponding antisense RNA molecules were identified both in 824(pRD7) and 824(pSOS95del), but at much higher levels in 824(pRD7).

Nevertheless, a low lactate flux is initiated as the growth rate declined in the transition to the stationary phase, which coincides with a drastic decrease in the glucose consumption and acetate production fluxes. In addition, the decrease in growth rate was accompanied by a sudden increase and then decrease in NADH levels. The V′MAX of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) doubled when the cells entered the stationary phase. Kinetic analysis revealed that at the metabolic level LDH activity is regulated through (i) competitive inhibition by pyrophosphate (PPi, ki=1.7 mM) and NAD (ki=0.43 mM) and (ii) allosteric activation by FBP (300%), ATP (160%) and ADP (140%). From these data a MWC-based model was derived. Simulations with this model could explain the observed lactate shift by displaying how the sensitivity of LDH activity to NADH/NAD ratio varied with different PPi concentrations. Moreover, the activation of LDH by ATP indicates that C. saccharolyticus uses LDH as a means to adjusts its flux of ATP and NADH production. To our knowledge, this is the first time PPi is observed as an effector of LDH.",

Heterologous expression of novel combinations of enzymes promises to provide new or improved synthetic routes towards a substantially increased diversity of small molecules. Recently, we constructed a synthetic pathway to produce d-glucaric acid, a molecule that has been deemed a “top-value added chemical” from biomass, starting from glucose. Limiting flux through the pathway is the second recombinant step, catalyzed by myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX), whose activity is strongly influenced by the concentration of the myo-inositol substrate. To synthetically increase the effective concentration of myo-inositol, polypeptide scaffolds were built from protein–protein interaction domains to co-localize all three pathway enzymes in a designable complex as previously described (Dueber et al., 2009). Glucaric acid titer was found to be strongly affected by the number of scaffold interaction domains targeting upstream Ino1 enzymes, whereas the effect of increased numbers of MIOX-targeted domains was much less significant. We determined that the scaffolds directly increased the specific MIOX activity and that glucaric acid titers were strongly correlated with MIOX activity. Overall, we observed an approximately 5-fold improvement in product titers over the non-scaffolded control, and a 50% improvement over the previously reported highest titers. These results further validate the utility of these synthetic scaffolds as a tool for metabolic engineering.",

     "abstract": "The physiological state of CHO cells in perfusion culture was quantified by determining fluxes through the bioreaction network using 13C glucose and 2D-NMR spectroscopy. CHO cells were cultivated in a 2.5 L perfusion bioreactor with glucose and glutamine as the primary carbon and energy sources. The reactor was inoculated at a cell density of 8×106 cells/mL and operated at ∼10×106 cells/mL using unlabeled glucose for the first 13 days. The second phase lasted 12 days and the medium consisted of 10% [U-13C]glucose, 40% labeled [1-13C]glucose with the balance unlabeled. After the culture attained isotopic steady state, biomass samples from the last 3 days of cultivation were considered representative and used for flux estimation. They were hydrolyzed and analyzed by 2D [13C, 1H] COSY measurements using the heteronuclear single quantum correlation sequence with gradients for artifacts suppression. Metabolic fluxes were determined using the 13C-Flux software package by minimizing the residuals between the experimental and the simulated NMR data. Normalized residuals exhibited a Gaussian distribution indicating good model fit to experimental data. The glucose consumption rate was 5-fold higher than that of glutamine with 41% of glucose channeled through the pentose phosphate pathway. The fluxes at the pyruvate branch point were almost equally distributed between lactate and the TCA cycle (55% and 45%, respectively). The anaplerotic conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase accounted for 10% of the pyruvate flux with the remaining 90% entering the TCA cycle through acetyl-CoA. The conversion of malate to pyruvate catalyzed by the malic enzyme was 70% higher than that for the anaplerotic reaction catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase. Most amino acid catabolic and biosynthetic fluxes were significantly lower than the glycolytic and TCA cycle fluxes. Metabolic flux data from NMR analysis validated a simplified model where metabolite balancing was used for flux estimation. In this reduced flux space, estimates from these two methods were in good agreement. This simplified model can routinely be used in bioprocess development experiments to estimate metabolic fluxes with much reduced analytical investment. The high resolution flux information from 2D-NMR spectroscopy coupled with the capability to validate a simplified metabolite balancing based model for routine use make 13C-isotopomer analysis an attractive bioprocess development tool for mammalian cell cultures.",

Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of vesicle trafficking have enabled the identification of key regulators that control the flow of recombinant proteins along the secretory pathway. Here, we report that transgenic expression of Munc18b, a Sec1/Munc18 (SM) protein regulating the fusion of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane, enhances the secretory capacity of HeLa, HEK-293 and HT-1080 and so increases overall production of different secreted human glycoproteins as well as the titer of lentiviral particles produced in HEK-293-derived helper cells. Targeted interventions in secretory vesicle trafficking by Munc18b is a novel secretion engineering strategy, which harnesses the full secretory capacity of mammalian cells. Secretion engineering is the latest-generation metabolic engineering strategy, which could improve future therapies by increasing the production of biopharmaceuticals by boosting the secretion performance of cell implants in cell therapy initiatives and by raising the production titers of transgenic viral particles used for gene therapy applications.",

     "abstract": "Metabolic engineering of cellular systems to maximize reaction fluxes or metabolite concentrations still presents a significant challenge by encountering unpredictable instabilities that can be caused by simultaneous or consecutive enhancements of many reaction steps. It can therefore be important to select carefully small subsets of key enzymes for their subsequent stable modification compatible with cell physiology. To address this important problem, we introduce a general mixed integer non-linear problem (MINLP) formulation to compute automatically which enzyme levels should be modulated and which enzyme regulatory structures should be altered to achieve the given optimization goal using non-linear kinetic models of relevant cellular systems. The developed MINLP formulation directly employs a stability analysis constraint and also includes non-linear biophysical constraints to describe homeostasis conditions for metabolite concentrations and protein machinery without any preliminary model simplification (e.g. linlog kinetics approximation). The framework is demonstrated on a well-established large-scale kinetic model of the Escherichia coli central metabolism used for the optimization of the glucose uptake through the phosphotransferase transport system (PTS) and serine biosynthesis. Computational results show that substantial stable improvements can be predicted by manipulating only small subsets of enzyme levels and regulatory structures. This means that while more efforts can be required to elucidate larger stable optimal enzyme level/regulation choices, no further significant increase in the optimized fluxes can be obtained and, therefore, such choices may not be worth the effort due to the potential loss of stability properties. The source for instability through saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations is identified, and all results are contrasted with predictions from metabolic control analysis.",

     "abstract": "The insect cells/baculovirus system is well recognized as a safe and suitable technology to produce heterologous proteins, vaccines and vectors for gene therapy. Efficient and robust production processes, able to deliver higher product concentrations, are however still needed to cope with increased requirements for large-scale manufacture. The work herein presented describes a combined experimental and modelling effort to quantify and environmentally manipulate the metabolism of Spodoptera frugiperda cells, targeting high cell density production of baculovirus vectors with potential application in human gene therapy. Culture medium supplementation with pyruvate or α-ketoglutarate at the time of infection resulted in 6–7-fold higher specific baculovirus yields at high cell density when compared to control cultures. This pushed volumetric titers to levels higher than classical low cell density infections. A quantitative description of intracellular pathways is provided using metabolic flux analysis; a direct stimulation of carbon flow through the tricarboxylic acids cycle was observed. Analysis of flux partitioning coefficients at the pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate branch-points further revealed a metabolic transition to a more energetically active state, which was confirmed by increased intracellular adenosine triphosphate generation rates. These results represent a cost-efficient and scalable strategy for high cell density production of recombinant baculovirus vectors.",

     "abstract": "Proteolytic and cataplerotic sources of hepatic glutamine were determined by 2H NMR analysis of urinary phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN) 2H-enrichments in eight healthy subjects after 2H2O and phenylbutyric acid ingestion. Body water enrichment was 0.49±0.03%. PAGN was enriched to lower levels with significant differences between the various glutamine positions. PAGN position 2 enrichment=0.33±0.02%; 3R=0.27±0.02%; 3S=0.27±0.02% and position 4=0.17±0.01%. Position 3R,S enrichments are conditional with the net conversion of citrate to glutamate and are therefore markers of cataplerosis. From the ratio of positions 3R,S to body water enrichment, 55±3% of hepatic glutamine was derived from cataplerosis and 45±3% from proteolysis. In conclusion, enrichment of PAGN 3R,S hydrogens relative to that of body water reflects the contribution of cataplerotic and proteolytic sources to hepatic glutamine.",

     "abstract": "Hyaluronic acid is a biopolymer with valuable applications in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus cells transformed with a nisin-inducible, empty plasmid control displayed higher molecular weight. This increase in molecular weight is independent of the nisin promoter or antibiotic resistance. Using 2D DIGE followed by mass spectrometry, we identified up-regulation of the last step in UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine biosynthesis (GlmU) and down-regulation of the first step in peptidoglycan biosynthesis (MurA) as possible mechanism for the plasmid effect. Over-expression of GlmU to further increase activity had no effect on UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine levels or molecular weight, while over-expression of MurA reduced UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine levels and molecular weight. Global transcriptional analysis revealed that differential regulation of GlmU and MurA activity was not reflected in transcription levels. This results, suggest that regulation is at a translational or post-translational level. Differential expression of two clp proteases may explain this effect as well as the small but significant changes in transcription levels of nearly 300 genes.",

This concept was applied upon genetic engineering of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis, conferring the ability to generate volatile isoprene hydrocarbons from CO2 and H2O. Heterologous expression of the Pueraria montana (kudzu) isoprene synthase (IspS) gene in Synechocystis enabled photosynthetic isoprene generation in these cyanobacteria. Codon-use optimization of the kudzu IspS gene improved expression of the isoprene synthase in Synechocystis. Use of the photosynthesis psbA2 promoter, to drive the expression of the IspS gene, resulted in a light-intensity-dependent isoprene synthase expression. Results showed that oxygenic photosynthesis can be re-directed to generate useful small volatile hydrocarbons, while consuming CO2, without a prior requirement for the harvesting, dewatering and processing of the respective biomass.",
