     "abstract": "Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is regarded as an important prototype photocatalytic material for several decades. The charge carrier kinetics determines the photocatalytic properties of TiO2 materials; this is found to be greatly dependent on electronic structures. It has been revealed that the intrinsic intermediate gap states (intrinsic GSs) play a significant role in charge carrier kinetics that drive the photocatalytic processes of TiO2 materials, which are not well summarized until now. Motivated by this thought, the purpose of this review focuses on physiochemical science of the intrinsic GSs of TiO2 materials and their important role in charge carrier kinetics. We first give a summary on the chemical resources of the intrinsic GSs in TiO2 and their physiochemical nature. Their general energy distribution, charge carrier population, and the associated thermodynamic properties are also elaborated from an overall viewpoint. We further carefully summarize and compare the experimental studies on the energy and the density distribution of the intrinsic GSs and discuss the associated chemical resources and charge carrier localizations. Trapping is the dominant function of intrinsic GSs in the charge carrier kinetics of TiO2 materials. The significant effect of trapping on the transport, recombination, and interfacial transfer of charge carriers are also comprehensive summarized. Furthermore, the effects of charge carrier kinetics on photocatalytic performances are also discussed to some extents. Because of the importance of intrinsic GSs in modulating charge carrier kinetics, it is expected to increase the photocatalytic activity by engineering the intrinsic GSs, not only for TiO2 materials, but also for the other semiconductor photocatalysts.",

     "abstract": "Solar energy-driven semiconductor photocatalysis has gathered increasing interest in the field of energy and environmental applications. However, a vital problem that limits its application is that photocatalysis requires a continuous light source to perform redox reaction. The ability of keeping catalytic activity in the dark has been the ultimate goal for the wide application of photocatalysis. More and more efforts have been paid to develop photocatalysts to perform photocatalytic reactions under both light and dark conditions, which is so called “round-the-clock photocatalytic system” (RTCPS). RTCPS with an ability of energy storage can work well under both daytime and nighttime, which widely used in the removal of heavy metal ion, the degradation of organic pollutant, disinfection and hydrogen generation. The important potential of RTCPS necessitate timely reviews of the recent advances to streamline efforts. Thus, this review aimed to summarize the recent advances in RTCPS, including the mechanism, characterization techniques and applications. Moreover, future challenge and research direction on the mechanistic study, material design and potential applications are also discussed.",

     "abstract": "To relieve the growing pressure originated from the energy shortage and environmental issues, solar-energy conversion into chemical or electrical energy has undergone an unprecedented development as a promising strategy in recent years. Indium sulfide (In2S3), an efficient visible-light harvester, has been extensively investigated in the field of photoconversion, owing to the fascinating merits including superior photo-absorption coefficient, photoelectric sensitivity, favorable carrier mobility, moderate band gap, excellent stability, and low toxicity. To take full advantage of these properties and further expand beyond the existing short board like low quantum efficiency, various In2S3-based functional nanostructures like nanoparticles, nanotubes, atomic two-dimensional sheets, and nanosheets-assembled complexes have been developed. Meanwhile, pleasurable characters of In2S3 have been modulated via defective engineering, doping, and hybridization (with inorganic materials or bio-molecules). Gratifyingly, In2S3-based photocatalytic, photoelectrocatalytic and photovoltaic systems have made significant impact on the field of energy and environmental issues. Therefore, this review provides an overview of crystal and morphologic structures of pristine In2S3 as well as many outstanding properties. Moreover, the pristine In2S3 and its derivatives with diverse synthesis routes are systematically summarized. Further, the advancement of In2S3-based photocatalytic, photoelectrocatalytic and photovoltaic systems, especially in environmental decontamination, artificial photosynthesis for renewable fuels and solar cells, are highlighted in detail. Ultimately, we conclude with a summary and propose some invigorating perspectives on the challenges from atomic (or macroscopical) structure modulation in material nature, photochemical behavior understanding to solar photovoltaic applications at the forefront of this research platform.",

     "publication date": "12-2018",
     "abstract": "Fluorescent carbon dots (C-dots) are new class of nanomaterials with widespread applications in optoelectronics, bio-imaging, catalysis, and sensing. The origin of photoluminescence of carbon dots is a debatable issue which is pretend to depend on the chemical structures such as graphitic conjugated core, molecular fluorophores and the surface defect states found to be dependent on the method of preparation. In this review, we have illustrated the important issues and challenges of the luminescent carbon dots and their potential applications. Graphitic conjugated core containing carbon dots is being synthesized usually from bulk materials like graphite, graphene and graphene oxide which exhibit size dependent photoluminescence behaviour due to quantum confinement. On the other hand, carbon dots synthesized from small molecules exhibit excitation dependent emission due to the presence of surface energy trap states which can be tuned by surface modification. Again, presence of both conjugated core and surface defect generates dual emission property. It is evident that various molecular fluorophores are produced inside carbon dots during low temperature synthesis. Hetero-atom doping is another strategy to tune the photoluminescence properties of carbon dots. Red emitting carbon dots are found to be suitable for bio-imaging applications after surface modification. Again, high quantum yield and solar light absorbing carbon dots are required for light harvesting and optoelectronic applications. Surface modified carbon dots are found to be appropriate for sensing applications. Analysis reveals that carbon dots based hybrid systems provide good applicability towards construction of solar cell devices because of their efficient charge separation.",

     "abstract": "Herein, we review studies on the dynamics of excited radical ions. The enhanced reactivities of excited radical ions are recognized by many researchers based on product analysis studies conducted around 1980. For cases involving fluorescent excited radical ions, lifetime measurements provide information on excited states, and they sometimes lead to confusion owing to emissive byproducts resulting from their higher reactivities. Nanosecond laser flash photolysis studies provide evidence of the reactions of excited radical ions, and analyses of their kinetics reveal properties such as their excited-state lifetimes despite an indirect manner. Recent femtosecond laser flash photolysis studies provide detailed pictures of excited radical ions, though such studies are few. Furthermore, studies on dyad or triad systems, including excited radical ions, show electron transfer dynamics and disclose characteristics of excited radical ions that differ from those in neutral states. Larger electronic coupling and smaller dumping factor are reported as important characteristics of electron transfer systems of excited radical ions. These systematic studies on excited radical ions demonstrate their suitability for applications.",

In the present review the aspect of material science behind the realization of the effect of optical limiting, OL (or optical power limiting, OPL), will be considered focusing on those materials based on conjugated metallo-macrocycles like porphyrins, phthalocyanines and derivatives. The choice of these molecular materials for OL purposes is motivated by the fact that the optical properties of such annulated systems can be finely modulated in a controlled fashion by changing the chemical structure of the complex. These changes involve the variation of the central metal, the extent of electronic conjugation of the ring, the nature and the number of peripheral ligands, and the eventual introduction of axial ligands coordinated by a central metals with a valence higher than +2. An attempt will be made to establish relationships between the structure of the macrocyclic complex and the relative OL properties taking into account the most recent developments in the field. During this analysis we will also discuss the aspect of optically passivity, i.e. the characteristic of the OL materials of undergoing fast changes of optical properties according to an internal mechanism of self-activation.",

In this review article, publications about the PSCs were summarized along their ‘submitted date’, to record the course of the progress. At the first stage, the PSCs were established as nano-structured solar cells. The efficiency up to 15% attracted the researchers in dye-sensitized solar cells and organic thin-film solar cells. After the appearance of planar hetero-junction type PSCs, the power generation mechanism has been argued. Around that time, several issues arose, such as I–V hysteresis and chloride contents. Although there were several severe comments about these issues, the developments of the PSCs progressed steadily, then efficiencies over 20% were reported.

Currently, the development of such devices does not extend beyond laboratory research. In the future, these electrodes could be used in biosensors, solar cells, and as a new technique to investigate photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes. Efficiency of light-to-current conversion is particularly important for solar cell applications. Selection of a suitable substrate for special pigment-protein complexes is a significant challenge for building an inexpensive and efficient device. Various combinations of pigment-protein complexes and substrates, as well as different measurement conditions make it difficult to directly compare performance of various solar cells. However, it has been shown, that one of the possible substrate materials, namely nanostructured TiO2, is the most preferred material for the immobilization of pigment-protein complexes in terms of both cost and efficiency. The photocurrent values reaching several mA, were reported for TiO2-based biohybrid electrodes. However, the efficiency of TiO2-based biohybrid is still far from its potential maximum value due to fundamental challenges related to designing an optimum interface between TiO2 nanostructure and pigment-protein complexes containing electron transferring cofactors.

The stepwise 2PA can selectively produce a higher excited state with relatively high spatial selectivity, and therefore, it can be an efficient tool to explore and realize nonlinear photoresponsive materials beyond Kasha’s rule. Moreover, if a photogenerated chemical species is used as an intermediate state of the stepwise 2PA, the power threshold to promote the stepwise 2PA can be greatly reduced compared with that of a simultaneous 2PA, and conventional LEDs and even sunlight could be used to induce the stepwise 2PA. Because of these advantages, the stepwise 2PA has been widely studied more than a half century ago not only for fundamental physics and chemistry but also for applications to optical memory, holography, and artificial photosynthesis. In this review, we overview various types of stepwise 2PA processes from the viewpoints of history, fundamentals, and applications. Especially we focus on the stepwise 2PA processes related to photochromic reactions because the combination of photochromic reactions and stepwise 2PA processes has realized various potentially-applicable nonlinear photoresponsive materials and found several anomalous phenomena beyond the one-photon photophysical and photochemical reactions. The stepwise 2PA processes are mainly divided into two categories involving an electronic excited state or a photogenerated transient species as the intermediates states of the stepwise 2PA. These two types of the stepwise 2PAs are explained respectively, and finally, the summary and outlook are presented.",

Although singlet fission was first observed about 50 years ago in anthracene crystals, and the mechanism has been investigated in detail for a small number of molecular systems such as tetracene and pentacene crystals, the relationships between molecular or crystal structures and singlet fission efficiency are yet to be precisely clarified. Thus, molecular structure – singlet fission relationships and molecular or crystal design guidelines for efficient singlet fission are intensely desired for realizing efficient photovoltaic energy conversion, and experimental and theoretical investigations advance rapidly. We introduce three investigation steps, which are based on bottom-up theoretical modeling from a molecule to a molecular aggregate or crystal.

These include: (1) the discovery of the light-driven molecular motor, (2) the first generation of light-driven molecular motors with unidirectional rotation, which have two chiral carbon atoms in a molecule, (3) the second generation of light-driven molecular motors with unidirectional rotation, which have a single chiral carbon atom in a molecule.Finally, two distinctive novel photochromic systems are introduced in which the reactions proceed stereoselectively, although their enantio- or diastereoselectivity during photochromic reactions have yet to be examined.",

     "abstract": "Methyl iodide (CH3I) is one of the most studied molecule in the field of photochemistry. This molecule has been investigated by a variety of light sources including lamps, different lasers as well as synchrotron radiation of varying intensity and wavelength. In this review, photoionisation studies of CH3I have been summarised for monomer (CH3I) and its aggregates i.e., cluster (CH3I)n which were excited with a range of photon energy and intensity using different sources. For the case of monomer, ionisation process follows either ionisation followed by dissociation (ladder climbing mechanism) or dissociation followed by ionisation (ladder switching mechanism) depending upon the wavelength and intensity of ionisation source. In case of CH3I ionisation by synchrotron radiation, singly and doubly charged molecular ions were observed depending upon the energy of photon. For ionisation using laser sources, singly and multiply charged ions were observed for laser pulses ranging from femtosecond to nanosecond duration. For the case of cluster (CH3I)n ionisation with laser sources, multiply charged ions were observed leading to Coulomb explosion phenomena. Lowest possible laser intensity observed to induce Coulomb explosion in CH3I clusters was ∼109 W/cm2 using nanosecond laser pulses. Since observation of multiply charged ion at gigawatt intensity is surprising, a detailed description of experimental results has been summarised. A three stage cluster ionisation model which comprises of multiphoton ionization ignited-inverse Bremsstrahlung heating and electron ionization has been adapted to explain experimental observations and to understand nanosecond laser induced Coulomb explosion of CH3I clusters.",

This paper reviews the state-of-the-art progress of the electrochemically synthesized pristine hematite photoanodes for PEC water splitting. The fundamental principles and mechanisms of anodic electrodeposition, metal anodization, cathodic electrodeposition and potential cycling/pulsed electrodeposition are elucidated in detail.

Furthermore, the surface and interfacial modifications of hematite-based nanostructured photoanodes, including elemental doping, surface treatment and heterojunctions are elaborated and appraised. This review paper is concluded with a summary and some future prospects on the challenges and research direction in this cutting-edge research hotspot.

     "abstract": "The remarkable physicochemical properties of graphene (GR) and derivatives can be leveraged in the photocatalytic activity of GR-semiconductor photocatalysts. The hitherto state of knowledge on the role of GR in these composite materials is insufficient and leaves many questions unanswered, thus it is imperative to fully understand the interaction mechanisms between GR and inorganic semiconductors. Detailed study and optimization of the features related to the interface are still very much sought to efficiently design photocatalysts targeting their eventual commercialization. This review shows that photocatalytic activity of such composites depends not only on high GR electron mobility and charge transfer, but also on the properties of the interface (such as interface morphology, size, crystal phases and facet, dimensionality of composites, etc.). Focusing on the last advancements in this field, this review analyses the challenges involved in the synthetic strategies of GR-semiconductor photo(electro)catalysts in various applications including pollutant degradation, organic synthesis, hydrogen evolution and photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2). Mechanism of interaction between GR and semiconductors are thoroughly discussed by examining the proposed mechanism in the diverse areas where the composite materials are employed in photo(electro)catalytic processes. In addition, various synthetic and characterization technique available hitherto are presented, since they are pivotal to the understanding of the composites properties (such as morphology, crystal phases and exposed facets, degree of crystallinity, dimensionality etc.), and even to shed more light on interaction mechanisms of the photocatalyst constituents. As a future outlook, it is envisaged that research will not only focus on optimizing GR electrical and chemical properties, yet in the synthesis of GR-semiconductor photocatalysts attention needs also be placed on the properties of the resulting composites, using suitable synthetic methods and proper characterizations to assess their performance.",

     "abstract": "The past decades have witnessed great research efforts based on nanotechnology and molecular engineering for the development of photo-induced devices, aiming at conversion of solar energy into electricity and fuels as well as the use of solar light for environmental remediation. The main challenge of this exciting field is to find suitable ways of assembling different materials into a single platform while making them capable of performing specific tasks, such as light-harvesting, charge transport or catalysis. In this scenario, layer-by-layer (LbL) thin film deposition appears a very promising technique, since it provides an unprecedented control of film thickness at molecular and nanometric scales by the sequential deposition of multifunctional complementary materials via different types of intermolecular interactions. Additionally, the films are generally deposited from precursors in liquid solutions or suspensions onto a large variety of substrates of either planar or curved surfaces, from rigid to flexible materials. These features make the LbL technique very affordable in terms of cost and ease of execution and it can be applied to virtually any type of material. The present manuscript provides a comprehensive review of photo-induced devices for energy conversion and environmental remediation based on LbL films composed of photoactive/photocatalytic nanomaterials. Its main goal is to give to a general readership the fundamental aspects of film assembly via the LbL technique, a detailed description of the different film nanoarchitectures, and finally, the outstanding photochemical and photoelectrochemical performance of photo-induced LbL assembled devices.",

     "abstract": "A large variety of reduced titanium dioxide (TiO2-x) materials have been reported recently. Reduced TiO2, usually resulting from the removal of oxygen atoms or hydrogen incorporation, is proved to be efficient for achieving highly photocatalytic performance including photodegradation of organic compounds, hydrogen generation from water splitting, CO2 reduction for CH4 evolution, solar cells, etc. To further improve the properties and activities of TiO2-x, a combination of the Ti3+ self-doping and other traditional modifications like nonmetals doping has been proposed in the past decades. This paper provides a general and critical review on the further modifications on reduced TiO2 samples, including non-metal elements (N, B, S, F and I) doping, noble-metal (Au, Pt, Pd and Ag) and iron-group metal (Fe, Co and Ni) grafting, metal oxide compositing, carbon (nanotubes and graphene) and carbon-based-material compositing, special facets exposure (mainly dual {001}-{101} and {111}-{110} facets) of TiO2-x and ordered structure controlling of TiO2-x. These modifications enhance the physical and/or chemical properties of the reduced TiO2, or create new features for the modified TiO2-x samples, which finally leads to the enhancement of photocatalytic performance. Key examples such as N-doping, Au grafting and graphene-based compositing are discussed carefully, and the mechanisms for solar light enhancement, electron transfer and charge separation are also investigated. Finally, some challenging issues on TiO2-x catalysts are also proposed to encourage new approaches for preparation of TiO2-x catalysts with efficiently photocatalytic performance.",

This approach had been theoretically predicted and, in 2004, was experimentally demonstrated by our group for enhancing the visible emission from InGaN/GaN quantum wells (QWs). Exciton–SP coupling increases the spontaneous emission rates of the excited states, causes a relative reduction in nonradiative relaxation, and ultimately increases the internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) of such devices. Here, we present a brief history of the increases in emission efficiency that have been achieved and the underlying mechanism thereof. This method has the potential to enable the development of high-efficiency light-emitting diodes (LEDs), eventually leading to the replacement of fluorescent lights with solid-state light sources. After the initial discovery of this phenomenon, many device structures were proposed and reported; however, their emission efficiencies have thus far remained insufficient for practical application. Here, we also present recent progress on device applications and the current problems that must be solved.

     "abstract": "A large variety of electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) have been recently developed to remove organic pollutants from wastewaters to avoid their serious health-risk factors from their environmental accumulation and to reuse the treated water for human activities. The effectiveness of EAOPs is based on the in situ production of strong reactive oxygen species (ROS) like hydroxyl radical (OH). Photoelectrocatalysis (PEC) has emerged as a promising powerful EAOP by combining photocatalytic and electrolytic processes. It consists in the promotion of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of a semiconductor photocatalyst upon light irradiation, with production of positive holes. The fast recombination of the electron/hole pairs formed is avoided in PEC by applying an external bias potential to the photocatalyst that extracts the photogenerated electrons up to the cathode of the electrolytic cell. Organics can be oxidized directly by the holes, •OH formed from water oxidation with holes and other ROS produced between the electrons and dissolved O2. This paper presents a general and critical review on the application of PEC to the remediation of wastewaters with organic pollutants. Special attention is made over the different kinds of photocatalysts utilized and preparation methods of the most ubiquitous TiO2 materials. Typical PEC systems and main operation variables that affect the effectiveness of the degradation process are also examined.

     "abstract": "Solar energy has a great potential as a clean, cheap, renewable and sustainable energy source, but it must be captured and transformed into useful forms of energy as plants do. An especially attractive approach is to store solar energy in the form of chemical bonds as performed in natural photosynthesis. Therefore, there is a challenge in the last decades to construct semi-artificial and artificial photosynthetic systems, which are able to efficiently capture and convert solar energy and then store it in the form of chemical bonds of solar fuels such as hydrogen or hydrogen peroxide, while at the time producing oxygen from water. Here, we review the molecular level details of the natural photosynthesis, particularly the mechanism of light dependent reactions in oxygen evolving organisms, absorption efficiency of solar energy and direct energy production. We then demonstrate the concept and examples of the semi-artificial photosynthesis in vitro. Finally we demonstrate the artificial photosynthesis, which is composed of light harvesting and charge-separation units together with catalytic units of water oxidation and reduction as well as CO2 reduction. The reported photosynthetic molecular and supramolecular systems have been designed and examined in order to mimic functions of the antenna-reaction center of the natural process. The relations between structures and photochemical behaviors of these artificial photosynthetic systems are discussed in relation to the rates and efficiencies of charge-separation and charge-recombination processes by utilizing the laser flash photolysis technique, as well as other complementary techniques. Finally the photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide as a more promising solar fuel is discussed in relation with the natural photosynthesis, which also produces hydrogen peroxide in addition to NADPH.",

     "abstract": "Aromatic bis(dicarboximides), abbreviated as bisimides or diimides, are interesting building blocks for the construction of electro- and photofunctional architectures. The possibility of reversible reduction of aromatic molecules equipped with imide units at modest redox potentials between about −1.3 and −1.0 V vs. the ferrocenium/ferrocene redox couple could be exploited by a broad variety of electroactive cyclophanes, macrocycles and catenane scaffolds to direct molecular motions by charging the systems with electrons. Whilst most of the work in this field has been accomplished for the smaller pyromellitic (PyBI) and naphthalene bisimides (NBI), the larger perylene bisimides (PBI) offered an entry into the field of photofunctional systems. Here cyclophanes with closely stacked PBI units provided insight into exciton coupling in homo and hetero dye dimers or ultrafast loss of coherence of the initially populated exciton states to give excimers or symmetry-broken charge separated states. In contrast, for PBI cyclophanes with larger cavities guest encapsulation could efficiently modulate the photophysical properties to give highly fluorescent host–guest complexes upon incorporation of electron-poor aromatic guest molecules or fully quenched systems upon incorporation of electron-rich molecules. For larger PBI macrocycles energy transfer processes could be investigated as well as the solvent-templated folding into double string ropes with high sensitivity (absorption, fluorescence) for the specific aromatic solvents. Finally, with a metallosupramolecular approach larger macrocycles (e.g. squares and hexagons) and cages (e.g. tetrahedrons) became accessible which could be exploited to study a variety of electro- and photophysical processes.",

Owing to immense efforts by numerous research groups, several strategies have been developed to design fluorescent sensors based on various components such as small molecules and fluorescent proteins. Recently, site-specific targeting of fluorescent sensors has attracted increasing attention. Strategies for fluorescent sensor targeting were surveyed in this review with the aims to expand current knowledge on chemistry-based bioimaging and aid in the emergence of related innovative technologies. The first discussed strategy is based on the intrinsic properties of small molecules for localization at specific organelles, such as mitochondria, nuclei, and lysosomes. As a further elaboration of the topic, our recent study about in vivo targeting of pH sensors was briefly introduced. The second strategy exploits genetically encoded tags and their specific ligands. Here, fluorescent sensors with commercially available tags and corresponding ligands were mainly reviewed. As the final topic, our original protein labeling technique, which enables fluorogenic labeling as an advanced technology, was introduced.",

     "abstract": "Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins can maintain and regulate cellular functions by accurately and quickly binding to target sequences among large amounts of nontarget DNA. The facilitated diffusion mechanism of DNA-binding proteins—a combination of three-dimensional (3D) diffusion and one-dimensional (1D) sliding along DNA—has been proposed to explain the target binding accuracy and rapidity and has been partially confirmed experimentally. Nonetheless, quantitative elucidation of the mechanism has remained difficult. Furthermore, many additional steps in facilitated diffusion have been proposed. In this review, we introduce the theoretical and experimental studies and the current understanding of facilitated diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. We focused on tumor suppressor p53 as a key protein subject to facilitated diffusion; p53 regulates various cellular processes such as cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis upon binding to a target sequence of DNA after activation by external stress to the cell. We describe the research on the 3D diffusion and 1D sliding of p53 mainly via single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. In addition to the demonstration of the 1D sliding of p53, recent experiments revealed multiple modes of 1D sliding, regulation of the target recognition, and the constant search distance despite changes in the concentrations of divalent cations. Furthermore, rotation-coupled 1D sliding along DNA is suggested. A comparison of parameters of the facilitated diffusion of p53 and those of other DNA-binding proteins characterized so far suggests that the ratio of 3D diffusion and 1D sliding is close to the theoretical optimum of 1:1 for several proteins including p53.",

     "abstract": "Modern laser-based spectroscopy has provided methods for detection ultrafast photochemical transformations occurring on the timescale of intramolecular and solvent reorganization. Such processes usually proceed in non-equilibrium regime, in parallel with nuclear relaxation, and often manifest strong deviations from the Kasha–Vavilov rule. In particular, they offer a possibility to control the yield of photoinduced electron transfer (ET) by using different excitation wavelengths. In the last decade the non-equilibrium charge transfer (CT) processes have attracted considerable interest from the scientific community due to their determining role in photosynthesis, dye-sensitized solar cells and various molecular electronic devices. Non-equilibrium of nuclear (intramolecular and solvent) degrees of freedom can be created by a pump pulse or by photoreaction itself at some of its stages. In this review both situations are considered and illustrated by examples in which non-equilibrium effects are pronounced. It is shown that ultrafast charge recombination in photoexcited donor–acceptor complexes and photochemical processes in donor–acceptor1–acceptor2 molecular compounds proceed predominantly in non-equilibrium (hot) regime. It is important that kinetics and product yields of these reactions demonstrate regularities that considerably differ from that observed in thermal reactions. Among them, the lack of the Marcus normal region in the free energy gap law for charge recombination of the excited donor–acceptor complexes, extremely low quantum yields of the thermalized charge separated states in ultrafast CT from the second excited state of the donor are most known. Although there have been many efforts to clarify microscopic mechanisms of non-equilibrium photoreactions by using ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy techniques, control of the rate and efficiency of photoinduced charge transfer reactions is still an open challenge. One of the most important applications here is a suppression of ultrafast charge recombination in CT systems, formed either by direct optical excitation or by the preceding ET step. In these systems charge recombination is often regarded as undesirable process, leading to the loss of energy and selectivity of photoreaction. In this review some strategies of ultrafast charge recombination suppression are discussed. The non-equilibrium effects are interpreted from a unified point of view in context of the multichannel point-transition stochastic model. This approach demonstrates similarities and differences in ET mechanisms in various donor–acceptor molecular systems and allows formulating general regularities inherent to these phenomena. We believe that new advances in this research area will not only help to discover new fundamental information about these regularities, but will also have impact on many emerging technologies where ultrafast CT plays the central role.",

The mechanistic details and spectrokinectic properties of the photogenerated colored intermediates have been extensively studied. Accordingly, stereoelectronic effects have been shown to play a crucial role in controlling properties such as spectrokinetics, fatigue resistance and colorability. Much research continues unabated to develop photochromic materials with properties that surpass the existing ones for application in ophthalmic lenses as well as optical data storage devices. In the realm of materials chemistry, the diarylpyran unit is presently exploited as an essential design element to produce functional materials. Given the facile synthetic access to molecular systems that respond to light as an external stimulus leading to widely distinct physicochemical properties, we believe that more exciting research based on diarylpyran photochemistry will germinate in materials chemistry and biology in the near future. This review with a coverage of the phenomenon since its inception to the present state of application for functional materials–through synthesis and mechanistic details–should serve as an invaluable resource to an uninhibited chemist to exploit the photochromism of diarylpyrans for diverse functions/applications.",

     "abstract": "Improving the performance of mostly employed anatase TiO2 photocatalysts by properly controlling their crystal shape represents a big challenge to improve their efficiency in photocatalytic applications. After the synthesis, reported in 2008, of anatase microcrystals enriched in high-energy {001} facets, many efforts have been made aimed at tuning the crystal morphology of anatase, by means of either fluorine-mediated or more environmentally friendly methods, producing a deviation from its regular crystal growth. In this relatively new field of investigation, controversial opinions emerged concerning the role of each type of facet and its relative amount in relation to photoefficiency optimization. This review addresses this topic by presenting a critical survey of selected literature reports. After a brief introduction on the main synthetic strategies adopted to obtain shape-controlled anatase photocatalysts, the attention is focused on the methods employed for their comprehensive characterization, including the identification and quantification of exposed facets and the assessment of their influence on bulk and surface properties relevant to photoactivity. Potential interferences, derived from synthetic routes and possibly affecting the conclusions of facet-dependent photoactivity investigations, are also discussed. Key examples of test reactions actually demonstrating how both the type and/or the amount of specific facets influence photocatalytic activity are finally reported, aiming at providing rational bases for the design of better performing shape-controlled anatase photocatalysts.",

     "abstract": "The key observation made by Acuña revealed the unusual optical properties of previously unknown 2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines (HPIPs). Although structurally similar to 2′-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazoles and 2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)benzimidazoles, 2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines exhibit strikingly different optical properties, especially in the solid state. The luminescence color of HPIPs depends on the polymorphic form and can be tailored from green to red. The inability to assume the neutral keto tautomer is their other distinct characteristic, setting them apart from analogous azoles and their benzoanalogs. For these azoles and related luminescent compounds, the dual emission in polar solvents is usually observed, dominated by excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) fluorescence. However, for 2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines, clear ESIPT emission exists only in non-polar solvents and it is very weak, while in polar and especially protic solvents, strong emission from the Franck-Condon state is exclusively observed. The solvent-related effect is attributed to the tendency to form strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the solid state and in non-polar solvents, while hydrogen bond formation is much weaker in polar, and especially, in protic solvents. The present study focuses on HPIPs and demonstrates that ESIPT process is a promising mechanism for packing-directed luminescence control and offers a novel design concept for tunable organic luminescent solids. This review presents not only optical properties in various solutions, but also in the solid state, and it is supported by a synthetic overview, computational studies, and the description of π-expanded derivatives.",

     "abstract": "The increasing global energy consumption and the simultaneous non-renewable resources depletion with their rising contamination levels, make the present energy scenario unsustainable. Among all the renewable energies, the sun's energy through its direct conversion into electricity is one of the best alternatives. In particular, since 1991 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable interest from the scientific and commercial communities due to their promising characteristics as solar light converters. Nevertheless, even though there have been many efforts to increase the photoconversion efficiency through the photovoltaic parameters improvement using novel materials and device construction approaches, the efficiency and stability are still open challenges. On this regard, several approaches and techniques are being used to analyze the dependence of the overall efficiency on these parameters. In particular, the fast and ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy techniques have provided advances towards unraveling the rate constants and quantum yields of the individual processes taking place in sensitized films in air as well as in complete DSSCs. Thus, the aim of this review is to discuss the main recent findings and the importance of the application of these techniques to understand why certain complete DSSC configurations have been more successful than others in terms of good sunlight conversion efficiencies, as well as to draw the basic guidelines on how to make further improvements in DSSCs. We firmly believe that new advances in this research area using ultrafast laser-based spectroscopy will not only help to discover fundamental and yet unknown information about these devices, but will also have impact on related topics like photocatalysis and photonics, supporting both technologies’ development and contributing to the growth of the fundamental knowledge on interactions among photons, electrons and materials.",

     "abstract": "The remarkable achievement by Fujishima and Honda (1972) in the photo-electrochemical water splitting results in the extensive use of TiO2 nanomaterials for environmental purification and energy storage/conversion applications. Though there are many advantages for the TiO2 compared to other semiconductor photocatalysts, its band gap of 3.2 eV restrains application to the UV-region of the electromagnetic spectrum (λ ≤ 387.5 nm). As a result, development of visible-light active titanium dioxide is one of the key challenges in the field of semiconductor photocatalysis. In this review, advances in the strategies for the visible light activation, origin of visible-light activity, and electronic structure of various visible-light active TiO2 photocatalysts are discussed in detail. It has also been shown that if appropriate models are used, the theoretical insights can successfully be employed to develop novel catalysts to enhance the photocatalytic performance in the visible region. Recent developments in theory and experiments in visible-light induced water splitting, degradation of environmental pollutants, water and air purification and antibacterial applications are also reviewed. Various strategies to identify appropriate dopants for improved visible-light absorption and electron–hole separation to enhance the photocatalytic activity are discussed in detail, and a number of recommendations are also presented.",

     "abstract": "Widespread implementation of renewable energy technologies, while preventing significant increases in greenhouse gas emissions, appears to be the only viable solution to meeting the world's energy demands for a sustainable energy future. The final energy mix will include conservation and energy efficiency, wind, geothermal, biomass, and others, but none more ubiquitous or abundant than the sun. Over several decades of development, the cost of photovoltaic cells has decreased significantly with lifetimes that exceed 25 years and there is promise for widespread implementation in the future. However, the solar input is intermittent and, to be practical at a truly large scale, will require an equally large capability for energy storage. One approach involves artificial photosynthesis and the use of the sun to drive solar fuel reactions for water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen or to reduce CO2 to reduced carbon fuels. An early breakthrough in this area came from an initial report by Honda and Fujishima on photoelectrochemical water splitting at TiO2 with UV excitation. Significant progress has been made since in exploiting semiconductor devices in water splitting with impressive gains in spectral coverage and solar efficiencies. An alternate, hybrid approach, which integrates molecular light absorption and catalysis with the band gap properties of oxide semiconductors, the dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cell (DSPEC), has been pioneered by the University of North Carolina Energy Frontier Research Center (UNC EFRC) on Solar Fuels. By utilizing chromophore-catalyst assemblies, core/shell oxide structures, and surface stabilization, the EFRC recently demonstrated a viable DSPEC for solar water splitting.",

     "abstract": "Carotenoids are essential pigments in natural photosynthesis. They absorb in the blue–green region of the solar spectrum and transfer the absorbed energy to (bacterio-)chlorophylls, and so expand the wavelength range of light that is able to drive photosynthesis. This process is an example of singlet–singlet energy transfer and so carotenoids serve to enhance the overall efficiency of photosynthetic light reactions. Carotenoids also act to protect photosynthetic organisms from the harmful effects of excess exposure to light. In this case, triplet–triplet energy transfer from (bacterio-)chlorophyll to carotenoid plays a key role in this photoprotective reaction. In the light-harvesting pigment–protein complexes from purple photosynthetic bacteria and chlorophytes, carotenoids have an additional role, namely the structural stabilization of those complexes. In this article we review what is currently known about how carotenoids discharge these functions. The molecular architecture of photosynthetic systems will be outlined to provide a basis from which to describe the photochemistry of carotenoids, which underlies most of their important functions in photosynthesis. Then, the possibility to utilize the functions of carotenoids in artificial photosynthetic light-harvesting systems will be discussed. Some examples of the model systems are introduced.",

However, the transformation of molecular WOCs to metal oxides/hydroxides or metal ions may occur under the harsh catalytic conditions, making the identification of true active species difficult. In this article, recent progress on molecular complexes acting as real catalysts or precursors toward water oxidation was briefly reviewed.

We discuss the correlations between the photophysics and the photochemistry of these complexes. The key reaction for PtIVCl62− is the inner-sphere electron transfer, which results in an Adamson radical pair that lives for several picoseconds, and the subsequent photoaquation in aqueous solutions and photoreduction in alcohols. The chlorine atom formed as the primary product escapes the solvent cage in aqueous solutions or oxidizes a solvent alcohol molecule via secondary electron transfer, producing secondary intermediates that react on the microsecond time scale. The photoexcitation of PtIVBr62− results in the formation of pentacoordinated PtIV intermediates, i.e. 3PtIVBr5− and 1PtIVBr5−, with characteristic lifetimes of approximately 1 and 10 ps, respectively. Subsequent reactions of these intermediates result in the complexation of a solvent molecule. Photoreduction is also possible in alcohols. Similar reactions occur with rather low quantum yields for IrIVCl62−, therefore, only the ground-state recovery could be monitored in ultrafast experiments, which occur on the 10-ps time scale. The photochemical behaviours of the IrIVBr62− and OsIVBr62− complexes are similar to those of IrIVCl62− and PtIVBr62−, respectively.",

     "abstract": "The continuous combustion of non-renewable fossil fuels and depletion of existing resources is intensifying the research and development of alternative future energy options that can directly abate and process ever-increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Since CO2 is a thermodynamically stable compound, its reduction must not consume additional energy or increase net CO2 emissions. Renewable sources like solar energy provide readily available and continuous light supply required for driving this conversion process. Therefore, the use of solar energy to drive CO2 photocatalytic reactions simultaneously addresses the aforementioned challenges, while producing sustainable fuels or chemicals suitable for use in existing energy infrastructure. Recent progress in this area has focused on the development and testing of promising TiO2 based photocatalysts in different reactor configurations due to their unique physicochemical properties for CO2 photoreduction. TiO2 nanostructured materials with different morphological and textural properties modified by using organic and inorganic compounds as photosensitizers (dye sensitization), coupling semiconductors of different energy levels or doping with metals or non-metals have been tested. This review presents contemporary views on state of the art in photocatalytic CO2 reduction over titanium oxide (TiO2) nanostructured materials, with emphasis on material design and reactor configurations. In this review, we discuss existing and recent TiO2 based supports, encompassing comparative analysis of existing systems, novel designs being employed to improve selectivity and photoconversion rates as well as emerging opportunities for future development, crucial to the field of CO2 photocatalytic reduction. The influence of different operating and morphological variables on the selectivity and efficiency of CO2 photoreduction is reviewed.

Therefore, with the objective of emphasising the implications of photoexcited (charge) carrier transport, here we review recent efforts indicating the significance of electrode design to enhance the performance of PEC biosensor with semiconductor photocatalytic materials. Besides enzymatic PEC biosensors, the underlying beneficial mechanism of direct oxidisation of biomolecules onto a wide range of semiconductor photocatalyst surfaces by the photogenerated holes is briefly discussed. This review is primarily divided into three parts: materials, signal amplification, and promising device architectures, based on recent advances in PEC biosensors. In addition, this review outlines the strategies used to detect a wide range of bioanalytes. After a summary of PEC sensing architectures, the review concludes with an outlook and the current challenges in fabricating solar-light-driven and self-powered biosensors using nanostructured photocatalytic semiconductors.

Non- or weakly emissive molecules are induced to emit efficiently through nanoaggregate formation, which are referred to as aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE), respectively. A large number of AIE/AIEE active organic molecules have now been developed and reviews on them appeared. Comparatively little attempt is made on the AIEE activity based on organometallic and coordination complexes. In the case of most of the transition metal complexes intersystem crossing from the excited S1 to T1 state is close to unity and predominant emission process is phosphorescence. This review concentrates on the design, synthesis, and photophysical behavior and important applications of aggregation-induced phosphorescence enhancement (AIPE)-active molecules based on transition metal complexes. Researchers have incorporated a rotating or isomerizable or long alkyl chain unit in the ligand or cyclometalated ligand, to generate a family of AIPE active members. Several transition metal complexes including Re(I), Ir(III), Pt(II), Au(I), Zn(II) and Cu(I) have been demonstrated to exhibit a significant AIPE phenomenon in the presence of appropriate stimuli. The phosphorescence intensity and quantum yield could be enhanced by adding poor solvents to induce nanoaggregate formation to restrict the intramolecular rotation or isomerization.

     "abstract": "Contemporary photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the last-line treatment of refractory cancers such as nasopharyngeal carcinomas, superficial recurrent urothelial carcinomas, and non-resectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas yields poor clinical outcomes and may be associated with adverse events. This is mainly attributable to three factors: (1) the currently employed photosensitizers exhibit suboptimal spectral properties, (2) the route of administration is associated with unfavorable photosensitizer pharmacokinetics, and (3) the upregulation of survival pathways in tumor cells may impede cell death after PDT. Consequently, there is a strong medical need to improve PDT of these recalcitrant cancers. An increase in PDT efficacy and reduction in clinical side-effects may be achieved by encapsulating second-generation photosensitizers into liposomes that selectively target to pharmacologically important tumor locations, namely tumor cells, tumor endothelium, and tumor interstitial spaces. In addition to addressing the drawbacks of clinically approved photosensitizers, this review addresses the most relevant pharmacological aspects that dictate clinical outcome, including photosensitizer biodistribution and intracellular localization in relation to PDT efficacy, the mechanisms of PDT-induced cell death, and PDT-induced antitumor immune responses. Also, a rationale is provided for the use of second-generation photosensitizers such as diamagnetic phthalocyanines (e.g., zinc or aluminum phthalocyanine), which exhibit superior photophysical and photochemical properties, in combination with a multi-targeted liposomal photosensitizer delivery system. The rationale for this PDT platform is corroborated by preliminary experimental data and proof-of-concept studies. Finally, a summary of the different nanoparticulate photosensitizer delivery systems is provided followed by a section on phototriggered release mechanisms in the context of liposomal photosensitizer delivery systems.",

     "abstract": "The development of biologically templated artificial light harvesting antennae and energy transfer devices is a highly active research area with exceptional challenges. Natural energy harvesting complexes have exquisite spectrally- and spatially-tuned systems with high redundancy to maximize their ability to gather, channel, and distribute electromagnetic radiation. Attempting to mimic these highly efficient systems requires at the very least (sub)nanoscale precision in the positioning of light sensitive molecules, the latter of which must also possess carefully selected photophysical properties; in essence, these two fundamental properties must be exploited in a synergistic manner. First, the scaffold must be highly organized, ideally with multiple symmetrical components that are spatially arranged with nanoscale accuracy. Second, the structure must be amenable to chemical modification in order to be (bio)functionalized with the desired light sensitive moieties which have expanded greatly to now include organic dyes, metal chelates, fluorescent proteins, dye-doped and noble metal nanoparticles, photoactive polymers, along with semiconductor quantum dots amongst others. Several families of biological scaffolding molecules offer strong potential to meet these stringent requirements. Recent advances in bionanotechnology have provided the ability to assemble diverse naturally derived scaffolds along with manipulating their properties and this is allowing us to understand the capabilities and limitations of such artificial light-harvesting antennae and devices. The range of scaffold or template materials that have been used varies from highly symmetrical virus capsids to self-assembled biomaterials including nucleic acids and small peptides as well as a range of hybrid inorganic–biological systems. This review surveys the burgeoning field of artificial light-harvesting and energy transfer complexes that utilize biological scaffolds from the perspective of what each has to offer for optimized energy transfer. We highlight each biological scaffold with prominent examples from the literature and discuss some of the benefits and liabilities of each approach. Cumulatively, the available data suggest that DNA is the most versatile biological material currently available, though it has challenges including precise dye placement and subsequent dye performance. We conclude by providing a perspective on how this field will progress in both the short and long term, with a focus on the transition to applications and devices.",

     "abstract": "‘Supramolecular photochemistry’ (SP) deals with a study of the properties of molecules in their excited states where the medium plays a significant role. While ‘molecular photochemistry’ (MP) deals with studies in isotropic solution, the SP deals with reactant molecules that interact weakly with their surroundings. The surroundings in general are highly organized assemblies such as crystals, liquid crystals, micelles, and host–guest structures. The behavior of exited molecules in SP unlike in isotropic solution is controlled not only by their inherent electronic and steric properties but also by the immediate surroundings. The weak interactions that control the chemistry include van der Walls, hydrophobic, CH⋯π, π⋯π and several types of hydrogen bonds. In this review the uniqueness of SP compared to MP is highlighted with examples chosen from reactions in crystals, micelles and host–guest assemblies. In spite of distinctly different structures (crystals, micelles, etc.) the influence of the medium could be understood on the basis of a model developed by G.M.J. Schmidt for photoreactions in crystals. The principles of reaction cavity model are briefly outlined in this review. There are a few important features that are specific to SP. For example, highly reactive molecules and intermediates could be stabilized in a confined environment; they enable phosphorescence to be observed at room temperature and favor chiral induction in photochemical reactions. Using such examples the uniqueness of SP is highlighted. The future of SP depends on developing efficient and unique catalytic photoreactions using easily available reaction ‘containers’. In addition, their value in artificial photosynthesis should be established for SP to occupy a center stage in the future.",

     "abstract": "The “Excited-State Intramolecular Proton Transfer” (ESIPT) reactions in a number of organic fluorophores are among the fastest basic chemical reactions known so far and their rates can be observed even on femtosecond time scale. Accordingly, the reactant concentration, as monitored by its emission, should be negligibly small. In sharp contrast to this conventional wisdom, however, the coexistence of the reactant and the product of this reaction is so frequently observed in condensed media. We then discuss two possible origins of these effects: when the ESIPT reaction is perturbed and hence is slow on the time scale of emission (kinetic control) or when the reverse reaction repopulating the reactant state is fast and leads to the excited-state equilibrium (thermodynamic control). Upon reviewing a great number of ESIPT prototypical systems, we summarize and discuss different criteria for distinguishing these cases based on the steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic studies and derive correlations between reversibility of these reactions and the solvent-dependent effects observed in fluorescence spectra.",

The photosynthetic energy conversion forms the basis for all the existing life today. The photosynthetic energy is being harnessed in many ways using modern technologies for the production of fuels using photosynthetic organisms, generation of direct electricity using photosystems/photosynthetic organisms in photo-bioelectrochemical cells or through photovoltaic systems. While the production of energy rich carbon fuels (ethanol, propanol) from photosynthetic organisms has already been accomplished due to advancement in understanding microbial physiology and metabolism, the photosynthetic hydrogen production as well as direct electricity generation from light is still at its infancy. Recent advances include combining photosystem complexes with hydrogenases for hydrogen production, using isolated thylakoids, photosystems on nanostructured electrodes such as gold nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, ZnO nanoparticles for electricity generation. Many challenging optimizations on the immobilization methods, catalyst stability and isolation procedures, electron transfer strategies have acquired momentum leading to the production of more stable and higher current densities and power densities in photosynthetic devices. Further, the use of whole cell microorganisms (cyanobacteria, microalgae) rather than their isolated counterparts has produced promising results. The photosynthetic energy conversion has an enormous potential for renewable energy generation in a sustainable and environment friendly manner.",

The photoprocess causes cell death through irreversible oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species produced by the interaction between a photosensitizing compound and a light source.With great emphasis on the environmental area, photodynamic inactivation (PDI) has been tested in insect eradication and in water disinfection. Lately, other studies have been carried out concerning its possible use in aquaculture waters or to the control of food-borne pathogens. Other potential applications of PDI in household, industrial and hospital settings have been considered.In the last decade, scientific research in this area has gained importance not only due to great developments in the field of materials chemistry but also because of the serious problem of the increasing number of bacterial species resistant to common antibiotics. In fact, the design of antimicrobial surfaces or self-cleaning materials is a very appealing idea from the economic, social and public health standpoints. Thus, PDI of micro(organisms) represents a promising alternative.In this review, the efforts made in the last decade in the investigation of PDI of (micro)organisms with potential applications beyond the medical field will be discussed, focusing on porphyrins, free or immobilized on solid supports, as photosensitizing agents.",

It has been established recently that doping of titanium dioxides with 2p-, 3p-, 6p- and 3d-elements significantly increases their photocatalytic activity. In this review we summarize calculation results on the electronic structure and optical properties of bulk stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric rutile and anatase and their doped compounds obtained by means of ab initio methods of condensed matter physics: the linearized muffin-tin orbital method, the linearized augmented plane-wave method, the plane-wave pseudopotential method, the coherent potential method, the Hartree–Fock method, etc. The possibilities and restrictions of the methods for accurate calculations of the electronic structure and optical properties of stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric titanium dioxides and titanium dioxides doped with 2p-, 3p-, 6p- and 3d-elements are discussed. As calculated with the included Coulomb correlation correction, within the hybrid potential approximation or with the self-interaction correction taken into account, the electronic structure and optical spectrum are in agreement with the experimental data.

     "abstract": "The cryptochrome/photolyase superfamily is a class of flavoproteins that can regulate the growth and development in plants, as well as the circadian clock and the potential magnetic navigation in animals, primarily by absorbing UV-A and blue light. It is generally agreed that these functions depend on the photochemical reaction of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) chromophore, non-covalently binding to cryptochromes or photolyases. Irradiation can initiate either photoreduction between FAD and certain electron donors or electron jumping in FAD, thereby leading to the generation of intermediates that activate the protein. This signaling process is known as photoactivation. Subsequently, the activated protein will interact with downstream receptors to transfer the photo and magnetic signals. Based on in-depth research on photoactivation, two photo-cycle mechanisms for the photoreception/photosignaling of the cryptochrome/photolyase superfamily, i.e., the photolyase model and the phototropin model, have been proposed. There is no apparent alternative to the photo-cycle of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) or (6-4) photolyase following the photolyase model. However, the mechanism is not clear for the photoactivation of cryptochromes and CRY-DASH, a new subcategory of photolyase. Since the photoactivation process is the first step for the physiological function of proteins, more and improved research efforts in this field have been widely developed. This review first briefly presents the structure, the photoactivation, and the repair mechanism of CPD and (6-4) photolyase. Next, we review in detail the photoactivation of cryptochromes and CRY-DASH by analyzing the current status of research, as well as the contradictions in the resting redox states of FAD, intermediates in photoreactions, the photo-cycle of FAD, the signaling state of proteins, and the necessity of given tryptophans for protein activity. Based on these studies, the correlations of photoactivation and photo-cycle mechanisms, as well as the correlations of photoactivation and magnetoreception of proteins, are discussed. Finally the crucial open questions regarding the photoactivation mechanisms of the cryptochrome/photolyase superfamily are outlined, considering the hypothesis for a cryptochrome-based model of avian magnetoreception.",

Trimers offer a richer spectrum of options for coupling between particles, which can be analyzed using group theory to obtain the plasmonic modes, in analogy to vibrational modes.

The deeper understanding is in urgent need for the development of novel plasmonic photocatalysts.

Recently, the research fields of EM enhancement entered a new regime wherein the enhancement effects are connected to photochemical and photobiological phenomena. For this regime, the conventional theorem used to understand the EM enhancement effect should be re-examined because the experimental conditions are beyond the assumptions in the theorem. Thus, in this review, we firstly overview and summarize the EM mechanism in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), which is the most general optical response using an EM enhancement, and determine the limitations and problems of the EM mechanism in SERS. Secondly, we discuss the necessity of re-examining the EM mechanism with respect to three breakdowns of the approximations in Fermi's golden rule: the breakdown of the molecular electronic dynamics by the ultra-fast plasmonic de-excitation, the breakdown of the weak coupling between the plasmon and molecular exciton by strong EM enhancement, and the breakdown of the selection rule of SERS by the field-gradient effect.

The purpose of this work is to review recent studies in one largely unexplored area of nanobiotechnology: the development of nano-bio hybrid materials that exploit Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to enhance the functionalities of technologically promising photosynthetic biomaterials. One of very promising approaches is to employ semiconductor quantum dots having a broad absorption spectrum as nanoantennae coupled with the natural light-harvesting complexes of photosynthetic reaction centers. This system reveals great potential for the utilization of quantum dots in artificial photosynthetic devices. The second very useful functionality, which is discussed in this review, is the possibility to enhance the efficiency of the main biological function (proton pumping) of the protein bacteriorhodopsin using nonradiative energy transfer from quantum dots. Also recent studies revealed that FRET-based improvement of the biological function of bacteriorhodopsin in the presence of quantum dots allows for strong wavelength-dependent enhancement of the nonlinear refractive index of bacteriorhodopsin. These new hybrid bio-nanomaterials with exceptional light-harvesting and nonlinear properties will have numerous photonic applications employing their photochromic, energy transfer, and energy conversion properties.",

Alternatively, the host photocatalyst may also contribute to antimicrobial activity observed in the absence of irradiation, such as for AgX (X = Cl, Br, I) and ZnO. These silver-modified composites present a novel class of hybrid photocatalysts, which possess antibacterial and/or antiviral action in both dark and light conditions, and are discussed in detail in this review. In addition, other antimicrobial photocatalysts such as those based on copper are examined.

The present article resumes photochemical reactions used for the preparation of these compounds. A very important and generally applicable reaction used for the synthesis of helicenes and helicene-like compounds is the photocyclization of stilbene subunits followed by oxidation. This reaction is often highly regioselective. The reaction can be conducted in the way that the formation of the helicene structure is favored. This selectivity is caused by the sum of the free valence numbers in the different positions of the stilbene precursor. Very fascinating structures are obtained with the cobalt catalyzed Vollhardt reaction which is photolytically supported. Helicenes are chiral and different methods of asymmetric synthesis were applied to the preparation of these compounds. A very convenient method is optical resolution using HPLC which is now currently used.",

Thus, hybridization of CNTs with functional components that specifically recognize various chemical and biomolecular analytes is often necessary in the preparation of CNT-based sensors. In this review, we summarize preparation and photophysical properties of CNT-based composites, and then highlight on fluorescence sensors based on CNT-composites. These composite sensors integrate the signal transduction property of CNT and the recognition properties of the hybridized functional components. The functional components selectively bind with the target analytes, whereas, CNTs transform the binding events into output signals detectable using spectrofluorometer.

     "abstract": "Hydrogen gas is chemical fuel with high energy density, and represents a clean, renewable and carbon-free burning fuel, which has the potential to solve the more and more urgent energy crisis in today's society. Inspired by natural photosynthesis, artificial photosynthesis to generate hydrogen energy has attracted a lot of attentions in the field of chemistry, physics and material. Photoelectrochemical water splitting based on semiconductors represents a green and low cost method to generate hydrogen fuel. However, solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency is quite low, due to some intrinsic limitations such as bandgap, diffusion distance, carrier lifetime and photostability of semiconductors. Although nanostructured photoelectrodes improve the photoelectrochemical water splitting performance to some extent, by increasing electrolyte accessible area and shortening minority carrier diffusion distance, nanostructure engineering cannot change their intrinsic electronic properties. More importantly, recent development in chemically modification of nanostructured electrodes, including surface modification with catalyst and plasmonic metallic structures, element doping and incorporation of functional heterojunctions, have led to significant enhancements in the efficiencies of charge separation, transport, collection and solar energy harvesting. In this review, we provide an overview of the recent process in photoelectrochemical water splitting by using chemically modified nanostructured photoelectrodes.

     "abstract": "Hydrogen generated through the photochemical cleavage of water using renewable solar energy is considered to be an environmentally friendly chemical fuel of the future, which neither results in air pollution nor leads to the emission of greenhouse gases. The photocatalytic materials for water cleavage are required to perform at least two fundamental functions: light harvesting of the maximal possible part of the solar energy spectrum and a catalytic function for efficient water decomposition into oxygen and hydrogen. Photocatalytic systems based on colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals offer a number of advantages in comparison with photoelectrochemical cells based on bulk electrodes: (i) a broad range of material types are available; (ii) higher efficiencies are expected due to short distance charge transport; (iii) large surface areas are beneficial for the catalytic processes; (iv) flexibility in fabrication and design which also allows for tuning of the electronic and optical properties by employing quantum confinement effects. The presence of co-catalysts on colloidal semiconductors is an important part of the overall design of the photocatalytic colloidal systems necessary to maximize the water splitting efficiency. This review article discusses the rational choice of colloidal nanoheterostructured materials based on light-harvesting II–VI semiconductor nanocrystals combined with a variety of metal and/or non-metal co-catalysts, with optimized light harvesting, charge separation, and photocatalytic functions.",

     "abstract": "Tetrazoles exhibit a very rich photochemistry, strongly influenced by the nature of substituents in the tetrazolic ring. Photolysis of representative tetrazoles trapped in a rigid environment of solidified noble gases at cryogenic temperatures (usually argon at 10–15 K) results in photofragmentation of the monomeric species with a wide range of exit channels. Since the obtained fragments are generally confined to the matrix cage where they are formed, no subsequent cross-reactions involving species resulting from photolysis can occur, strongly reducing the number of possible photoproducts in comparison with gas phase or solution studies. These conditions introduce a useful simplification for the interpretation of the reaction mechanisms and enable spectroscopic characterization of novel and/or highly reactive molecules. In this review, we provide an updated report on the photolysis of matrix-isolated tetrazoles, focusing on the scope and usefulness of this methodology for generation of rare molecules and investigation of photocleavage pathways. Special emphasis is placed on mechanistic interpretations and characterization of rare molecules and on the relevance of conformation and tautomerism on the photochemistry of the studied compounds.",

These precursors are generally more soluble and stable than the corresponding acene compounds, and their quantitative conversion can be achieved simply by photoirradiation both in solution and in the solid state. Further, the irreversible photoinduced removal of the α-diketone unit can be used to alter the optoelectronic properties of fluorophores.

A great number of modification methods of semiconductor photocatalysts have been developed and investigated to accelerate the photoconversion, to enable the absorption of visible light, or to alter the reaction mechanism to control the products and intermediates. In this regard, various modification methods of TiO2 are classified according to the kind of surface modifiers (metal-loading, impurity doping, inorganic adsorbates, polymer coating, dye-sensitization, charge transfer complexation) and their effects on photocatalytic reaction mechanism and kinetics are discussed in detail. Modifying TiO2 in various ways not only changes the mechanism and kinetics under UV irradiation but also introduces visible light activity that is absent with pure TiO2. Each modification method influences the photocatalytic activity and mechanism in a way different from others and the observed modification effects are often different depending on the test substrates and conditions even for the same modification method. Better understanding of the modification effects on TiO2 photocatalysis is necessary to obtain reliable results, to assess the photoconversion efficiency more quantitatively, and to further improve the modification methods.",

     "abstract": "To study plasmon-induced charge transfer mechanism between an excited gold nanoparticle (NP) and a TiO2 NP, which can be applied to solar cell and photocatalyst technologies, ultrafast femtosecond visible-pump/infrared-probe transient absorption spectroscopy was utilized to explore charge separation and recombination dynamics in gold–TiO2 NP systems. In this review, our recent works are summarized. TiO2 NPs of different diameters were chosen as electron acceptors for a gold NP donor with a 10-nm diameter. Electron transfer from gold NPs to the conduction band of TiO2 was observed by the transient absorption of electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 at 3440 nm after optical excitation of the surface plasmon band of gold NPs. By using a reference of Ru-complex dye sensitized TiO2 film, the occurrence of ultrafast electron injection from gold NPs to TiO2 NP film was clearly proved. It was found that electron injection was completed within 50 fs and the electron injection yield reached 20–50% under 550 nm excitation. The excitation wavelength dependence between 400 and 680 nm suggested that there were two pathways for the injection: one was through direct electron-hole generation, and the other seemed to relate to enhanced electric field by plasmon. The charge recombination decay within 1.5 ns was nonexponential and strongly dependent on the particle diameter of TiO2. Larger TiO2 particles resulted in longer charge recombination times because of the longer diffusion length of electrons in TiO2 particles. Also, two-photon absorption cross-section of the 10-nm gold NP at a near-infrared wavelength (1200 nm) was estimated to be as large as 108 GM (1 GM = 10−50 cm4 s photon−1 molecule−1).",

     "abstract": "Measurement and evaluation methods for the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), of which the mechanism for photocurrent generation is quite different from that of silicon-type solar cells, are reviewed here and a relevant method proposed. The slow response times and nonlinearity of DSC photocurrents against the light intensity (irradiance) at wavelengths of incident light are profoundly influenced by their characteristic working principles since photocurrent generation for DSCs is more complicated than for Si-type solar cells. DSCs work not only by the physical process of an electron in solid-state TiO2 but also diffusion processes in the fluid electrolytes in contrast to only the simple solid-state physical process of a charge separation at the p–n junction of the interface for Si-type solar cells. In addition, newly developed DSCs are prepared by such elemental materials as sensitizers, electrolytes and semiconductors of diverse morphologies. In this respect, it is essential to establish a comprehensive and relevant method for the correct spectral measurement of the responsivity and performance of a wide range of DSCs which may include cells involving various kinds of electrolytic media. In this review, DSC electrolyte media with such disparate viscosities as a typical organic solvent, 3-methoxypropionitrile (Cell A), or an ionic liquid (Cell B) are introduced and analytical methods such as the AC method is compared with the DC method to gauge spectral responsivity. IPCE measurements were carried out by adjusting the chopping frequency low enough to obtain a steady state current under illumination conditions similar to those under practical use. Our studies revealed that when sufficient time is allowed for complete photocurrent generation, especially for DSCs involving an ionic liquid, I–V measurements which take this time allowance into consideration show them to perform satisfactorily. In fact, in an extreme example, I–V measurements of a DSC with an ionic liquid electrolyte can take over 50 min before correct data can be obtained. Thus, standards for the evaluation of DSCs need to be established separately from those for Si-type solar cells to avoid incorrect and incomplete comparisons.",

In order to unravel the mysteries of gas phase photocatalytic reaction pathways, in situ techniques must be used to allow the detection and identification of reaction intermediates on a working catalyst. Several techniques were already used in the past, of which Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy seems to be the most versatile.

The removal rate of gaseous or aqueous contaminants is influenced by numerous parameters; UV light intensity, substrate concentration, O2 partial pressure, humidity, substrate type, and so on. Moreover, TiO2 photocatalyst essentially has a difficulty in decomposition of large amount of contaminants or refractory chemicals. As the solutions of these problems, combination with other processes such as advanced oxidation processes and improvement of the design of photocatalytic environmental purification systems are described. During the past several years, the strategies for effective design of the system are well discussed and evaluated.

The theory predicts that mutual orientation, the number of dyes in the cluster, and combinations of different dyes should display given characteristic spectroscopic behaviors due to coherent interactions. Comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental results has been limited so far. One of the reasons is the absence of a rigid and well-organized system that can control the orientation and size of the dye assembly. Recently, the DNA duplex has been used to assemble chromophores in a programmed manner. Use of DNA allows organized dye assembly with a given size and particular orientation.

They are classified into three groups: (i) DNA-templated molecular/ion assemblies; (ii) DNA-directed complexation; and (iii) chemical transformations accelerated on DNA.",

     "abstract": "Nowadays, time-resolved spectroscopy data can be routinely and accurately collected in UV–vis femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. However, the data analysis strategy and the postulation of a physically valid model for this kind of measurements may be tackled with many different approaches ranging from pure soft-modeling (model-free) to hard-modeling, where the elaboration of a parametric spectro-temporal model may be required. This paper reviews methods that are used in practice for the analysis of femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy data. Model-based methods, common in photochemistry, are revisited, and soft-modeling methods, which originate from the chemometrics field and that recently disseminated in the photo(bio)chemistry literature, are presented. These soft-modeling methods are designed to suit the intrinsic nature of the multivariate (or multi-way) measurement. Soft-modeling tools do not require a priori physical or mechanistic models to provide a decomposition of the data on the time and wavelength dimensions, the only requirement being that these two (or more) dimensions are separable. Additionally, Bayesian data analysis, which provides a probabilistic framework for data analysis, is considered in detail, since it allows uncertainty quantification and validation of the model selection step.",

On the application side, we focus on material fabrication and processing that beat diffraction-limited resolution. Together, we will shed a light on the essence of research activities carried out in the past 10 years.

These compounds are generally characterized as fluorescent dyes and exhibit poor efficiency in intersystem crossing in direct excitation. However, a few studies have reported that the intersystem crossing is strongly induced by the following methodologies: presence of heavy atoms including metal ions; presence of radical substituents; charge recombination of the generated charge separated states; and hyperfine interactions in long-separated radical pairs. These methodologies are useful to selectively generate locally excited triplet states or charge separated states with minimal loss of deactivation to the singlet ground states.

Fluorine atom insertion to their structures belongs to one of many ongoing approaches for improving their potency. The presence of fluorine in the structure of a photosensitizer may enrich it with required pharmacokinetic features. Photostability, high level of singlet oxygen production, lipophilicity and selective accumulation in tumor cells have made the fluorinated porphyrinoids potential entities for photodynamic therapy. Moreover, photosensitizers possessing intrinsic fluorescence may be applied as agents in photodynamic diagnosis of cancer. Noteworthy, magnetic resonance of fluorinated compounds constitutes excellent probe for sensitive and minimally invasive imaging.Porphyrins constitute the largest group within fluorinated porphyrinoids of potential anticancer and antimicrobial properties. Skillful combination of fluorine substituents with other functional groups in their structures, including glycol or sugars led to novel molecules possessing outstanding phototoxicity in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Furthermore, fluorinated porphyrins were researched as biomimetic systems imitating the active sites of some enzymes. Fluorinated chlorins are considered as promising photosensitizers due to a strong absorption and the least harmful effects to human tissues. Fluorine containing groups introduced to the periphery of phthalocyanines improved their solubility in common solvents and thus enhanced applications in in vitro and in vivo researches. Lately investigated porphyrinoids belonging to corroles showed on one hand potential as photosensitizers, but on the other hand they were found as catalytic anti-oxidants for attenuation of diabetes mellitus.",

We analyze examples that illustrate changes in refractive index, transmission of polarized light, reflectivity, light dispersion, polarization, charge transport capability, dielectrical properties, stable phase, microscopic surface relief in large areas, hydrophobicity of the surface, permeability, and even bulk mechanical deformations. The basis of such changes at a molecular level is associated with a difference in the shape, dipole moment, polarizability, or electronic features of the photochromic species, and their different interaction with the environment. In some cases, studies were performed at the single molecule level. Each effect is discussed stressing the favorable features of the particular photochromic compounds to induce the changes and its interaction with the environment that make it suitable for the appointed application.",

     "abstract": "It is now clear for the first time that photochemistry can compete with vibrational relaxation within a singlet state. This possibility has not been generally considered, or believed possible, prior to the considerations given herein. It is also evident that both the nature of the vibrational/vibronic mode and the vibrational level excited within a given mode can markedly affect the experimentally determined quantum yields of photochemistry ΦPC(n) and fluorescence ΦF(n) in multi-atom systems, where n is the nth level. There is not just one quantum yield of fluorescence (F) or photochemistry (PC), but there are many that can exist. Since the yields of PC depend on the vibrational/vibronic level excited, the new concepts of ΦV and ΦPC inevitably arise ΦV = kV/(kV + kPC) and ΦPC = kPC/(kPC + kV). ΦPC measures the efficiency of photochemistry from a given level within a given mode in competition with vibrational relaxation between the given level and a lower one. ΦV measures the efficiency of vibrational relaxation between a given level and a lower one. The magnitude of the photochemical yield is largely dictated by the nature of the mode excited within a given electronic state as well as the level that is excited. ΦV and ΦPC have no parallel in previously existing experimental or theoretical photophysics/photochemistry. In general, relaxation from the 0 level of an upper state Sx (x = 2, 3, …) does not occur via vibrational levels of any lower energy states.",

     "abstract": "Photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using semiconductor materials has attracted considerable interest due to its potential to cleanly produce H2 from water by utilizing abundant solar light. Since Fujishima and Honda used a TiO2 photoanode in 1972 to split water, researchers have been attempting to develop water-splitting systems that can efficiently use visible light (which accounts for almost half of the solar spectrum on the Earth's surface) in order to realize efficient conversion of solar light. In this report, we review recent progress in this field by focusing on strategies that utilize visible light. Such strategies include two-step photoexcitation systems that were inspired by photosynthesis in nature, band engineering for producing novel photocatalysts that have both a high visible light absorption and suitable energy levels for water splitting, the development of new cocatalysts for efficient H2 or O2 production, fabrication of efficient photoelectrodes based on visible-light-responsive semiconductors, and the construction of tandem-type PEC water-splitting systems.",

Its absorption and fluorescence behavior from different prototropic species show remarkable sensitivity towards the polarity, viscosity and local pH, exhibited by various microheterogeneous bio and biomimetic environments like micelles, reverse micelles, proteins, etc. The significant results obtained for NHM in homogeneous and a series of microheterogeneous environments is reviewed in this account. Much attention has been given to the properties of the excited states, location and biodistribution of NHM in different biological environments. The results can help in understanding the photophysics of the probe in biological environments and in assessing the correlation between different prototropic forms and biological activity.",

     "abstract": "The photosensitized electron-transfer processes in the rotaxane hybrids composed with electron-accepting fullerenes and various electron-donors placed in the rotaxanes are revealed with time-resolved fluorescence and absorption spectral methods. Porphyrins are most useful as light-harvesting donors and photosensitizing donors. In addition, aromatic amines and ferrocene act as electron-donor and also hole-shifting reagents in multi-component rotaxanes. In the rotaxanes with spatially placed donor-acceptor molecules, the role of triplet states becomes important compared with the covalently connected donor–acceptor molecular systems, which may be related to the “through-space” and “through-bond” electron transfer, respectively. In the designed multi-component rotaxanes which maintain mechanically or topologically the electron-acceptor, electron-donor, and hole-shifter, the photoinduced electron transfer, hole-shift, electron–hole recombination are established. As a whole, contribution of the triplet excited states is prominent compared with the covalently bonded molecules and supramolecular systems constructed with coordination bonds.",

By these enzymes, e− and H+ recombine and form molecular hydrogen. Hydrogenase activity can be very high but is extremely sensitive to the photosynthetically evolved O2 that leads to reduced and unstable H2 production. However, presently, several approaches are developed to improve the energetic efficiency to generate H2. This review examines the main available pathways to improve the photosynthetic H2 production.",

In particular, we describe and illustrate the possible advantages of microwaves in TiO2-assisted photodegradations and photomineralizations of various organic pollutants such as herbicides and endocrine disruptors, among others. Described are also various reactor configurations involving UV/visible radiation and microwaves, with the former being supplied either by traditional Hg lamps or alternatively by electrodeless lamps activated by microwaves. To place the use of microwaves on processes occurring in aqueous TiO2 dispersions in perspective regarding environmental applications, we first introduce the various sources of pollutants and subsequently describe in brief the various advanced oxidation processes such as UV/peroxidation, UV/ozonation and the photo-Fenton process(es) in addition to direct photolysis either by sunlight or by artificial light sources.",

     "abstract": "Photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes play important roles in the early events in photosynthesis in nature, and have been studied by various spectroscopic methodologies. Single molecule spectroscopy is one of the recent powerful methods to study fine electronic structures of photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes without averaging over an ensemble of the complexes. In this review, we focus on spectroscopic properties of single light-harvesting complexes in anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. In single supramolecule spectroscopy of light-harvesting complexes of purple photosynthetic bacteria, information on excitonic (de)localization on the arrangements of bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) a molecules, which is hidden in conventional measurements, has been obtained in detail. Single supramolecule spectroscopy has been applied to major antenna complexes (=chlorosomes) in green photosynthetic bacteria, revealing the spectral properties in relation to anisotropy and excitation energy transfer in single chlorosomes, their heterogeneity, and the number of BChl molecules per chlorosome.",

     "publication date": "03-2010",
     "abstract": "Azobenzene derivatives are very attractive for light-driven experiments, due to their easy trans/cis isomerization, which is one of the cleanest photochemical processes known to date. Azobenzenes have been linked in various places to the structure of dendrimers and dendrons. The azobenzene groups can constitute the terminal functions of the dendrimers (or dendrons); a single azobenzene can be located at the core of a dendron or a dendrimer; finally, several azobenzene groups can be incorporated at one or several layers of dendrimers or dendrons. The first part of this review is an exhaustive compilation of all these types of azobenzene-containing dendritic structures.Most dendritic macromolecules possessing azobenzenes in their structure were synthesized with the aim of studying their photo-responsive properties. The influence of the placement of azobenzene groups on the isomerization properties was determined in solution: generally, burying the azobenzene inside the structure induces reluctance to isomerization, especially when the generation increases, but has a larger influence on the size modification. Several dendritic azobenzenes were also studied as thin films, in particular monolayer Langmuir and Langmuir–Blodgett films. Photo-induced alignment was observed for thin films obtained by spin-coating, others were used for holographic experiments. Self-arrangements of photo-responsive dendrimers have resulted in liquid crystalline organizations, vesicles, nano-fibers, and organogels. In addition to these particular properties, some more practical uses were reported such as for molecular imprinting, to trap/release guest molecules, or for drug delivery by cleavage of the NN bond.",
