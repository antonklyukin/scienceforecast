     "abstract": "The Arabidopsis ECERIFERUM1 (CER1) protein is a decarbonylase that converts fatty acid metabolites into alkanes. Alkanes are components of waxes in the plant cuticle, a waterproof barrier serving to protect land plants from both biotic and abiotic stimuli. CER1 enzymes can be used to produce alternative and sustainable hydrocarbons in eukaryotic systems. In this report we identified 193 CER1 and 128 CER3 sequences from 56 land plants respectively. CER1 and CER3 proteins have high amino acid similarity and both are involved in alkane synthesis in Arabidopsis. The common homologues of CER1 and CER3 genes were identified in three species of chlorophytes, which may be one of the earliest plant taxa that possess CER1 and CER3 genes. To facilitate potential applications, the 3-dimensional structure and conserved motifs of CER1 proteins were also characterized. CER1 and CER3 proteins are structurally similar, but CER1 proteins have more conserved histidine-containing motifs common to fatty acid hydroxylases and stearoyl-CoA desaturases. There was no significant loss or gain of protein motifs after ancient and recent duplications, suggesting that varied properties of CER1 proteins may be associated with less-conserved regions. Among 56 land plants, the codon-based assessments of selection modes revealed that neither entire proteins nor individual amino acids of CER1 proteins were significantly subjected to positive selection, indicating that CER1 proteins are highly conserved throughout evolution.",

     "publication date": "06-2019",
     "abstract": "Sequence comparison is an important topic in bioinformatics. With the exponential increase of biological sequences, the traditional protein sequence comparison methods — the alignment methods become limited, so the alignment-free methods are widely proposed in the past two decades. In this paper, we considered not only the six typical physicochemical properties of amino acids, but also their frequency and positional distribution. A 51-dimensional vector was obtained to describe the protein sequence. We got a pairwise distance matrix by computing the standardized Euclidean distance, and discriminant analysis and phylogenetic analysis can be made. The results on the Influenza A virus and ND5 datasets indicate that our method is accurate and efficient for classifying proteins and inferring the phylogeny of species.",

     "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequent type of cancer in men. Hypericum perforatum (H. Perforatum) extract (HPE) administration provides remarkable decrease of PCa development. H. perforatum contains 7 conserved miRNAs (Hyp-miR-156a, Hyp-miR-156b, Hyp-miR-166, Hyp-miR-390, Hyp-miR-394, Hyp-miR-396 and Hyp-miR-414) with different targets. In this study, we aimed to investigate cross-kingdom gene regulation via miRNAs of H. perforatum flower dietetically absorbed in manner of an in silico approach to define potential biomarkers for PCa. psRNATarget database was used to find human genes targeted by 7 pre-defined H. perforatum miRNAs. We defined the mostly affected gene families from these miRNAs as ZNF, TMEM, SLC and FAM gene families. GeneMANIA database was used to define the most affected genes (TMEM41B and SLC4A7) from these 7 miRNAs. cBioPortal database was used to define alteration frequencies of TMEM41B and SLC4A7 on different types of PCa and to measure the mutual interaction potency and significance of co-occurence in PCa. This analysis showed that neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) had the highest total mutation frequency (22%) of TMEM41B and SLC4A7 genes. Also, TMEM41B and SLC4A7 genes had an average 2.1% pathway change potential among all different types of PCa. Moreover, TMEM41B and SLC4A7 gene pair was found significantly co-occurrent in PCa (p < 0.001). Finally, via GEPIA database, we used Spearman correlation analysis to measure the correlation degree of TMEM41B and SLC4A7 genes in PCa and found their significant correlation with PCa (p = 1.2 × 10−12, R = 0.28). All in all, it was proved in silico and supported with previously known clinical data that SLC4A7 and TMEM41B potentially have a significant and critical tumor suppressive role for PCa, and show this effect combinatorily working together. This is the first study correlating SLC4A7 and TMEM41B with PCa significantly.",

Various linear and non-linear chemometric regression techniques were used to build QSRR models for chromatographic lipophilicity prediction of a series of triazole, tetrazole, toluenesulfonylhydrazide, nitrile, dinitrile and dione steroid derivatives. Linear regression (LR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) were used as linear techniques, while artificial neural networks (ANNs) were applied as non-linear modeling techniques. Generated models were statistically evaluated applying different approaches for model comparison and ranking. Two non-parametric methods (generalized pair correlation method – GPCM and sum of ranking differences – SRD) were used for model ranking and assessment of the best model for chromatographic lipophilicity prediction using experimentally obtained logk values and row average as a reference ranking. Both, GPCM and SRD, provided highly similar model choice regardless on a different background. These results are in agreement with the classical approach.",

     "abstract": "BMPR1A (BMP type 1 receptor) is a transmembrane cell-surface receptor also known as ALK3 (activin-like kinases-3) encodes for a type I serine/threonine kinase receptor and a member of the transforming growth-factor β–receptor (TGF-β) super family. The BMPR1A has a significant interaction with BMP-2 for protein activity and also has a low affinity with growth and differentiation factor 5 (GDF5); positively regulates chondrocyte differentiation. The genetic variations can alter the structure and function of the BMPR1A gene that causes several diseases such as juvenile polyposis syndrome or hereditary cancer-predisposing syndrome. The current study was carried out to identify potential deleterious non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in BMPR1A by implementing different computational algorithms such as SIFT, PolyPhen2, SNAP2, PROVEAN, PhD-SNP, SNPs&GO, nsSNPAnalyzer, and P-Mut. From 205 nsSNPs in BMPR1A, 7 nsSNPs (C76Y, C124R, C124Y, C376Y, R443C, R480W, and W487R) were predicted as deleterious in 8 prediction algorithms. The Consurf analysis showed that selected 7 nsSNPs were present in the highly conserved regions. Molecular dynamics simulation analysis also performed to explore conformational changes in the variant structure with respect to its native structure. According to the MDS result, all variants flexibility and rigidity were unbalanced, which may alter the structural and functional behavior of the native protein. Although, three nsSNPs i.e., C124R, C376Y, and R443C have already been reported in patients associated with JPS, but their structural and functional molecular studies remain uncharacterized. Therefore, the findings of this study can provide a better understanding of uncharacterized nsSNPS and to find their association with disease susceptibility and also facilitate to the researchers for designing or developing the target dependent drugs.",

     "abstract": "In this study, the structural and antioxidant behavior of the three lichen-derived natural compounds such as atranorin (AT), evernic acid (EV) and diffractaic acid (DF) has been investigated in the gas and water phase using both B3LYP and M06-2X functional level of density functional theory (DFT) with two different basis sets 6-31+G (d, p) and 6-311++G (d, p). The intramolecular H–bonds (IHB) strength, aromaticity and noncovalent interactions (NCI) have been computed with the help of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM). This calculation gives major structural characteristics that indirectly influence the antioxidant behavior of the investigated compounds. The spin density (SD) delocalization of the unpaired electron is found to be the main stabilizing factor of neutral and cationic radical species. The main mechanisms, recommended in the literature, for the antioxidant action of polyphenols as radical scavengers such as hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), single electron transfer followed by proton transfer (SET-PT), and sequential proton loss electron transfer (SPLET), were examined. The result shows that the HAT and SPLET mechanism are the most conceivable one for the antioxidant action of this class of compounds in gas and water phase respectively. Preference of SPLET over HAT in water phase is due to the significantly lower value of proton affinity (PA) compared to the bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) value. This study reveals that O2-H3, O9-H26 and O4-H45 respectively are the most favored site of AT, EV and DF for homolytic as well as heterolytic OH bond breaking.",

A comparative model of pfPI4KB was first constructed and validated using molecular docking techniques. Performance of Autodock4.2 and Vina4 software in predicting the inhibitor-PI4KB binding mode and energy was assessed based on two Test Sets: Test Set I contained five ligands with resolved crystal structures with PI4KB, while Test Set II considered eleven compounds with known IC50 value towards PI4KB. The outperformance of Autodock as compared to Vina was reported, giving a correlation coefficient (R2) value of 0.87 and 0.90 for Test Set I and Test Set II, respectively. Pharmacophore-based screening was then conducted to identify drug-like molecules from ZINC database with physicochemical similarity to two potent pfPI4KB inhibitors –namely cpa and cpb. For each query inhibitor, the best 1000 hits in terms of TanimotoCombo scores were selected and subjected to molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. Binding energy was then estimated using molecular mechanics–generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) approach over 50 ns MD simulations of the inhibitor-pfPI4KB complexes. According to the calculated MM-GBSA binding energies, ZINC78988474 and ZINC20564116 were identified as potent pfPI4KB inhibitors with binding energies better than those of cpa and cpb, with ΔGbinding ≥ −34.56 kcal/mol.

     "abstract": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (most commonly known as NMR Spectroscopy) is used to generate approximate and partial distances between pairs of atoms of the native structure of a protein. To predict protein structure from these partial distances by solving the Euclidean distance geometry problem from the partial distances obtained from NMR Spectroscopy, we can predict three-dimensional (3D) structure of a protein. In this paper, a new genetic algorithm is proposed to efficiently address the Euclidean distance geometry problem towards building 3D structure of a given protein applying NMR's sparse data. Our genetic algorithm uses (i) a greedy mutation and crossover operator to intensify the search; (ii) a twin removal technique for diversification in the population; (iii) a random restart method to recover from stagnation; and (iv) a compaction factor to reduce the search space. Reducing the search space drastically, our approach improves the quality of the search. We tested our algorithms on a set of standard benchmarks. Experimentally, we show that our enhanced genetic algorithms significantly outperforms the traditional genetic algorithms and a previously proposed state-of-the-art method. Our method is capable of producing structures that are very close to the native structures and hence, the experimental biologists could adopt it to determine more accurate protein structures from NMR data.",

One aspect of glycoengineering is to introduce new N-glycosylation site (Asn-X-Thr/Ser, where X ≠ Pro) into desirable positions in the peptide backbone, resulting in the generation of hyper-glycosylated protein. In this study, human luteinizing hormone (LH) was considered for identification of the suitable positions for the addition of new N-linked glycosylation sites. A rational in silico approach was applied for prediction of structural and functional alterations caused by changes in amino acid sequence. As the first step, we explored the amino acid sequence of LH to find out desirable positions for introducing Asn or/and Thr to create new N-glycosylation sites. This exploration led to the identification of 38 potential N-glycan sites, and then the four acceptable ones were selected for further analysis. Three-dimensional (3D) structures of the selected analogs were generated and examined by the model evaluation methods. Finally, two analogs with one additional glycosylation site were suggested as the qualified analogs for hyper-glycosylation of the LH, which can be considered for further experimental investigations. Our computational strategy can reduce laborious and time-consuming experimental analyses of the analogs.",

T2D related microarray data downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and re-analysis performed with in house R packages scripts for background correction, normalization and identification of DEGs in T2D. Also retrieved T2D related DEGs information from GWAS catalog. Both DEGs lists were grouped after removal of overlapping genes. These screened DEGs were utilized further for identification and characterization of key hub genes in T2D and its associated diseases using STRING, WebGestalt and Panther databases. Computational analysis reveal that out of 99 identified key hub gene candidates from 348 DEGs, only four genes (CCL2, ELMO1, VEGFA and TCF7L2) along with FOS playing key role in causing T2D and its associated disorders, like nephropathy, neuropathy, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer via p53 or Wnt signaling pathways.

     "abstract": "A method aiming at investigating possible bioactive conformations of acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing (QS) modulators is established. The method relies on the exhaustive conformational analysis of AHLs by varying torsion angles around the amide group then on the selection of the closest conformation to those known from co-crystallized XRD data of AHL-receptor complexes. These latter are then docked as rigid ligand within the receptor binding site, leading to interactions with binding site residues which are highly consistent as compared with the data arising from XRD studies. The method is first validated using AHLs for which XRD data of their complexes with their cognate receptor are available, then extended to examples for which the binding mode is still unknown.Three compounds were used to validate the method: hexanoyl homoserine lactone (HHL) as an example of autoinducer, 3-oxo-butanoyl homoserine lactone (OBHL), as a representative model of 3-oxo-AHLs, and 4-(4-chlorophenoxy)butanoyl homoserine lactone (CPOBHL) as an example of a QS inhibitor. The conformational analysis of these three compounds to their cognate protein (TraR, SdiA, LasR and CviR) provides the data which enable the next rigid docking step. Further rigid docking of the closest conformations compared to the known bioactive ones within the binding sites allows to recover the expected binding mode with high precision (atomic RMSD < 2 Å). This “conformational analysis/torsion angle filter/rigid ligand docking” method was then used for investigating three non-natural AHL-type QS inhibitors without known co-crystallized XRD structures, namely was 2-hexenoyl homoserine lactone (HenHL), 3-oxo-4-phenylbutanoyl homoserine lactone (OPBHL) and 3-(4-bromophenyl)propanoyl homoserine lactone (BPPHL). Results provide insights into their possible binding mode by identifying specific interactions with some key residues within the receptor binding site, allowing discussion of their biological activity.",

A series of phenylisoxazole carbohydrazides was designed, synthesized and screened for both MAO-A and MAO-B inhibition using Amplex Red assays. None of the compounds inhibited the MAO-A activity while most of them significantly inhibited MAO-B in the micromolar to nanomolar range. Among them, the compound N'-(4-methylbenzylidene)-5-phenylisoxazole-3-carbohydrazide (6c) exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity towards MAO-B. Enzyme kinetic studies revealed the reversible and competitive nature of compound 6c towards MAO-B inhibition. The results of the enzyme inhibition assay were in agreement with molecular docking study, in which compound 6c displayed a strong binding affinity for MAO-B with a docking score of -10.98 Kcal/mol. In order to explore the neuroprotective effect of compound 6c, MPTP-induced mouse model for Parkinson’s disease was used, and motor behavioural assessment of experimental animals was carried out. The compound 6c was able to significantly prevent the MPTP-induced neurotoxicity as revealed by improvement in gait behaviour in footprint test and increase in grip strength score in horizontal wire test. Thus, phenylisoxazole carbohydrazides can be promising leads in the development of potent, selective and reversible MAO-B inhibitors for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.",

     "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health challenge. It has been afflicting human for thousands of years and is still severely affecting a huge population. The etiological agent of the disease is Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) that survives in the human host in latent, dormant, and non-replicative state by evading the immune system. It is one of the leading causes of infection related death worldwide. The situation is exacerbated by the massive increase in the resistant strains such as multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensive drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). The resistance is as severe that it resulted in failure of the current chemotherapy regimens (i.e. anti-tubercular drugs). It is therefore imperative to discover the new anti-tuberculosis drug targets and their potential inhibitors. Current study has made the use of in silico approaches to perform the comparative metabolic pathway analysis of the MTBXDR1219 with the host i.e. H. sapiens. We identified several metabolic pathways which are unique to pathogen only. By performing subtractive genomic analysis 05 proteins as potential drug target are retrieved. This study suggested that the identified proteins are essential for the bacterial survival and non-homolog to the host proteins. Furthermore, we selected glucosyl-3-phosoglycerate phosphatase (GpgP, EC 5.4.2.1) out of the 05 proteins for molecular docking analysis and virtual screening. The protein is involved in the biosynthesis of methylglucose lipopolysaccharides (MGLPs) which regulate the biosynthesis of mycolic acid. Mycolic acid is the building block of the unique cell wall of the MTB which is responsible for the resistance and pathogenicity. A relatively larger library consisting of 10,431 compounds was screened using AutoDock Vina to predict the binding modes and to rank the potential inhibitors. No potent inhibitor against MTB GpgP has been reported yet, therefore ranking of compounds is performed by making a comparison with the substrate i.e. glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate. The obtained results provide the understanding of underlying mechanism of interactions of ligands with protein. Follow up study will include the study of the Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs), and to propose the potential inhibitors against them.",

     "abstract": "Cystic echinococcosis (CE) as a zoonotic parasitic disease, remains a health challenge in many parts of the world. There are different species of Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato with different pathogenicity and host preferences.Different procedures have been applied for characterization of Echinococcus taxa in which two mitochondrial genes, cox1 and nad1 have been used more common. They have been able to differentiate E. granulosus sensu stricto and E. canadensis species in different hosts. The affinity of E. granulosus sensu stricto and E. canadensis species for localizing different organs seems to be different. To what such affinity and related pathogenicity could be related, is not known, so far. Bioinformatics analysis may be helpful to interpret such difference by investigating the genes and their related protein models between different species infecting human and animals. The current work was designed to study the differences between E. granulosus s.s. and E. canadensis species mitochondrial genes (cox1 and nad1) and related protein models of CE cysts by experimental and bioinformatics analysis.Different human and animal CE cysts were collected and their DNA was extracted and sequenced based on their cox1 and nad1 genes. In order to determine the E. granulosus s.s. and E. canadensis species of the samples, BLAST analysis was performed on sequenced genes. Three sequences were selected for analysis and were deposited in GenBank. Moreover, the sequence number of KT988116.1 which belonged to E. canadensis from our already deposited in GenBank was also selected. Alignment and phylogenetic analysis were performed on the sequences using BioEdit and MEGA7 software. The raw sequences of translated proteins belonged to the mentioned genes were obtained from Protein database in NCBI. The secondary structure was determined by PSIPRED Protein Sequence Analysis Workbench. The tertiary models of COX1 and NAD1 proteins in both genotypes were constructed using Modeler 9.12 software and their physicochemical features were computed using ProtParam tool in ExPASY server.BLAST analysis on sequenced genes showed that the samples belonged to E. granulosus s.s. and E. canadensis species. These sequences were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers: JN579173.1, KF437811.1, and KY924632.1.The results showed that proteins of COX1 of E. granulosus s.s., COX1of E. canadensis, NAD1of E. granulosus s.s. and NAD1of E. canadensis species, consisted of 135, 122, 120 and 124 amino acids, respectively. The aligned sequences of translated proteins belonged to COX1 and NAD1 enzymes in E. granulosus s.s. and E. canadensis species were different; such that alignment COX1 sequence between E. granulosus s.s. and E. canadensis species showed that amino acids were different in 6 positions. This difference for NAD1 sequences were different in 19 positions. The secondary structure determined by PSIPRED showed differences in coil, strand and helix chains in COX1 and NAD1 proteins in E. granulosus s.s. and E. canadensis species. Comparison between three-dimensional structures (3D) of COX1 protein model in E. granulosus s.s. and E. canadensis species demonstrated an additional helix with two conserved iron binding sites in the COX1 protein of E. granulosus s.s. species.E. granulosus s.s. and E. canadensis species differences are reflected in two important proteins: COX1 and NAD1. These differences are demonstrable in the 3D structure of proteins of both strains. So, the present study is adding to our understanding of the difference in molecular sequences between the E. granulosus s.s. (G1) and E. canadensis (G6) which may be used for interpreting the difference between the pathogenicity and localization affinity in these two important helminthic zoonosis.",

Despite of having significant evidence for the role of SKP2 on tumorgenesis, there is a lack of available data regarding the effect of non-synonymous polymorphisms. In this communication, the structural and functional consequences of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) of SKP2 have been reported by employing various computational approaches and molecular dynamics simulation. Initially, several computational tools like SIFT, PolyPhen-2, PredictSNP, I-Mutant 2.0 and ConSurf have been implicated in this study to explore the damaging SNPs. In total of 172 nsSNPs, 5 nsSNPs were identified as deleterious and 3 of them were predicted to be decreased the stability of protein. Guided from ConSurf analysis, P101L (rs761253702) and Y346C (rs755010517) were categorized as the highly conserved and functional disrupting mutations. Therefore, these mutations were subjected to three dimensional model building and molecular dynamics simulation study for the detailed structural consequences upon the mutations. The study revealed that P101L and Y346C mutations increased the flexibility and changed the structural dynamics. As both these mutations are located in the most functional regions of SKP2 protein, these computational insights might be helpful to consider these nsSNPs for wet-lab confirmatory analysis as well as in rationalizing future population based studies and structure based drug design against SKP2.",

The compounds have been tested in vitro for their anticancer activity against wild type human ovarian cancer cell line A2780, prostate cancer cell line PC3 and normal human fibroblast cells 3T3. To completely characterize optimal anticancer activity, a comprehensive model using piecewise recursive Hill model is used to quantitatively assess the in vitro anticancer effect of the tested compounds as a function of concentration and exposure time for periods ranging from 24 to 72 h. A robust artificial intelligence approach i.e. the “Support Vector Machine (SVM) Learning Algorithm” is adopted to utilize the data obtained at different temporal values, to identify compounds that trail forecasting algorithm.All the synthesized analogues were found biocompatible. Significantly low EC50 values indicated that tested compounds have potent anticancer activity against A2780 cell line in comparison to PC3 cells where only few compounds generated same impact at almost 200 times high dose. On the basis of EC50 values, compounds 7 h, 7 m, 9c, 9b, 7c, 7b and 7 g were identified as the most active anticancer agent against A2780. Three major patterns of drug response heterogeneity were observed for different compounds in the form of multiple Hill graphs and shallow slopes. The anticancer efficiency of the compounds was verified using Machine learning SVM regression learner algorithm. For compounds 7a, 7b, 7e, 7 g, 7o, 7 r, 9b, 9e-9 g higher accuracy was found in predicted and experimentally obtained end point potency in terms of % viability.Pharmacodynamics modeling of anticancer potential of the synthesized compounds revealed that drug efficacy and response heterogeneity could be modulated by changing the exposure time to optimize therapeutic impact. Combining experimental results with AI based drug action forecasting, compounds 7b, 7 g, and 9b may be tested further as potent anticancer agent for in vivo studies. This approach may serve a useful tool for extrapolation of in vitro results for generating lead compounds in in vivo and preclinical studies.",

To this end, high-throughput biological data have been generated through advancements in a variety of technologies. These rely on computational approaches to discover underlying structures in such data. Among these computational approaches, Bayesian networks (BNs) stand out because their probabilistic nature enables them to manage randomness in the dynamics of gene regulation and experimental data. Feedback loops inherent in networks of regulatory relationships are more tractable when enhancements to BNs are applied to them. Here, we propose Restricted-Derestricted dynamic BNs with a novel search technique, Restricted-Derestricted Greedy Method, for such tasks. This approach relies on the Restricted-Derestricted Greedy search technique to infer transcriptional regulatory networks in two phases: restricted inference and derestricted inference. An application of this approach to real data sets reveals it performs favourably well compared to other existing well performing dynamic BN approaches in terms of recovering true relationships among genes. In addition, it provides a balance between searching for optimal networks and keeping biologically relevant regulatory interactions among variables.",

Contributions due to di-nucleotides play a major role in studying the DNA conformation profile. The physicochemical parameters used are hydrogen bonding energy, stacking energy and solvation energy per base pair. Our computational study shows that all sequence elements in this study have distinctive physicochemical signatures and the same can be exploited for prediction experiments. The order that we see in a DNA sequence is dictated by biological regions and hence, there exists role of dependency in the sequence makeup, keeping this in mind we are proposing two computational schemes (a) using a windowing block size procedure and (b) using di-nucleotide transitions. We obtained better discriminating profile when we analyzed the sequence data in windowing manner. In the second novel approach, we introduced the di-nucleotide transition probability matrix (DTPM) to study the hidden layer of information embedded in the sequences. DTPM has been used as weights for scanning and predictions. This proposed computational scheme incorporates the memory property which is more realistic to study the physicochemical properties embedded in DNA sequences.

In this study, we firstly constructed an integrated background regulatory network. Then, based on mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA differential expression, we identified 147, 140, 284, 1031 dysregulated FFLs for luminal A, luminal B, HER2+ and basal-like subtype of breast cancer, respectively. Importantly, the known breast cancer-associated lncRNAs and miRNAs were enriched in the identified dysregulated FFLs. Through merging the dysregulated FFLs, we constructed the regulatory sub-network for each subtype. We found that all sub-networks were enriched in the well-known cancer-related pathways, such as cell cycle, pathways in cancer.

This study presents a model for the three-dimensional structure of Sm32 determined by means of homology modeling and a molecular dynamics simulation with explicit solvent refinement. The structure proved to be consistent with other AEs of known crystal structures described in their proenzyme form, revealing a catalytic domain that has a caspase-like overall structure and a C-terminal prodomain that adopts a death-domain-like architecture. We identified amino acid mutations in the βIV strand, differences in the active site and in the surface electrostatic potentials between Sm32 and its homologous proteins of mouse and human. Additionally, amino acid changes in the activation peptide (AP) of the S. mansoni protein were determined. Our results strongly suggest that Sm32 can be exploited as a potential target for drug design and for the development of biomarkers used in diagnosis and in novel vaccines for the control of parasitic infection, opening the perspective of medicinal chemistry developments.",

However, no systematical study of TCP family genes in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) has been undertaken. In this study, a total of 31 non-redundant TCP transcription factors of potato were identified and divided into two subfamilies including three distinct subclades. The various orthologous TCP genes in Arabidopsis, rice, potato and tomato were identified using synteny and phylogenetic analysis. Protein motif analysis demonstrated that StTCPs in the same subclade shared similar conserved motif structures. Gene structure analysis showed that almost all StTCPs displayed highly conserved exon-intron organization. The analysis of StTCP gene promoter regions revealed that multiple cis-acting elements were involved in plant growth, development, hormone responses as well as stress responses. The result of StTCP gene expression profiles showed they had tissue-specific expression patterns which implied their differentiated functions. According to the results of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), 7 StTCP genes were dramatically up-regulated during the release of tuber dormancy and some specific StTCP genes were strongly responding to different abiotic stresses and multiple hormones, which suggested they had important roles in potato growth and development processes.

This investigation assessed, for the first time, the enzyme inhibitory properties, antioxidant activity, phytochemical profile, antimutagenic, and antimicrobial potential of the ethyl acetate, methanol, and water extracts of H. sphondylium. We also established the possible interactions of identified phenolic compounds with cholinesterases, amylase, glucosidase, and tyrosinase using in silico docking studies. Chlorogenic acid was found in high amounts in the methanol extract of H. sphondylium. The methanol extract was an effective inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (1.70 mg galantamine equivalent (GALAE)/g extract) while the ethyl acetate extract showed pronounced inhibitory action against butyrylcholinesterase (1.77 mg GALAE/g extract). The extracts exhibited low inhibition against amylase (0.12-0.84 mmol acarbose equivalent (ACAE)/g extract) and a more pronounced inhibition against glucosidase (2.29–3.65 mmol ACAE/g extract). In silico results showed that rutin and quercetin (-70.4 and -72.2 Kcal/mol, for rutin and quercetin respectively) docked to the enzymatic cavity of acetylcholinesterase but these phenolic compounds showed less affinity with butyrylcholinesterase (-15.0 and -5.2 Kcal/mol, for rutin and quercetin respectively). The extracts did not induce any mutations on the bacterial strains, while they have excellent antimutagenic capacity against well-known mutagens (inhibition values 98%, 97% and 96%). The methanol extract (0.78 mg/ml) showed moderate antifungal activity while the ethyl acetate extract (0.78–3.12 mg/ml) showed weak to moderate antimicrobial activity.

Computer aided drug designing (CADD) is one of the several approaches that can assist in identifying the potent actives against Mycobacterium. In this work, a series of 109 known Mycobacterial membrane proteins large 3 (MmpL3) inhibitors were pooled and atom based 3D QSAR analysis was performed to understand the structural features essential for inhibitory activity against the MmpL3, known to be a key player in transporting substances critical for cell wall integrity of Mycobacterium. The data set employed was randomly split into training set and test set molecules. The training set of 74 molecules was used to derive CoMFA and CoMSIA models that were statistically reliable (CoMFA: q2loo = 0.53; r2ncv = 0.93 and CoMSIA: q2loo = 0.60; r2ncv = 0.93). The derived models also exhibited good external predictive ability (CoMFA: r2pred = 0.78 and CoMSIA: r2pred = 0.79). The results are quite encouraging and information derived from these analyses was applied to design new molecules. The designed molecule showed appreciable predicted activity values and reasonably good ADMET profile. The strategy used in designing new molecules can be pursued in the hunt for new chemical entities targeting MmpL3, expanding the existing arsenal against TB.",

CB2 plays an essential role in the immune system. It also associates in the pathology of different ailment conditions. In this scenario, the synthetic drugs are inducing side effects to the human beings after the drug use. Therefore, this study is seeking novel alternate drug molecules with least side effects than conventional drugs. The alternative drug molecules were chosen from the natural sources. These molecules were selected from cyanobacteria with the help of earlier research findings. The target and ligand molecules were obtained from recognized databases. The bioactive molecules are selected from various cyanobacterial species, which are selected by their biological and pharmacological properties, after, which we incorporated to the crucial findings such as homology modelling, molecular docking, MD simulations along with absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) analysis. Initially, the homology modelling was performed to frame the target from unknown sequences of CB2, which revealed 44% of similarities and 66% of identities with the A2A receptor. Subsequently, the CB2 protein molecule has docked with already known and prepared bioactive molecules, agonists and antagonist complex. In the present study, the agonists (5) and antagonist (1) were also taken for comparing the results with natural molecules. At the end of the docking analysis, the cyanobacterial molecules and an antagonist TNC-201 are revealed better docking scores with well binding contacts than the agonists. Especially, the usneoidone shows better results than other cyanobacterial molecules, and it is very close docking scores with that of TCN-201. Therefore, the usneoidone has incorporated to MD simulation with Cannabinoid receptors 2 (CB2). In MD simulations, the complex (CB2 and usneoidone) reveals better stability in 30 ns. Based on the computational outcome, we concluded that usneoidone is an effectual and appropriate drug candidate for activating CB2 receptors and it will be serving as a better component for the complications of CB2. Moreover, these computational approaches can be motivated to discover novel drug candidates in the pharmacological and healthcare sectors.",

Approximately 35% of patients with JMML occur D61Y mutation in PTPN11, and it increases the activity of the protein. However, the effect of the D61Y mutation on SHP2 conformations in molecular basis is poorly understood. Therefore, the molecular dynamics simulations on SHP2-D61Y and SHP2-WT were performed to explore the effect of D61Y mutation on SHP2 and explain the reason for high activity of SHP2-D61Y mutant. The study on the RMSF, per-residue RMSD, PCA, DCCM and secondary structure found that the flexibilities of regions (residues His458-Ser460 and Gln506-Ala509) in SHP2-D61Y were higher than the corresponding regions in SHP2-WT, and the conformations of these regions almost transformed from α-helix and β-strand to Turn, respectively.

The compound was characterized by elemental analysis, IR, UV–vis, NMR and mass spectral studies. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies revealed that the compound crystallized in monoclinic space group P21/c. Density functional calculations of DPDHN was performed using DFT (B3LYP) method with 6-311G (5D, 7F) basis set, geometrical optimization best fit to single crystal XRD values. The charge delocalization has been analyzed using natural orbital (NBO) analysis. Effects of halogenations at ortho, meta and para positions in the title compound is discussed for frontier molecular orbital analysis, molecular electrostatic potential plots and nonlinear optical properties. It exhibited significant antioxidant property. To predict the anticancer activity of the compound, molecular docking studies were done using Schrödinger software. Molecular docking studies for DPDHN was performed on the active site of protein kinase CK2 (PDB ID: 2OXX, 1M2R and 1M2P) and to explore the estrogen receptor binding ability, the target protein with PDB ID: 3ERT and 2YLY were selected. Docking scores of the designed compound was compared with FDA approved drugs, Tamoxifen, Daunorubicin and Doxorubicin. The compound DPDHN exhibited good Glide scores for all the proteins. Glide score of DPDHN (PDB ID: 2YLY) was -9.67 kcal/mol which was as good as the currently used breast cancer drug, Tamoxifen (-10.37 kcal/mol) and found better than the drug Doxorubicin (-7.3 kcal/mol). Lead compound that satisfies predefined minimum criteria further structure and activity optimization. In the present work, hence it was further subjected to in vitro studies towards human breast cancer (MCF-7) and colon cancer (HCT-15) cell lines. The IC50 value of compound DPDHN in MCF-7 cells was 15.21 μM and that of HCT-15 was 39.21 μM which was a lower value and better than that of lawsone. Therefore DPDHN exhibited much higher toxicity towards MCF-7 cell lines. Thus, the results indicate that DPDHN is a potential anti cancer lead molecule especially for breast cancer studies.",

     "abstract": "Secondary metabolites are a range of bioactive compounds yielded by bacteria, fungi and plants, etc. The published archaea genomic data provide the opportunity for efficient identification of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) by genome mining. However, the study of secondary metabolites in archaea is still rare. By using the antiSMASH, we found two main putative secondary metabolite BGCs, bacteriocin and terpene in 203 Archaea genomes. Compared with the genomes of Euryarchaeota that usually lives in less complexity of environment, the genomes of Crenarchaeota usually contained more abundant bacteriocin. In these archaea genomes, we also found the positive correlation between the abundance of bacteriocin and the abundance of CRISPR spacer, suggesting the bacteriocin might be a crucial component of the innate immune system that defense the microbe living in the common environment. The structure analysis of the bacteriocin gene clusters gave a clue that the assisted genes located at the edge of clusters evolved faster than the core biosynthetic genes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to systematically explore the distribution of secondary metabolites in archaea, and the investigation of the relationship between BGC and CRISPR spacer expands our understanding of the evolutionary dynamic of these functional molecules.",

     "abstract": "Pathogen–host interactions are very important to figure out the infection process at the molecular level, where pathogen proteins physically bind to human proteins to manipulate critical biological processes in the host cell. Data scarcity and data unavailability are two major problems for computational approaches in the prediction of pathogen–host interactions. Developing a computational method to predict pathogen–host interactions with high accuracy, based on protein sequences alone, is of great importance because it can eliminate these problems. In this study, we propose a novel and robust sequence based feature extraction method, named Location Based Encoding, to predict pathogen–host interactions with machine learning based algorithms. In this context, we use Bacillus Anthracis and Yersinia Pestis data sets as the pathogen organisms and human proteins as the host model to compare our method with sequence based protein encoding methods, which are widely used in the literature, namely amino acid composition, amino acid pair, and conjoint triad. We use these encoding methods with decision trees (Random Forest, j48), statistical (Bayesian Networks, Naive Bayes), and instance based (kNN) classifiers to predict pathogen–host interactions. We conduct different experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. We obtain the best results among all the experiments with RF classifier in terms of F1, accuracy, MCC, and AUC.",

Virtual screening based molecular docking was performed to find novel and potential lead compound targeting PI3Kδ, at first. Subsequently, drug likeness studies were carried out on the retrieved hits to evaluate and analyze their drug like properties such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) for toxicity prediction. Three least toxic compounds were selected for the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for 30 ns in order to validate its stability inside the active site of PI3Kδ receptor.Based on the present in silico analysis, two molecules have been identified which occupied the same binding pocket confirming the selection of active site.

These two ligand’s behaviors also showed consistency during the simulation of protein-ligand complexes for 30000 ps respectively, which is indicative of its stability in the receptor pocket.Compound ASN 16296138 and BAS 00227397 are potential candidates for experimental validation of biological activity against PI3Kδ in future drug discovery studies.

Today, few studies have been conducted on the identification of miRNAs and components of miRNA biogenesis on embryonic development in crustaceans, especially in prawns. In this context, the aim of this study was to identify in silico components of miRNA biogenesis, and miRNAs and potential target genes during embryonic development in the prawn Macrobrachium olfersii through small RNAs and transcriptome analyses. Using the miRDeep2 program, we identified 17 miRNA precursors in M. olfersii, which seven (miR-9, miR-10, miR-92, miR-125, miR-305, miR-1175, and miR-2788) were reported in the miRBase database, indicating high evolutionary conservation of these sequences among animals. The other 10 miRNAs of M. olfersii were novel miRNAs and only similar to Macrobrachium niponnense miRNAs, indicating genus-specific miRNAs. In addition, eight key components of miRNA biogenesis (DROSHA, PASHA/DGCR8, XPO5, RAN, DICER, TRBP2, AGO, and PIWI) were identified in M. olfersii embryos unigenes. In the annotation of miRNA targets, 516 genes were similar to known sequences in the GenBank database. Regarding the conserved miRNAs, we verified that they were differentially expressed during embryonic development in M. olfersii. In conclusion, this is the first study that identifies conserved and novel miRNAs in the prawn M. olfersii with some miRNA target genes involved in embryonic development.

In this study, we used in silico approach to derive FluAPep1 from highly conserved region, PAN-PB1C interface and generated 121 FluAPep1 analogues. Interestingly, we found that the FluAPep1 interaction region in the PAN domain are highly conserved in many FluA subtypes.

Two key proteins, Huntingtin associated protein-1 (HAP1) and sortilin1, regulate the intracellular trafficking and stabilization of the precursor proBDNF through interaction with its prodomain region and mark it for secretion. Evidence suggests that the most frequent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of BDNF gene (rs6265) has been associated with different psychiatric, neurodegenerative and eating disorders. In this study, structural bioinformatics and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were applied, in order to get precise insights into the impact of Val66Met polymorphism on the proBDNF structure and its interaction with HAP1 and Sortilin1. Homology modeling, structure validation, refinement and also protein-protein docking were performed using appropriate servers. The stability, the fluctuations and the compactness of protein complexes were measured by MD simulation parameters including root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) and Radius of gyration (Rg), respectively. The mutant proBDNF complexes with HAP1 and Sortilin1 revealed higher RMSD and RMSF values and also variable Rg over time compared with wild-type proBDNF. These computational results indicated that, wild-type proBDNF possessed more stable structure in binding with HAP1 and Sortilin1 compared with its mutant form. Therefore, Val66Met SNP could be deleterious due to making structural changes. It may cause a decrease in proBDNF secretion, which could possibly lead to different psychiatric, neurodegenerative and eating disorders. Further experimental lab studies are required for a more accurate conclusion.",

The kinase has been clinically observed to harbor a gatekeeper mutation T798M in its active site, which causes acquired resistance to the first-line targeted breast cancer therapy with small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Previously, several theories have been proposed to explain the molecular mechanism of gatekeeper mutation-caused drug resistance, such as blocking of inhibitor binding and increasing of ATP affinity. In the current study, the direct binding of three wild type-selective inhibitors (Lapatinib, AEE788 and TAK-285) and two wild type-sparing inhibitors (Staurosporine and Bosutinib) to the wild-type ErbB2 and its T798M mutant are investigated in detail by using rigorous computational analysis and binding affinity assay. Substitution of the polar threonine with a bulky methionine at residue 798 can impair and improve the direct binding affinity of wild type-selective and wild type-sparing inhibitors, respectively. Hindrance effect is responsible for the affinity decrease of wild type-selective inhibitors, while additional nonbonded interactions contribute to the affinity increase of wild type-sparing inhibitors, thus conferring selectivity to the inhibitors for mutant over wild type. The binding affinity of Staurosporine and Bosutinib to ErbB2 kinase domain is improved by 11.9-fold and 2.1-fold upon T798M mutation, respectively. Structural analysis reveals that a nonbonded network of S–π contact interactions (for Staurosporine) or an S-involving halogen bond (for Bosutinib) forms with the sulfide group of mutant Met798 residue.",

The Warburg effect is found in many oncogenic situations and is believed to provide energy and biomass for oncogenesis to persist. The work presented targets human PK-M2 (hPK-M2) in a virtual high-throughput screen to identify new inhibitors and leads for further study. In the initial screen, one of the 12 candidates selected for experimental validation showed biological activity (hit-rate = 8.13%). In the second screen with retrained models, six of 11 candidates selected for experimental validation showed biological activity (hit-rate: 54.5%). Additionally, four different scaffolds were identified for further analysis when examining the tested candidates and compounds in the training data. Finally, extrapolation was necessary to identify a sufficient number of candidates to test in the second screen. Examination of the results suggested stepwise extrapolation to maximize efficiency.",

     "abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the budding yeast, must remodel initial cell shape and cell wall integrity during vegetative growth and pheromone-induced morphogenesis. The cell wall remodeling is monitored and regulated by the cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling pathway. Wsc1p, together with Wsc2p and Wsc3p, belongs to a family of highly O-glycosylated cell surface proteins that function as stress sensors of the cell wall in S. cerevisiae. These cell surface proteins have the main role of activating the CWI signaling pathway by stimulating the small G-protein Rho1p, which subsequently activates protein kinase C (Pkc1p) and a mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade that activates downstream transcription factors of stress-response genes. Wsc1p, Wsc2p, and Wsc3p possess a cytoplasmic domain where two conserved regions of the sequence have been assessed to be important for Rom2p interaction. Meanwhile, other research groups have also proposed that these transmembrane proteins could support protein-protein interactions with Ras2p. Molecular structures of the cytoplasmic domain of Wsc1p, Wsc2p and Wsc3p were generated using the standard and fully-automated ORCHESTAR procedures provided by the Sybyl-X 2.1.1 program. The tridimensional structure of full length Ras2p was also generated with Phyre2. These protein models were validated with Procheck-PDBsum and ProSA-web tools and subsequently used in docking-based modeling of protein-protein and protein-compound interfaces for extensive structural and functional characterization of their interaction. The results retrieved from STRING 10.5 suggest that the Wsc-family is involved in protein-protein interactions with each other and with Ras2p. Docking-based studies also validated the existence of protein-protein interactions mainly between Motif I (Wsc3p > Wsc1p > Wsc2p) and Ras2p, in agreement with the data provided by STRING 10.5. Additionally, it has shown that Calcofluor White preferably binds to Wsc1p (-9.5 kcal/mol), meanwhile Caspofungin binds to Wsc3p (-9.1 kcal/mol), Wsc1p (-9.1 kcal/mol) and more weakly Wsc2p (-6.9 kcal/mol). Thus, these data suggests Caspofungin as a common inhibitor for the Wsc-family. MTiOpenScreen database has provided a list of new compounds with energy scores higher than those compounds used in our docking studies, thus suggesting these new compounds have a better affinity towards the cytoplasmic domains and Ras2p. Based on these data, there are new and possibly more effective compounds that should be considered as therapeutic agents against yeast infection.",

Herein, we described the identification of plant based lead compounds for treatment of AD through an integrative approach of pharmacokinetics and structure bioinformatics approach. In particular we performed screening of lead compounds from 3 traditional medicinal plants namely Withania somnifera, Bacopa monnieri and Morus alba, which are known to have potential for treatment of neurodegenerative disease. We retrieved a total of 210 plant based compounds of which 21 compounds were screened based on their pharmacokinetic properties. Further, Docking study against 7 known AD associated targets were carried out to identify the binding sites and direct interacting residues. In addition we investigate the stable and reliable binding mechanism of top such plant compounds against 3 targets through molecular docking followed by Molecular Dynamic(MD) simulation. The results obtained in the study revealed that 3 drug compounds namely Morusin (MRSN), Withanone (WTHN) and 27-Hydroxywithanolide B (HWTHN) were identified as putative lead compounds against mono amine oxidase (MAOB), Beta-secretase 1(BACE1) and phosphodiesterase 4D.",

     "abstract": "Mining patterns of co-expressed genes across the subset of conditions help to narrow down the search space for the analysis of gene expression data. Identifying conditions specific key genes from the large-scale gene expression data is a challenging task. The conditions specific key gene signifies functional behavior of a group of co-expressed genes across the subset of conditions and can be act as biomarkers of the diseases. In this paper, we have propose a novel approach for identification of conditions specific key genes from Basal-Like Breast Cancer (BLBC) disease using biclustering algorithm and Gene Co-expression Network (GCN). The proposed approach is a two-stage approach. In the first stage, significant biclusters have been extracted with the help of ‘runibic’ biclustering algorithm. The second stage identifies conditions specific key genes from the extracted significant biclusters with the help of GCN. By using difference matrix and gene correlation matrix, we have constructed biologically meaningful and statistically strong GCN. Also, presented the proposed approach with the help of a process diagram and demonstrated the procedure with an example of bicluster number 93 (Bic93). From the experimental results, we observed that 95% and 85% of the extracted biclusters are found to be biologically significant at the p-values less than 0.05 and 0.01 respectively. We have compared proposed approach with the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) based approach. From the comparison, our approach has performed effectively and extracted biologically significant biclusters. Also, identified conditions specific key genes which cannot be extracted using the WGCNA based approach. Some of the important identified known key genes are PIK3CA, SHC3, ERBB2, SHC4, PTOV1, STAG1, ZNF215 etc. These key genes can be used as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for the BLBC disease after the rigorous analysis. The identified conditions specific key genes can be helpful to reduce the analysis time and increase the accuracy of further research such as biomarker identification, drug target discovery etc.",

There are some online and offline computational tools for toxicogenomic data analysis to identify the biomarker genes and their regulatory chemical compounds/drugs. However, none of the researchers has considered yet the identification of significant interactions between genes and compounds. Therefore, in this paper, we have discussed two approaches namely moving range chart (MRC) and logistic moving range chart (LMRC) for the identification of significant up-regulatory (UpR) and down-regulatory (DnR) gene-compound interactions as well as toxicogenomic biomarkers and their regulatory chemical compounds/drugs. We have investigated the performance of both MRC and LMRC approaches using simulated datasets. Simulation results show that both approaches perform almost equally in absence of outliers. However, in presence of outliers, the LMRC shows much better performance than the MRC. In case of real life toxicogenomic data analysis, the proposed LMRC approach detected some important down-regulated biomarker genes those were not detected by other approaches. Therefore, in this paper, our proposal is to use LMRC for robust identification of significant interactions between genes and chemical compounds/drugs.",

The study presents the intra-individual characterization of 24 distinct genotypes Vigna mungo L. Hepper, using morphological as well as nrDNA ITS2 sequences and secondary structural data. The morphological characterization has been carried out using nine important agro-morphological traits. The molecular phylogeny of the sequence data, using the maximum parsimony and neighbor joining methods, shows the significant distinction based on the haplotypic variations amongst blackgram genotypes. The ITS2 secondary structures predicted using the homology modeling approach were compatible with the eukaryote-universal ITS2 secondary structure. The sequence-structure phylogeny reconstructed using the profile neighbour joining approach, also showed the presence of haplotypic variations in form of clusters on the phylogenetic tree. Further, the high GC content in the sequence data and highly negative ΔG values of the folded secondary structures ruled out the possibilities of the presence of any pseudogenes in the data set. Our analysis recommends the use of ITS2 sequence and secondary structure data at the intraspecific levels of plant taxonomical classification. Moreover, this study for the very first time reports the combined use morphological, and molecular data (using ITS2 sequence and secondary structural information) for the characterization of plants at the varietal level of taxonomical classification.",

First of all, we studied a transcriptome dataset and identified 1521 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Integration of transcriptome data with protein-protein and transcriptional regulatory interactions resulted with central (hub) proteins (UBA52, RAC1, CREBBP, AR, RPS11, SMAD3, RPS6, RPL12, RPL15, and UBC), regulatory transcription factors (FOXC1, GATA2, YY1, FOXL1, NFIC, E2F1, USF2, SRF, PPARG, and JUN) and microRNAs (mir-335-5p, mir-26b-5p, mir-93-5p, mir-124-3p, mir-17-5p, mir-16-5p, mir-20a-5p, mir-92a-3p, mir-106b-5p, and mir-192-5p) as key signaling and regulatory molecules associated with transcriptional changes for the AD.

Though much work has been done in mapping SNPs underlying diseases, most of them constrain to 2-order epistatic interactions. In this paper, a method of hypergraph construction and high-density subgraph detection, named HC-HDSD, is proposed for detecting high-order epistatic interactions. The hypergraph is constructed by low-order epistatic interactions that identified using the normalized co-information measure and the exhaustive search. The hypergraph consists of two types of vertices: real ones representing main effects of SNPs and virtual ones denoting interactive effects of epistatic interactions. Then, both maximal clique centrality algorithm and near-clique mining algorithm are employed to detect high-density subgraphs from the constructed hypergraph. These high-density subgraphs are inferred as high-order epistatic interactions in the HC-HDSD. Experiments are performed on several simulation data sets, results of which show that HC-HDSD is promising in inferring high-order epistatic interactions while substantially reducing the computation cost. In addition, the application of HC-HDSD on a real Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) data set provides several new clues for the exploration of causative factors of AMD.",

     "abstract": "Pathway analysis has become a popular technology tool for gaining insight into the underlying biology of differentially expressed genes and proteins. Although many sub-pathways analysis methods have been proposed, the function of these sub-pathways is generally implicit. In this paper, we propose a function sub-pathway analysis (FSPA) method which includes all nodes reaching a specific function node at the downstream of pathways. The perturbation degree of a sub-pathway is defined as the negative of the log p-value of the sub-pathway. The proposed FSPA allows analyzing the differentially expressed genes in a sub-pathway with diseases in explicit function level. Results from six datasets of colorectal cancer, lung cancer and pancreatic cancer show that the proposed FSPA could identify more cancer associated pathways. And more importantly, it could identify which sub-pathways lead to a specific abnormal function, and to what extent it affects the function. Furthermore, the proposed perturbation degree could also analyze the imbalance of some functions involved in some biological process. The results by FSPA are helpful for elucidating the underlying mechanisms of cancers and designing therapeutic strategies.",

     "abstract": "Accumulation of LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) within artery walls is strongly associated with the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis development. This complex trait is affected by multifactor involving polygenes, environments, and their interactions. Uncovering genetic architecture of LDL may help to increase the understanding of the genetic mechanism of cardiovascular diseases.We used a genetic model to analyze genetic effects including additive, dominance, epistasis, and ethnic interactions for data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Three lifestyle behaviors (reading, intentional exercising, smoking) were used as cofactor in conditional models.We identified 156 genetic effects of 10 quantitative trait SNPs (QTSs) in base model and three conditional models. The total estimated heritability of these genetic effects was approximately 72.88% in the base model. Five genes (CELSR2, MARK2, ADAMTS12, PFDN4, and MAGI2) have biological functions related to LDL.Compared with the based model LDL, the results in three conditional models revealed that intentional exercising and smoking could have impacts for causing and suppressing some of genetic effects and influence the levels of LDL. Furthermore, these two lifestyles could have different genetic effects for each ethnic group on a specific QTS. As most of the heritability in based model LDL and conditional model LDL|Smk was contributed from epistasis effects, our result indicated that epistasis effects played important roles in determining LDL levels. Our study provided useful insight into the biological mechanisms underlying regulation of LDL and might help in the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease.",

     "abstract": "Cancer samples clustering based on biomolecular data has been becoming an important tool for cancer classification. The recognition of cancer types is of great importance for cancer treatment. In this paper, in order to improve the accuracy of cancer recognition, we propose to use Laplacian regularized Low-Rank Representation (LLRR) to cluster the cancer samples based on genomic data. In LLRR method, the high-dimensional genomic data are approximately treated as samples extracted from a combination of several low-rank subspaces. The purpose of LLRR method is to seek the lowest-rank representation matrix based on a dictionary. Because a Laplacian regularization based on manifold is introduced into LLRR, compared to the Low-Rank Representation (LRR) method, besides capturing the global geometric structure, LLRR can capture the intrinsic local structure of high-dimensional observation data well. And what is more, in LLRR, the original data themselves are selected as a dictionary, so the lowest-rank representation is actually a similar expression between the samples. Therefore, corresponding to the low-rank representation matrix, the samples with high similarity are considered to come from the same subspace and are grouped into a class. The experiment results on real genomic data illustrate that LLRR method, compared with LRR and MLLRR, is more robust to noise and has a better ability to learn the inherent subspace structure of data, and achieves remarkable performance in the clustering of cancer samples.",

Six point pharmacophore (AAHRRR) of COX-2 selective inhibitors was generated from training set of 52 compounds. The 3D-QSAR model was selected as having favourable statistic measures (R2 = 0.93, Q2ext = 0.81) for the training set and test set respectively. This model was developed using the best pharmacophore hypothesis that helped to reveal the essential features responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity. As a result, this pharmacophore hypothesis has aided in the identification of new four natural lead compounds from UNPD database (UNPD100208, UNPD168234, UNPD91145, UNPD57376) that can be used as potential anti-inflammatory agents or as a core structure to develop other more selective molecules. This result was confirmed by molecular docking, which showed that these four natural lead-compounds adopt the same orientation as Rofecoxib in the COX-2 active site. On the other hand, a molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) was applied and repeated on the top ranking complex 5KIR-UNPD100208 and compared with the results of MDS of 5KIR-Rofecoxib. The results from MDS revealed a good stability of the compound UNPD100208 in the active site based on several parameters such as RMSD, RMSF and potential energy, which can nominate it as a natural anti-inflammatory lead-compound candidate.",

In spite of similarities in sequence and structures, the members of its pro- and anti- apoptotic subgroups form complexes with different type of partners with discriminating binding affinities. Understanding the origin of this discrimination is very important for designing ligands that can either selectively target a protein or could be made broad ranged as necessary. Using principal component analysis (PCA) of the available structures and from the analysis of the evolution of the binding pocket residues, the correlation has been investigated considering two important anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xl and Mcl-1, which serve as two ideal representatives of this family. The flexibility of the receptor enables them to discriminate between the ligands or the binding partners. It has been observed that although Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 are classified as homologous proteins, through the course of evolution the binding pocket residues are highly conserved for Bcl-xl; whereas they have been substituted frequently in Mcl-1. The investigation has revealed that the Bcl-xl can adjust the backbone conformation of the binding pocket residues to a larger extent to complement with the shape of different binding partners whereas the Mcl-1 shows more variation in the side chain conformation of binding pocket residues for the same purpose.",

Conspicuous presences of some of them as biomarkers for cancers, aging etc. are well reported. Biogenesis of circular RNA competes with Pre-mRNA splicing using the same splicing machinery and gene loci. Also, some circular RNAs are reported to have open reading frames and internal ribosome entry site for ribosome binding, which increases the chance of overlapping features among circular and mRNA transcripts. Therefore, discriminating the Exonic circular RNAs and mRNAs solely through sequence properties is challenging. However, possible discriminating factors, such as, reports on non-canonical arrangement of exons in circular RNAs were cited. This study was dedicated to classify Circular RNAs from mRNAs by recruiting features extracted from sequences as well as predicted secondary structures and ANN classifier models for all these feature types. The features were statistics of di-nucleotide index, emission probability of RNA sequences and entropy of di-nucleotides. Finally a simple decision voting was applied to combine decisions obtained from multiple classifiers. After performing 10 fold cross validation we obtained average values of efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and Mathews correlation coefficient as 0.8374, 0.8544, 0.8203 and 0.6753 respectively. In the backdrop of few reports of identification of circular RNAs from constitutive exons and other long non-coding RNAs, this is the first report of discriminating exonic circular RNAs from mRNAs using sequence and sequence-derived properties.",

In this study, SYT-SSX1 fusion protein sequence was retrieved from Uniprot and 3D structure was generated using I-TASSER modeling program. A structure based computational screening approach has been employed using Glide docking software to identify potential SYT-SSX1 small molecule inhibitors that bind to the junction region of the fusion protein. The obtained inhibitors were further filtered based on the docking score and ADME/T properties. Ten best fit compounds were chosen for in vitro studies. The anti-proliferative activities of these 10 compounds were screened in Yamato, ASKA (carries SYT-SSX1 fusion protein) and other sarcoma cell lines such as A673, 143B to understand the specificity of inhibition of the chosen compounds. The in vitro activity was compared against HEK293 cell lines. The compound 5-fluoro-3-(1-phenyl-1H-tetraazol-5-yl)-1H-indole (FPTI) was found to be selectively cytotoxic in synovial sarcoma cell lines (Yamato and ASKA) and this compound also showed insignificant anti proliferative activity on other cell lines. Further, target gene expression study confirmed that FPTI treatment down-regulated SYT-SSX1 and modulated its downstream target genes. Cell cycle analysis revealed the involvement of an apoptotic mechanism of cell death. Further experimental validations may elucidate the therapeutic potentials of FPTI against SYT-SSX1 fusion protein.",

The current antipsychotic drugs treat only the positive symptoms without alleviating the negative or cognitive symptoms of the disease. In addition, the existing therapies are known to produce extrapyramidal side effects that affect the patient adherence to the treatment. PDE10A inhibitor is the new therapeutic approach which has been proven to be effective in alleviating the negative and cognitive symptoms of the disease. A number of PDE10A inhibitors have been developed, but no inhibitor has made it beyond the clinical trials so far. Thus, the present study has been conducted to identify a PDE10A inhibitor from natural sources to be used as a lead compound for the designing of novel selective PDE10A inhibitors. Ligand and structure-based pharmacophore models for PDE10A inhibitors were generated and employed for virtual screening of universal natural products database. From the virtual screening results, 37 compounds were docked into the active site of the PDE10A. Out of 37 compounds, three inhibitors showed the highest affinity for PDE10A where UNPD216549 showed the lowest binding energy and has been chosen as starting point for designing of novel PDE10A inhibitors. The structure-activity-relationship studies assisted in designing of selective PDE10A inhibitors. The optimization of the substituents on the phenyl ring resulted in 26 derivatives with lower binding energy with PDE10A as compared to the lead compound. Among these, MA 8 and MA 98 exhibited the highest affinity for PDE10A with binding energy (−10.90 Kcal/mol).",

     "abstract": "Phthalocyanines are considered as good DNA binders, which makes them promising anti-tumor drug leads. The purpose of this study is to investigate the interactions between DNA and quaternary metallophthalocyanine derivatives (Q-MPc) possessing varying metals (M = Zn, Ni, Cu, Fe, Mg and Ca) by molecular docking since there seems to be a lack of information in the literature regarding this issue. In this direction, Autodock Vina and Molegro Virtual Docker programs were employed. Autodock Vina results reveal that each Q-MPc derivative binds to DNA strongly with similar binding energies and almost identical binding modes. They bind to the grooves of DNA by constituting favorable interactions between phosphate groups of DNA and Q-MPcs. Although changing the metal has no significant effect on binding, presence of quaternary amine substituents increases the binding constant Kb by about 2-fold comparing to the core Pc (ZnPc). Contrary to Autodock Vina, the calculated Molegro Virtual Docker binding scores have been more diverse indicating that the scoring function of Molegro is better in differentiating these metals. Despite the fact that Molegro is superior to Autodock Vina in terms of metal characterization, Autodock Vina and Molegro exhibit similar binding sites for the studied metallophthalocyanines. We propose that Q-MPc derivatives designed in this study are promising anti-tumor lead compounds since they tightly bind to DNA with considerably high Kb values. Cationic substituents and presence of metal have both positive effects on DNA binding which is critical for designing DNA-active drugs. Additional calculations employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations verified the stability of Q-MPc-DNA complexes which remained in contact after 20 ns via attractive interactions mainly between DNA backbone and the Pc metal center.",

In this study, we try to investigate GuDH inhibition using computational approaches by generating a model for buffalo GuDH. We used this model to perform blind dockings of ascorbic acid to GuDH. Some docked conformations of ascorbic acid bind near Asp39 and have steric clashes with crystal structure conformation of NADH. To assess the dynamic stability of the GuDH-ascorbic acid complex, we performed six molecular dynamics simulations for GuDH, three each in its free form and in complex with ascorbic acid for 50 ns, to obtain 300 ns of trajectories in total. During the simulations, ascorbic acid interacted with several residues nearby Asp39. As Asp39 is an important residue for NADH binding and specificity, the interaction of ascorbic acid near Asp39 hinders further NADH binding and ultimately affects the enzymatic functioning of GuDH. In this study, we analyze these interactions between ascorbic acid and GuDH. Our analysis reveals novel details on the mechanism of GuDH inhibition by ascorbic acid.",

In this study, robust QSAR classification models for predicting 5-LOX activity were developed using machine learning algorithms. The Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbour (NN) and Decision Trees were adopted to improve the prediction ability of the classification models. The most informative molecular descriptors that contribute to the prediction of 5-LOX activity are screened from e-Dragon, Ochem, PowerMV and Combined databases using Filter-based feature selection methods such as Correlation Feature Selection (CFS) and Information Gain (IG). Performances of the models were measured by 5-fold cross-validation and external test sets prediction. Evaluation of performance of feature selection revealed that the CFS method outperforms the IG method for all descriptor databases except for PowerMV database. The best ensemble classification model was obtained with the IG filtered ‘PowerMV’ descriptor database using kNN (k = 5) algorithm which displayed an overall accuracy of 76.6% for the training set and 77.9% for the test set. Finally, we employed this model as a virtual screening tool for identifying potential 5-LOX inhibitors from the e-Drug3D drug database and found 43 potential hit candidates. This top screened hits containing one known 5-LOX inhibitors zileuton as well as novel scaffolds. These compounds further screened by applying molecular docking simulation and identified four potential hits such as Belinostat, Masoprocol, Mefloquine and Sitagliptin having a comparable binding affinity to zileuton.",

Similar to other HCV nonstructural proteins, helicase is a potential target for antiviral drugs and several antiviral molecules have been used to target the RNA-binding cleft, despite the fact that none of those helicase antivirals have advanced the clinical trials. Compound 2t9 (5-bromo-1H-indol-3-yl acetic acid) has been identified through the integrated strategies and considered as a potential lead compound for the inactivation of HCV helicase. This inhibitor bind to the 3´-terminal RNA-binding cleft, and reduced the RNA binding and unwinding activity of the targeted protein. In the current study, using all-atom molecular dynamic simulation and correlations network strategy, we scrutinized the inhibitory mechanism of compound 2t9 that needs to be elucidated for the improvement of indole-based and similar HCV helicase inhibitors. Consequently, by comparing the structural dynamics of free (NS3hWT) and bound (NS3h/2t9WT) protein, we identified that the inhibitor-bound protein achieved a conformation resemblance to the open conformation, where the RNA is displaced results in destabilization of RNA-binding cleft, disruption in ATP/ADP binding site and alter the inter-domain communication.

Currently, there are 138 species of Silene in Turkey, amongst which have been several studies for possible pharmacological potential and application in food industry. However, there is currently a paucity of data on Silene salsuginea Hub.-Mor. This study endeavours to access its antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory, and anti-inflammatory properties. Besides, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (RP-HPLC-DAD) was used to detect phenolic compounds, and molecular docking was performed to provide new insights for tested enzymes and phenolics. High amounts of apigenin (534 μg/g extract), ferulic acid (452 μg/g extract), p-coumaric acid (408 μg/g extract), and quercetin (336 μg/g extract) were detected in the methanol extract while rutin (506 μg/g extract) was most abundant in the aqueous extract. As for their biological properties, the methanol extract exhibited the best antioxidant effect in the DPPH and CUPRAC assays, and also the highest inhibition against tyrosinase. The aqueous extract was the least active enzyme inhibitor but showed the highest antioxidant efficacy in the ABTS, FRAP, and metal chelating assays. At a concentration of 15.6 μg/mL, the methanol extract resulted in a moderate decrease (25.1%) of NO production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells. Among the phenolic compounds, epicatechin, (+)-catechin, and kaempferol showed the highest binding affinity towards the studied enzymes in silico. It can be concluded that extracts of S. salsuginea are a potential source of functional food ingredients but need further analytical experiments to explore its complexity of chemical compounds and pharmacological properties as well as using in vivo toxicity models to establish its maximum tolerated dose.",

This type of compendium-based cell-type identification strategy is particularly successful for human and mouse samples because a large volume of data exists for these organisms. However, such rich data repositories often do not exist for most non-model organisms. This makes transcriptome-based sample classification in these species challenging. We propose to overcome this challenge by performing a cross-species compendium comparison. The key is to utilise a recently published cross-species gene set analysis (XGSA) framework to correct for biases that may arise due to potentially complex homologous gene mapping between two species. The framework is implemented as an open source R package called C3. We have evaluated the performance of C3 using a variety of public data in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. We also compared the functionality and performance of C3 against some similar gene expression profile matching tools. Our evaluation shows that C3 is a simple and effective method for cell type identification. C3 is available at https://github.com/VCCRI/C3.",

Bioactive peptides (BP) have received much attention, particularly from the pharmaceutical industry. As they not only own potent properties but also possess less side-effects than synthetic drugs. In this work, an 8000 possible tripeptides library was constructed to predict the potential ACE inhibitory peptides by using in silico tools. GOLD molecular docking was then applied to determine the binding mode of action between ACE and each of tripeptide from this in-house library. The first 662 high-ranking tripeptides by ChemScore were chosen to create association rules of tripeptides-ACE complexes. An orientation pattern of amino acid in the binding tunnel of ACE has been examined by frequency analysis. The association rules (confident values over 90%) illustrated that hydrophobic factor has been displayed as main components in the ACE tripeptides inhibitor from four factors in equation, hydrophobic, aromatic, polar, charged. According to in silico output, five tripeptides were chosen to test in vitro study of ACE-inhibitory activity. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of these selective five peptides, WCW, IWW, WWW, WWI and WLW for inhibiting ACE were 49.50 ± 3.88 μM, 489.14 ± 8.84 μM, 536.02 ± 38.57 μM, 752.91 ± 41.89 μM and 1783 ± 0.113 μM, respectively.

The results of molecular dynamics simulation showed that the mutant AChE1 shows little structural deviation than the wild-type, indicate the structural instability.

Therefore, in this study, we aim to incorporate post translational information with radial basis function networks to improve the predictive performance of transport proteins in major classes (channels/pores, electrochemical transporters, and active transporters) and six different families (α-type channels, β-barrel porins, pore-forming toxins, porters, PP bond hydrolysis-driven transporters, and oxidoreduction-driven transporters). The experiment results by using PSSM profiles combined with PTM information could classify the transporters into three classes and six families with five-fold cross-validation accuracy of 87.6% and 92.5%, respectively. For the independent dataset of 444 proteins, the performance with post translational modification attained the accuracy of 82.13% and 89.34% for classifying three classes and six families, respectively.

In nematodes, proteases are known to play critical roles in parasitic processes like tissue penetration, digestion of host tissues for nutrition and evasion of host immune response.

Here we present our automatic multithreaded workflow for processing NGS data of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes obtained with NGS technology named BRCA-analyzer. Optimizing it on the sequencing data of 899 samples from 693 patients, we were able to find the most reliable tools and adjust their parameters in such a way that all pathogenic variants found were confirmed by Sanger’s sequencing. For 82 and 24 DNA samples from blood and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks, NGS libraries were prepared with GeneRead BRCA panel v2 (Qiagen). The reads obtained were processed with BRCA-analyzer and Qiagen GeneRead Data analysis workflow. In total 27 pathogenic variants were found and confirmed by Sanger’s sequencing, with all of them determined with BRCA-analyzer. Qiagen GeneRead Data analysis discarded 5 true pathogenic variants due to their location in homopolymeric sequence stretches. For other 793 samples, libraries were prepared by the in-house method, and NGS data were analyzed by BRCA-analyzer in comparison to another free automatic amplicon NGS workflow Canary. From total 137 pathogenic variations, BRCA-analyzer found 135 and Canary 123. Mutations were missed by BRCA-analyzer due to the trimming primer sequences from reads before mapping to be fixed in the next version. On the freely available NGS data, we showed that BRCA-analyzer could also be used for hybrid capture gene panels, although it needs more extensive testing on such library preparation methods. Thus, BRCA-analyzer is an automatic workflow for processing NGS data of BRCA1/2 genes with variant filters adapted to amplicon-based targeted NGS data.

It has been revealed that flavonoids can slow neurodegenerative processes in situations such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The β-secretase (BACE-1) is one of the most studied targets in AD therapy owing to its role in producing Aβ plaques. In fact the unique role of BACE-1 in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases has made it a druggable target to develop anti-AD agents. Taking into account the anti-amyloidogenic and anti-oxidative properties, flavonoids have received considerable attention as lead candidates for anti-AD drug discovery projects. In continuation to our interest toward rational exploration of potential anti-AD agents, it was attempted to conduct a combined structure based in silico study and explore pharmacophore of a flavanocoumarin derivative as BACE-1 Inhibitor. Ab initio studies showed that both pseudo-axial and pseudo-equatorial conformers could convert to each other freely at room temperature. Within this study it was revealed that artoflavanocoumarin possess essential pharmacophoric groups to inhibit BACE-1. Considering four different protonation states of BACE-1 as di-deprotonated, diprotonated, protonated Asp32 and protonated Asp228, it was also found that affinity of artoflavanocoumarin toward different protonation states of BACE-1could be ranked as Asp32p-Asp228i > di-deprotonated ∼ Asp32i-Asp228p >> diprotonated. PMF study on artoflavanocoumarin showed that it could pass 1.8 kcal/mol free energy barrier from water to DPPC lipid bilayer. Moreover the pros and cons of artoflavanocoumarin as a lead compound were elucidated.",

However, lack of selectivity shown by many of the current HDAC6 inhibitors in clinical use and trials prompts the continuous search for selective inhibitors. Here, 10 pharmacophore hypotheses were developed based on the 3D common features of training set of 20 HDAC inhibitors in clinical use and trials. The hypotheses were validated using a test set of another 20 HDAC inhibitors along with 400 inactive (decoys) molecules based on Güner-Henry pharmacophore scoring method. Hypothesis 1 consisting of 1 H-bond donor, 1 H-bond acceptor and 2 hydrophobic features, was used to screen “DruglikeDiverse” database using Biovia Discovery Studio 4.5. The top 10 hit compounds were selected based on the pharmacophore fit values (>3.00). Their binding affinity against HDAC6 compared to class I HDACs (1, 2, 3 & 8) and a class IIa member (HDAC7), was calculated by molecular docking using AutoDock4. The stability of binding modes of 2 potential HDAC6-selective inhibitors (ENA501965 and IBS399024) was examined by 30 ns-molecular dynamics (MD) simulation using nanoscale MD (NAMD) software. Both ligands showed potential stability in HDAC6 active site over time. Therefore, these may provide additional scaffolds for further optimization towards the design of safe, potent and selective HDAC6 inhibitors.",

Calcium plays an important role on this structures regulation. Here, using calcium as a probe, extensive atomistic Molecular Dynamics simulations were performed on the Cx26 hemichannel embedded in a lipid bilayer. Exploring different initial conditions and calcium concentration, simulation reached ∼4 μs. Several analysis were carried out in order to reveal the calcium distribution and localization, such as electron density profiles, density maps and distance time evolution, which is directly associated to the interaction energy. Specific amino acid interactions with calcium and their stability were capture within this context. Few of these sites such as, GLU42, GLU47, GLY45 and ASP50, were already suggested in the literature. Besides, we identified novel calcium biding sites: ASP2, ASP117, ASP159, GLU114, GLU119, GLU120 and VAL226. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that these sites are reported within this context. Furthermore, since various pathologies involving the Cx26 hemichannel are associated with pathogenic variants in the corresponding CJB2 gene, using ClinVar, we were able to spatially associate the 3D positions of the identified calcium binding sites within the framework of this work with reported pathogenic variants in the CJB2 gene. This study presents a first step on finding associations between molecular features and pathological variants of the Cx26 hemichannel.",

The productivity of the crop decreases drastically when it encounters various abiotic stresses, most common of which are heat, drought, flood and salinity. There is a crucial role of stress response proteins for the survival of the crops in stress conditions. So the study of wheat stress response proteins is of great importance to raise wheat production in different stress conditions. In this study, we analysed 14-3-3 protein, a stress response protein that is expressed in three major stresses, for example heat, drought and salinity and helps the plants to survive in those conditions. Effect of mutations in the 14-3-3 sequence was predicted using its domain, secondary structure and multiple sequence alignment of amino acid sequences from wheat and its related species. The functional diversity of the protein in different species was correlated with mutations, change in secondary structure and the evolutionary relatedness of the protein in different species. This is the first novel work for analysing the mutational effect on the structure and function of a stress response protein (14-3-3) from Triticum aestivum and its related species.",

It is of great significance to mine epistatic interactions from large-scale data for the combinatorial explosion problem of loci. Hence, it is necessary to improve an efficient algorithm for solving the problem. In this article, a novel ant colony optimization based on automatic adjustment mechanism (AA-ACO) is proposed. The mechanism automatically adjusts the behaviour of artificial ants according to the real-time feedback information so that the algorithm can run at its best.

The new focus of the WHO roadmap on 'transmission control, wherever possible’ offers drug development opportunities for intermediate-host control to prevent human-to-snail-to-human parasite transmission. Reports on the analysis of the impact of ‘chemical-based mollusciciding’ have concluded that constant application of molluscicides may contribute significantly towards the elimination of schistosomiasis in endemic areas. In South-Western Nigeria, Tetrapleura tetraptera is a tree whose fruit has been widely used in snail vector control. The presence of molluscicidal N-acetyl triterpene glycosides in the fruit has been reported. In this study, a bioactivity-directed fractionation of the fruit extract was performed to isolate the most potent molluscicidal saponin from the fruit. In an attempt to provide mechanistic insight into the observed activity, in silico screening was performed, profiling the molluscicidal N-acetyl triterpene glycosides reported from the fruit against two potential therapeutic targets in the mollusk used, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NAD1) and retinoid X receptor. The docking predicted binary complexes of the saponins, which were subjected to explicit solvent conformational sampling from which patterns of structural stability were obtained. The binding energies alone did not account for the potency of the saponins indicating the influence of other factor like pharmacokinetic parameters. The study concluded that there is a preferential suitability of ND1’s MWFE site for the rational design and development of novel molluscicidal agents.",

     "abstract": "Genes interact with each other and may cause perturbation in the molecular pathways leading to complex diseases. Often, instead of any single gene, a subset of genes interact, forming a network, to share common biological functions. Such a subnetwork is called a functional module or motif. Identifying such modules and central key genes in them, that may be responsible for a disease, may help design patient-specific drugs. In this study, we consider the neurodegenerative Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and identify potentially responsible genes from functional motif analysis. We start from the hypothesis that central genes in genetic modules are more relevant to a disease that is under investigation and identify hub genes from the modules as potential marker genes. Motifs or modules are often non-exclusive or overlapping in nature. Moreover, they sometimes show intrinsic or hierarchical distributions with overlapping functional roles. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work handles both the situations in an integrated way.We propose a non-exclusive clustering approach, CluViaN (Clustering Via Network) that can detect intrinsic as well as overlapping modules from gene co-expression networks constructed using microarray expression profiles. We compare our method with existing methods to evaluate the quality of modules extracted. CluViaN reports the presence of intrinsic and overlapping motifs in different species not reported by any other research. We further apply our method to extract significant AD specific modules using CluViaN and rank them based the number of genes from a module involved in the disease pathways. Finally, top central genes are identified by topological analysis of the modules. We use two different AD phenotype data for experimentation. We observe that central genes, namely PSEN1, APP, NDUFB2, NDUFA1, UQCR10, PPP3R1 and a few more, play significant roles in the AD. Interestingly, our experiments also find a hub gene, PML, which has recently been reported to play a role in plasticity, circadian rhythms and the response to proteins which can cause neurodegenerative disorders. MUC4, another hub gene that we find experimentally is yet to be investigated for its potential role in AD.

In this context the Bcl-2 family of anti-and pro-apoptotic proteins provide an excellent opportunity for development of anticancer agents, as blocking the Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL functionally promotes apoptosis in tumor cells and also sensitize them to chemo- and radiotherapies. The present study reports the identification of novel Aplysin analogs as BCL-2 inhibitors from a sequential virtual screening approach using drug-like, ADMET, docking, pharmacophore filters and molecular dynamics simulation.

The correct identification of the functional SNPs of such genes is important for characterizing the functional aspect of these SNPs which can be assessed by evaluating their significant influence on the structure and function of proteins. Since the presence of SNPs in these genes affects the quality of life of a breast cancer patient, thus, the associated diagnostic markers have a reliable potential for assessing the prognosis of breast cancer. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) genes have been shown to obstruct the treatment of breast cancer by providing resistance to malignant cells from anti-cancer drugs. Some allelic variants of ABCG2 and ABCB1 are also associated with occurrence of skin toxicity during the treatment of breast cancer with anti-cancer drugs. The present study has incorporated comprehensive bioinformatics analysis to explore the possible disease-associated mutations of ABCB1 gene, a gene that resulted from gene-environment interaction study, and understand their consequential effect on the structural and functional behavior of P-glycoprotein. Two gene variants (R538S and M701R) of P-glycoprotein were selected as potentially detrimental point mutations, and these variants were modeled. Molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) studies unraveled the atomic interactions and motion trajectories of the native as well as the two mutant (R538S and M701R) structures and were predicted to have a deleterious effect on breast cancer associated P-gp. Thus, the present study may broaden the way to design novel potent drugs for overcoming the problems associated with multidrug resistance (MDR) resulting from a change in protein conformation due to a mutation in ABCB1 gene.",

Structural variations in the CagA structure can alter its affinity with the host proteins, inducing differences in the pathogenicity of H. pylori.

We generated complete structural models of CagA using different conformations of the C-terminal region for two H. pylori strains. These models contain the same EPIYA (ABC1C2) motifs but different level of pathogenicity: gastric cancer and duodenal ulcer. Using these structural models we evaluated the pathogenicity level of the H. pylori strain, based on the affinity of the interaction with SHP-2 and Grb2 receptors and on the number of interactions with the EPIYA motif. We found that the main differences in the interaction was due to the contributions of certain types of energies from each strain and not from the total energy of the molecule.

Some candidate disease genes are identified using many machine learning methods Although there are some differences in these methods including feature vector of genes, the method used to selecting reliable negative data (non-disease genes), and the classification method, the lack of negative data is the most significant challenge of them. Recently, candidate disease genes are identified by semi-supervised learning methods based on positive and unlabeled data. These methods are reasonably accurate and achieved more desirable results versus preceding methods. In this article, we propose a novel Positive Unlabeled (PU) learning technique based upon clustering and One-Class classification algorithm.

Next, we attempt to identify and rank the candidate disease genes using a binary classifier based on support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method yields to the best results, that is 92.8, 93.6, and 93.1 in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure respectively. Compared to the existing methods, the increase of performances of our proposed method is 11.7 percent better than the best method in terms of F-measure.

Uncontrolled expression of this enzyme is responsible for overproduction and deposition of uric acid in blood that is potentially injurious because it can breakdown DNA and protein molecules, triggering many diseases. Human Xanthine oxidoreductase (HsXOR) is considered to be a pharmacological target for the treatment of hyperuricemia. Many of the HsXOR-inhibitor drugs such as Febuxostat and Allopurinol are known to have significant adverse effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new HsXOR-inhibitor drugs with less or no toxicity for the long-term treatment or prevention of hyperuricemia-related diseases. Many nutritious and medical functions have been reported in millets. Present work deals with identification of millet derived compounds in terms of their interaction with target, HsXOR through molecular docking and dynamic simulation studies. Of thirty two chosen compounds, Luteolin and Quercitin showed more binding affinity with HsXOR than reference drugs, Febuxostat and Allopurinol. Molecular dynamics simulations (20 ns long) revealed that Luteolin-protein complex was energetically more stable than Quercitin-protein complex. The millet derived compounds i.e. Luteolin and Quercitin showed binding energy −9.7 kcal/mol whereas the known drugs i.e. Febuxostat and Allopurinol showed binding energy −8.0 kcal/mol and −5.5 kcal/mol respectively.

Vaccination is a complementary plan, along with antibiotic therapy, for clearance of H. pylori. Today, Computer based tools are essential for the evaluation, design, and experiment for novel chimeric targets for immunological administration. The purpose of this experiment was immunoinformatic analysis of UreB and HpaA molecules in a fusion arrangement and also, construction and expression of recombinant protein containing chimeric sequences. The targets sequences were screened by using of standard in silico tools and immunoinformatic web servers. The high-resolution 3D models of the protein were created and were validated; indeed, the B-and T-cell restricted epitopes were mapped on the chimeric protein. The recombinant protein in frame of the expression vector pET28a were expressed and purified successfully. The urease activity and immunoblotting were performed in vitro condition. This study confirmed that the engineered protein as a highly conserved, hydrophilic, non-allergenic contained remarkable B-cell and T-cell epitopes. It was magnificently attained; chimeric UreB229-561-HpaA could provoke both humoral and cellular immunity. The immunoblotting was shown that the chimeric protein could be detected by serum of immunized animal and H.pylori positive patients. In this study, several antigenic patches from UreB and HpaA were identified that could be an efficient immune system activator. The in vitro analysis of our chimeric molecule confirmed its urease activity. It also confirmed that the chimeric protein could be detected by serum of immunized animal and H.pylori positive patients.",

     "abstract": "LKB1 protein is involved in the regulation of cell polarity by phosphorylating the AMPK under energetic stress conditions. LKB1 protein is expressed in both cytoplasm and nucleus. In the nucleus, LKB1 interacts with orphan nuclear receptor protein Nur77. It is reported that the interaction of LKB1 with Nur77 is disrupted by the small molecular ligand TMPA (ethyl 2-[2,3,4-trimethoxy-6-(1-octanoyl)phenyl]acetate), such that the LKB1 is enabled to play its role in cytoplasm and further to regulate/reduce the blood glucose level. In the present study, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are performed to understand the dissociation mechanism of Nur77-LKB1 complex. The present study reveals that TMPAs induce an open-close motion of Nur77 which further decrease the stability of Nur77-LKB1 complex. As a consequence, the interface region in LKB1-Nur77 complex is more exposed for solvation and further releases the interactions existing between Nur77 and LKB1. Altogether, this study explains the TMPAs mediated Nur77-LKB1 complex dissociation.",

Expansins are proteins located in the cell wall with no catalytic activity. In this context, FaEXPA1 was previously reported to have a high accumulation rate during fruit ripening in three different strawberry cultivars. In order to understand at the molecular level the expansin mechanism mode, a 3D model of FaEXPA1 protein was built by comparative modeling. FaEXPA1 protein model displayed two domains, a cellulose-binding domain with a β-sandwich structure, and a second domain that included a HFD motif with a similar structure to the catalytic core of endoglucanase V from Humicola insolens. Additionally, in the center of the structure, an open groove was formed. Finally, using a cellulose polymer as a ligand, the protein-ligand interaction was evaluated by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. Two MD simulations showed that FaEXPA1 can interact with cellulose via the flat aromatic surface of its binding domain D2, composed mainly of residues Trp99 and Trp225. In addition, FaEXPA1 formed a high number of hydrogen bonds with the glycan chain and the Asn81, Phe114 and Asn211 residues.",

In this paper we take these two aspects into account and present a modelling and simulation approach for multi-scale biochemical networks using Coloured Generalised Hybrid Petri Nets ( G H P N C ). G H P N C are a Petri net class that associates colours to Generalised Hybrid Petri Nets ( G H P N ), which incorporate discrete and continuous places in addition to stochastic and continuous transitions.

The sensitivity of these channels to membrane voltage, temperature and intracellular calcium concentration and their possible role in insulin secretion has made them a focal point in research in the past decade. While experimental researches have confirmed the role of the TRPM5 channels in insulin secretion, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this study, based on the experimental results of other studies, a mathematical description of the TRPM5 channel activity has been proposed which correlates the TRPM5 electrical activity to the voltage and intracellular calcium concentration. The resulting expression has been added to the existing mathematical model of the human β-cell and the enhanced model has been used for investigating the effect of the TRPM5 channel on the β-cell electrical activity. The results of our study show that the TRPM5 influences other ion channel activities through speeding up membrane depolarization. In addition, we have shown that the TRPM5 increases the amplitude and firing rate of action potentials by possibly affecting the Na+ and gamma-Aminobutyric acid related currents. The results also confirm the prominent effect of the TRPM5 channels in glucose-stimulated condition.",

In the present study, diverse inhibitors of JAK1 and JAK3 were considered for the development of ligand-based pharmacophore models, followed by docking analysis to design putative dual inhibitors. The pharmacophore models were generated in PHASE 3.4, and top five models for each target were selected on the basis of survival minus inactive score. The best model for JAK1 (AAADH.25) and JAK3 (ADDRR.142) were selected corresponding to the highest value of Q2test. Both models were employed for the screening of a PHASE database, and subsequently, the retrieved hits were filtered employing molecular docking in JAK1 and JAK3 proteins. The stable interactions between retrieved hits and proteins were confirmed using molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, ADME properties of screened dual inhibitors displaying essential interactions with both proteins were calculated. Thus, the new leads obtained in this way may be prioritized for experimental validation as potential novel therapeutic agents in the treatment of various autoimmune and inflammatory disorders related to JAK1 and JAK3.",

PMCI-RFE can also be used to find different types of informative features to further analyze some biological relationships. The proposed PMCI-RFE method uses the correlation information between the feature space and class encoding space to select informative features based on the idea of orthogonal component projection in the feature space. The experimental results on six widely used benchmark datasets show that PMCI-RFE is a fast and effective method compare to other four state-of-the-art feature selection methods, which indeed can make full use of different protein property information and improve the predictability of protein structural class.",

In the present study, using available bioinformatic tools and databases such as the Cluster Database at High Identity with Tolerance (CD-HIT), the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for proteins (BLASTp), the Database of Essential Genes (DEG), and the DrugBank database, 13 putative drug targets were identified in T. whipplei by subtractive genome analysis that could be targeted with currently available drugs (experimental or approved). Further, a 3D model was generated for one of these putative drug targets, the T. whipplei DNA ligase, and in silico docking was performed with pyridochromanone and adenosine-derived inhibitors using the AutoDock Vina. Additionally, many of the T. whipplei protein sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein database were unknown/uncurated. Using available web servers e.g. the KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS), the BLASTp, the Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool (CDAT) and the Protein families (Pfam), the function/remote/domain homology for nearly 80% of these uncurated protein sequences were annotated.

Strigolactones (SLs) are a class of carotenoid-derived lactones regulating many aspects of plant development and recently recognized as phytohormones with promising anticancer activity. In this study, GR24, a synthetic analog and representative of SLs, induced the expression of phase II detoxifying enzymes such as HO-1 and NQO1 in hepatic and macrophage cell lines under normal and inflammatory conditions, respectively. This effect has been found to be mediated by Nrf2 activation. In silico molecular docking against 16-mer peptide binding site on Keap1 suggested that GR24 may exert its biological activity by interfering with Keap1 and Nrf2 binding. GR24 also displayed remarkably potent inhibitory activity against the production of nitric oxide (NO) and molecular docking analysis on iNOS supported experimental data. Furthermore, GR24 dose dependently suppressed the LPS–induced iNOS expression at both mRNA and protein level. It also significantly decreased IL-1β release, mRNA expression of IL-1β and COX-2, as well as nuclear accumulation of NFҡB at the low micro molar range in LPS-stimulated murine macrophages. GR24 promoted AKT activation in insulin resistant skeletal muscle cells and downregulated the expression of enzymes, PEPCK and G6Pase control the rate limiting steps of gluconeogenesis in hepatic cells. The results of molecular docking and ADMET analyses indicated that GR24 might be classified as druggable molecule in drug design.

Docking is an alternative approach for screening of compounds before actually testing it on animals. It is the best option to predict the energetically favourable binding conformations of ligands in the active site cavity of particular receptor and has gained popularity in the scientiﬁc community to save time and money involved in the drug development process. The use of such techniques is increasing day by day among researchers due to availability of user friendly software’s. Due to this, the number of papers related to docking has dramatically increased over the past decades. A variety of docking software’s are currently available to predict the ligand binding pose in its particular receptor, but there is a lack of knowledge and confidence among scientists regarding accuracy of these softwares. There are many concerns to be taken care of, while carrying out any docking study such as selection of correct binding sites of the target protein, the selection of correct docking pose, lack of clarity over whether the compound is an antagonist or agonist, difficult to get best matching algorithms and scoring schemes. Many compounds show high dock score, but unfortunately fail in pre-clinical studies. These issues ought a chance to because for caution and concern before carrying out docking. Therefore, to ensure correct and effective application of docking techniques, it is necessary to understand the method’s merits, demerits, the scope of application, and interpretation.

Till date, the pathophysiology of IBS is not clearly understood due to complexity of the disease. Current study reveals the underlying mechanism of IBS using systems biological approach. The complexity of IBS was explained by constructing protein-protein interaction (PPI) network from the text mined genes/proteins. PPI network displayed 68822 interactions from 3595 proteins. IBS interactome was mapped with colon tissue interactome which resulted in a sub-network containing 153 genes. Further, MCL algorithm was applied to sub-network to identify six major clusters. These cluster genes are involved in several pathways such as MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and NF-kappa B. The obtained clustered genes were prioritized using differentially expressed transcriptome data of 45 IBS and 45 normal volunteers. Among the differentially expressed genes, FUS, UNC5CL and BCLAF1 were found in the clusters, suggesting that the identified clusters could play a potential role in the regulation of IBS. Further pathway analysis of cluster genes revealed their molecular association with IBS.

     "abstract": "Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) investigation utilizing quantum chemical descriptors under density functional theory is performed to predict the toxicity (pEC50) of a series of polyhalogenated dibenzo-p-furans (PHDFs). PHDFs are very important concern to the researchers due to their presence and diverse effects in the environment. A successful two parameter QSAR model is developed with a combination of a global descriptor known as charge transfer (ΔN) between toxins and biosystem and a local descriptor as Fukui function ( f max + ) for maximum nucleophilic attack at the toxin site. A systematic analysis is performed to identify the electron donation/acceptance nature of the considered PHDF compounds with the choice of a model biosystems comprising five different nucleic acid bases, namely Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, Cytosine and Uracil to identify proper ΔN descriptor. Accordingly, PHDFs are found to be electron acceptors with maximum charge transfer from Guanine and therefore, ΔNG is utilized as the charge transfer parameter for all the toxins in the present work. The selected combination of global and local descriptors (ΔNG and f max + ) are found to predict 93% of the observed toxicity (pEC50) of the PHDFs. The developed QSAR model is tested for two different test sets: PHDFs and polyhalogenated biphenyls (PHBs) with about 90% of prediction of their toxicity values, which confirms the importance of the selected descriptors.",

     "abstract": "Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family members plays a vital role in regulating hormonal function, bone formation, tissue remodeling, and erythropoiesis, cell growth and apoptosis. TGF-β super-family members mediate signal transduction via serine/threonine kinase receptors located on the cell membrane. Variation in expression of the TGF-β type I and II receptors in the cancer cells compromise its tumor suppressor activities which direct to oncogenic functions. The present study was aimed to screen the potent TGF-β type I inhibitors through atom based 3D-QSAR and pharmacophore modelling. For this purpose, we have chosen known TGF-β type I inhibitors from the binding database. The PHASE module of Schrodinger identified the best Pharmacophore model which includes three hydrogen bond acceptors (A), one hydrophobic region (H), and one ring (R) as the structural features. The top pharmacophore model AAAHR.27 was chosen with the R2 value of 0.94 and validated externally using molecules of the test set. Moreover the AAAHR.27 model underwent virtual screening using the molecules from the NCI, ZINC and Maybridge database. The screened molecules were further filtered using molecular docking and ADME properties prediction. Additionally, the 7 lead molecules were compared with a newly identified compound “SB431542” (well known TGF-β type I receptor inhibitor) and Galunisertib, a small molecule inhibitor of TGF-β type I, under clinical development (phase II trials) using the docking score and other binding properties. Also a top scored screened molecule from our study has been compared and confirmed using molecular dynamic simulation studies. By this way, we have obtained 7 distinct drug-like TGF-β type I inhibitors which can be beneficial in suppressing cancers reported with up-regulation of TGF-β type I. This result highlights the guidelines for designing molecules with TGF-β Type I inhibitory properties.",

Phytochemical composition was determined by HPLC-DAD and in silico approach used to provide additional insight of the possible interaction of the identified phenolic compounds with the studied enzymes. The methanol extract showed potent inhibitory action against acetylcholinesterase (1.55 mg GALAE/g extract), tyrosinase (61.61 mg KAE/g extract), and glucosidase (20.17 mmol ACAE/g extract). The methanol extract of O. argyrea exhibited potent radical scavenging potential (126.51 mg TE/g extract for DPPH scavenging assay) and reducing capacities (311.36 and 200.70 mg TE/g extract, for CUPRAC and FRAP assays, respectively). Quercetin, apigenin, and benzoic acid were identified in significant amounts in the methanol extract of O. argyrea. Quercetin interacted with the catalytic pocket of glucosidase by establishing hydrogen bonds with Ser157, Ser241, Asp307, and π-π interactions with His280 and Tyr158. The observed inhibitory effects of O. argyrea extracts on the studied enzyme suggest that this plant could be a promising source of naturally occurring chemical compounds for the management of diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, skin hyperpigmentation disorders, as well as, oxidative stress-related complications.",

Direct or indirect interactions with RTKs (shortest path of 2) were often associated with resistance to RTKs inhibitors in the literature. The results based on the KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated the Rap1 signal pathway would also contribute to the resistance of RTKs inhibitor as well as the known Ras pathway and PI3K/Akt pathway. The pathways can crosstalk within and between complex signals transduction networks, then activate the upstream or downstream pathway, and/or activate the other oncogenes, which lead to the acquired resistance.

Molecular docking and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) were performed based on a series of tetracyclic oxindole derivatives to elucidate key structural properties affecting inhibitory activity and support the design of new α-glucosidase inhibitors. The molecular docking results demonstrate that at least two hydrogen bonds between Thr681 and Arg676 residues and the oxygen atoms in amid groups have an important role in the optimum binding of inhibitors. In addition, the sum of polar contacts of Arg699, Arg670, Glu792 and Glu301 residues with the α-glucosidase inhibitors have more than one third of total binding free energy. The docked conformations of the inhibitors with the best binding free energy were used to construct QSAR models. As a primary survey and a graphical comparing tool, the partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) technique was successfully employed to classify active and inactive inhibitors. The validated QSAR analysis were performed through genetic algorithm-partial least squares (GA-PLS) and support vector machine (SVM) techniques. The QSAR model reveals that important features of J3D, Mor26 u and HOMA have a high predictive capability (R2p = 0.837, Q2LOO = 0.871, R2LSO = 0.790 and r2m  = 0.758) using GA-PLS/SVM strategy. Generally, the suggested QSAR analysis based on classification, docking and GA-PLS/SVM strategy may help suggest chemical scaffold to design novel oxindole derivatives as α-glucosidase inhibitors.",

We summarize this analysis in terms of TA locus, accession identifier, hits in conserved domain database, toxin superfamily, antitoxin superfamily and chromosomal/mobile genome/plasmid occurrences. Moreover, for TA context analyses we use six different specifications namely virulence factors, mobile genetic elements (MGE), antibiotic resistance genes, secretion systems, prophage and a classification of mobile genetic elements (ACLAME); among these hits are found for only MGE, ACLAME and prophage. A total 39 sets of TA have been discovered in which numbers of TA encoded for MGE, ACLAME and prophage are 15, 15 and 5 respectively while the remaining four have no context hit. In addition, a comparative analysis of TAome was also done with closely related bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii TTO1 (NCBI RefSeq NC_005126) and results shows that a total 8 sets of TA are conserved. Further, a bootstrap Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic tree was also constructed for major toxin protein superfamily found namely RelE, HigB, GNAT, CcdB and MazF explored in the TAome of X. nematophila. We also characterized, the most abundantly found TA module (relBE) in this TAome, functionally and transcriptionally.

These GSCs can undergo reprogramming to transform themselves into pluripotent stem cells, called as Multipotent adult Germline stem cells (maGSCs). The mechanism of the reprogramming of GSCs to maGSCs is elusive. To investigate novel factors that may govern the process of reprogramming, the RNA-seq data of both GSCs and maGSCs were retrieved and subjected to Tuxedo protocol using Galaxy server. Total 1558 differentially expressed genes were identified from the analysis. Protein sequence in the FASTA format of all 1558 differentially expressed genes was retrieved and submitted to Pluripred web server to predict whether the proteins were pluripotent or not. A total of 232 proteins were predicted as pluripotent, and to identify the novel proteins, these were submitted to STRING database to obtain an interaction map. The obtained interaction map was submitted to Cytoscape, and various apps such as MCODE and Centiscape were used to identify the clusters and centrality measures between the nodes of the generated network. Five clusters were identified and ranked according to their score. Novel pluripotent proteins like cadherin related cdh5, cdh10 were predicted.

Dppa2, Sox11, Sox2, Bmp4, Shh, and Otp were predicted to be involved in positive regulation of the stem cell proliferation. Pathway analysis further revealed that signaling pathways such as Wnt, Jak-Stat and PI3K may play important role in the pluripotency of the maGSCs. Novel proteins involved in pluripotency, which were predicted by our findings, can be experimentally researched in future.",

All tested compounds (4a-1; 5a-s) exhibited inhibitory activities against AChE and BChE to a considerable extent. Molecular docking studies were performed by using homology models on both AChE and BChE isoenzymes with the aim of exploring probable binding modes of the most potent inhibitor. In order to evaluate drug likeness of newly tested molecules, we carried out in-silico ADME evaluation. All compounds displayed favourable ADME findings which predict good oral bioavailability of these derivatives.

     "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in regulating the signaling network such as the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. However, the mechanisms of miRNA-mediated posttranscriptional regulations with regard to their impacts on signaling require further investigation from a systematic level. Therefore, we develop a mathematical model by analyzing the precise dynamic mechanisms with a bevy of miRNAs involved in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. A systems-based analysis approach is introduced into this model and the dynamics have been implemented deterministically and stochastically. Our analysis reveals that miRNAs are key participants regulating the gene expression of ERK network, and the cooperative actions of miRNAs are important in keeping the normal biological characteristics and amplification effects of the system. Meanwhile, the appearance of system disorder in the absence of miRNAs suggests that miRNAs may play a role in the pathological processes, such as tumor and inflammation. The sensitivity analysis and the kinetic parameter perturbation show that the binding of receptor (EGFR) and adaptor protein (Shc, Grb2 and Sos) under normal physiological conditions is crucial for the robustness of the whole pathway. In addition, the stochastic dynamic patterns are in a good agreement with the deterministic results, further demonstrating that the variability of the system due to the presence of some stochastic noise is low. All these will be helpful for a deeper understanding of the dynamic mechanism of miRNA-mediated ERK signal network, which might present a rich area of future research with the relevant regulatory roles of miRNAs in cell signaling pathway.",

     "abstract": "The current research is based on computational study of the Death Domain (DD) superfamily of proteins involved in the cytoplasmic inflammasome complexes associated with apoptosis and inflammation in response to the nanoparticle treatment. The PYD domains of the DD superfamily proteins, NALP3 and ASC, were chosen for investigation as they are found to be primarily involved in the regulation of innate immunity and are associated with apoptosis and inflammation. The in-vitro studies of these proteins have proven to be a challenge as the proteins have a tendency to aggregate under laboratory conditions. The interactions between PYD-PYD domains of NALP3 & ASC proteins as well as PYD-PYD domains of NALP3 and ASC2 proteins were studied using the computational tools. In our study, the protein structures were taken from Protein Data Bank, and molecular dynamics simulation was performed using NAMD software followed by molecular docking studies using HADDOCK. The generated protein models were validated using PROCHECK and then the protein-protein interactions were analyzed using the molecular visualization tool CHIMERA. We noticed that the affinity between PYD of NALP3-ASC complex is better when compared to the NALP3-ASC2 complex based on their binding energies and docking scores. In the case of NALP3-ASC complex, seven key amino acids of ASC-PYD protein interface interact with four key amino acids of NALP3-PYD protein interface. However, in the case of NALP3-ASC2 complex, six key amino acids of ASC-PYD protein interact with four key amino acids of NALP3-PYD protein. Although, there is not much difference in the number of interacting amino acid residues between the two protein complexes, we understand that the NALP3-ASC exhibits better binding interaction and stability than the NALP3-ASC2 protein complex because the number of hydrogen bonding between them is more when compared to the latter. The hydrogen bonds between the interacting amino acids of the NALP3-ASC protein interface are 12, whereas it is 6 in the case of NALP3-ASC2 protein interaction. The protein-protein interaction seems to be dominated by the energetically significant hydrogen bonding followed by the electrostatic interaction in the NALP3-ASC protein interface, whereas both hydrogen bonding and the interaction between charged residues appears to play a significant role at the NALP3-ASC2 protein interfaces.",

Data about 2062 drugs are obtained, and mining is performed to filter only those drugs which fulfill Lipinski rule of five. Clustering is performed, and DDIs are built on the clusters to identify effective drug compounds. Only 1052 compounds fulfill Lipinski rule. 12 clusters are formed for 1052 drugs compounds.

However, postoperative nausea and vomiting are common problems in which inhalational agents may have a role in their development. When a mode of action is unknown, QSAR modelling is essential in drug development. To investigate the aspects of their anesthetic, QSAR models based on the Monte Carlo method were developed for a set of polyhalogenated ethers. Until now, their anesthetic action has not been completely defined, although some hypotheses have been suggested. Therefore, a QSAR model should be developed on molecular fragments that contribute to anesthetic action. QSAR models were built on the basis of optimal molecular descriptors based on the SMILES notation and local graph invariants, whereas the Monte Carlo optimization method with three random splits into the training and test set was applied for model development. Different methods, including novel Index of ideality correlation, were applied for the determination of the robustness of the model and its predictive potential. The Monte Carlo optimization process was capable of being an efficient in silico tool for building up a robust model of good statistical quality. Molecular fragments which have both positive and negative influence on anesthetic action were determined. The presented study can be useful in the search for novel anesthetics.",

There are many heuristics to perform multiple sequence alignment, as Progressive Alignment, Ant Colony, Genetic Algorithms, among others. Along the years, some tools were proposed to perform MSA and MSA-GA is one of them. The MSA-GA is a tool based on Genetic Algorithm to perform multiple sequence alignment and its results are generally better than other well-known tools in bioinformatics, as Clustal W. The COFFEE objective function was implemented in the MSA-GA in order to allow it to produce better alignments to less similar sequence sets of proteins. Nonetheless, the COFFEE objective function is not suited do perform multiple sequence alignment of nucleotides. Thus, we have modified the COFFEE objective function, previously implemented in the MSA-GA, to allow it to obtain better results also to sequences of nucleotides. Our results have shown that our approach has achieved better results in all cases when compared with standard COFFEE and most of cases when compared with WSP for all test cases from BAliBase and BRAliBase.

The mapping stage can take up to 40% of overall processing time for genomics pipelines. Our implementation offloads the Seed Extension function, one of the main BWA-MEM computational functions, onto an accelerator.Sequencers typically output reads with a length of 150 base pairs. However, read length is expected to increase in the near future. Here, we investigate the influence of read length on BWA-MEM performance using data sets with read length up to 400 base pairs, and introduce methods to ameliorate the impact of longer read length. For the industry-standard 150 base pair read length, our implementation achieves an up to two-fold increase in overall application-level performance for systems with at most twenty-two logical CPU cores. Longer read length requires commensurately bigger data structures, which directly impacts accelerator efficiency. The two-fold performance increase is sustained for read length of at most 250 base pairs.To improve performance, we perform a classification of the inefficiency of the underlying systolic array architecture. By eliminating idle regions as much as possible, efficiency is improved by up to +95%. Moreover, adaptive load balancing intelligently distributes work between host and accelerator to ensure use of an accelerator always results in performance improvement, which in GPU-constrained scenarios provides up to +45% more performance.",

The over accumulation of ACh after NA exposure leads to cholinergic toxicity, seizure, and death. Current medical countermeasures effectively mitigate peripheral symptoms, however; the brain is often unprotected. Alternative acute treatment with the adenosine A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclopentyladensosine (CPA) has previously been demonstrated to prevent AChE inhibition as well as to suppress neuronal activity. The mechanism of AChE protection is unknown. To elucidate the feasibility of potential CPA-AChE interaction mechanisms, we applied a truncated molecular model approach and density functional theory. The candidate mechanisms studied are reversible enzyme inhibition, enzyme reactivation, and NA blocking prior to enzyme conjugation. Our thermodynamic data suggest that CPA can compete with the NAs sarin and soman for the active site of AChE, but may, in contrast to NAs, undergo back-reaction. We found a strong interaction between CPA and NA conjugated AChE, making enzyme reactivation unlikely but possibly allowing for CPA protection through the prevention of NA aging. The data also indicates that there is an affinity between CPA and unbound NAs. The results from this study support the hypothesis that CPA counters NA toxicity via multiple mechanisms and is a promising therapeutic strategy that warrants further development.",

These interactions are in turn influenced by various biophysical properties of the amino acids. There are several examples of proteins that share the same fold but are very dissimilar at the sequence level. For proteins to share a common fold some crucial interactions should be maintained despite insignificant sequence similarity. Since the interactions are because of the biophysical properties of the amino acids, we should be able to detect descriptive patterns for folds at such a property level. In this line, the main focus of our research is to analyze such proteins and to characterize them in terms of their biophysical properties. Protein structures with sequence similarity lesser than 40% were selected for ten different subfolds from three different mainfolds (according to CATH classification) and were used for this analysis. We used the normalized values of the 49 physio-chemical, energetic and conformational properties of amino acids. We characterize the folds based on the average biophysical property values. We also observed a fold specific correlational behavior of biophysical properties despite a very low sequence similarity in our data. We further trained three different binary classification models (Naive Bayes-NB, Support Vector Machines-SVM and Bayesian Generalized Linear Model-BGLM) which could discriminate mainfold based on the biophysical properties.

     "abstract": "The present paper deals with in silico evaluation of 32 virtually designed transition metal complexes of 2-butanone thiosemicarbazone and N,S,O containing donor hetero-ligands namely py, bpy, furan, thiophene, 2-picoline, 1,10-phenanthroline, piperazine and liquid ammonia. The complexes were designed with a view to assess their potential anticancer, antioxidant and antibacterial activity. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) properties of the chosen ligands were calculated by admetSAR software. Metabolic sites of different ligands likely to undergo metabolism were predicted using Metaprint 2D. The proposed complexes were also evaluated for their drug-like quality based on Lipinski’s, Veber, Ghose and leadlikeness filters. Druglikeness and toxicity potential were predicted by OSIRIS property explorer. The pharmacokinetic properties and bioactivity scores were calculated by Molinspiration tool. Bioactivity scores of the complexes were predicted for drug targets including enzymes, nuclear receptors, kinase inhibitors, G-protein coupled receptor ligands and ion channel modulators. Molecular docking of selected Fe(II) mixed-ligand complexes was performed using AutoDock version 4.2.6 and i-GEMDOCK version 2.1 with two target proteins namely Ribonucleotide reductase (RR) and Topoisomerase II (Topo II). The results were compared with three standard reference drugs viz. Doxorubicin HCl, Letrozole (anticancer) and Tetracycline (antibiotic). Multivariate data obtained were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) for visualization and projection as scatter and 3D plots. Positive results obtained for hetero-ligands using admetSAR version 1.0 indicated good absorption and transport kinetics of the hetero-ligand complexes through the human intestine and blood-brain barrier. The hetero-ligands were predicted to have no associated mutagenic effect(s) also. However, none of the hetero-ligands was predicted to be Caco-2 (human colon cancer cell line) permeable. Most of the hetero-ligands and the parent ligand (2-butanone thiosemicarbazone) were predicted to undergo Phase-I metabolism prior to excretion using MetaPrint2D software. Pharmacokinetic evaluation of the proposed complexes revealed that all complexes displayed drug-like character and were predicted to have no apparent toxic side-effects. All the proposed complexes showed moderate to good biological activity scores (−5.0 to 0.0). Mixed complexes with bpy, 2-picoline and 1,10-phenanthroline showed significant bioactivity scores (as enzyme inhibitors) in the range 0.02–0.13. Likewise, good docking scores were obtained for Fe (II) complexes with the same ligands. [FeL(2-pic)2] displayed the lowest binding energy (−6.47 kcal/mol) with respect to Topo II followed by [FeL(py)2] (−6.14 kcal/mol) as calculated by AutoDock version 4.2.6. With respect to binding with RR, [FeL(2--pic)2] again displayed the lowest binding energy (−7.21 kcal/mol) followed by [FeL(py)2] (−5.96 kcal/mol). On the basis of docking predictions and various other computational evaluations, four mixed-ligand complexes of Fe in +2 oxidation state with py, bpy, 2--picoline and 1,10-phenanthroline were synthesized with 2-butanone thiosemicarbazone. All the synthesized Fe complexes were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques and tested for their potential anticancer activity in vitro against human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB 231 and human lung carcinoma cell line A549 cell line using MTT assay. [FeL(2-pic)2], [FeL(bpy)], and [FeL(py)2] were found to exhibit significant antiproliferative activity with IC50 values in the range of 80–100 μM against breast and lung cancer cells. The synthesized Fe complexes also displayed mild antioxidant activities. The synthesized and studied Fe complexes have the potential for development into future anticancer agents if analyzed and modified further for improvement of their ADMET, solubility and permeability criteria set for potential drug-candidates.",

     "abstract": "Protein kinase inhibitors have been widely used as therapeutic agents to treat a variety of diseases, but many of them may cause off-target effects by unexpectedly targeting other noncognate kinases due to high conversion across the protein kinase family. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway plays an essential role in tumorigenesis, which has been recognized as a high priority in the druggable target candidates of anticancer therapy. Here, we attempt to investigate the untargeted kinase–inhibitor interactions (UKIIs) of kinase-targeted therapies for the cancer MAPK signaling cascade via an integration of biomolecular modeling, cell viability assay and kinase inhibition analysis. A systematic kinase–inhibitor interaction profile is created for 28 FDA-approved kinase inhibitor drugs across 9 caner-related MAPK kinases. The created profile is analyzed at structural, energetic and dynamic levels and, consequently, totally 18 promising UKII pairs with high theoretical affinity are derived, from which the noncognate inhibitors Cabozantinib, Regorafenib and Crizotinib are selected to test their cytotoxic effects on human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cell line and inhibition activity against the recombinant protein of human p38α kinase domain. The obtained results are compared with two cognate MAPK inhibitors JNK-IN-8 and BIRB796. As might be expected, the Regorafenib, Crizotinib and Cabozantinib exhibit high, moderate and low cytotoxicities, respectively. In addition, the Regorafenib is determined to have a potent p38α-inhibitory activity. This is basically in line with the test results of positive controls JNK-IN-8 and BIRB796 and can be well confirmed by computational modeling.",

In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to unravel changes in the MERS CoV heptad repeat domains (HRs) and factors affecting fusion state HR stability. Results indicated that HR trimer is more rapidly stabilized, having stable system energy and lower root mean square deviations (RMSDs). While trimers were the predominant active form of CoVs HRs, monomers were also discovered in both of viral and cellular membranes. In order to find the differences between S2 monomer and trimer molecular dynamics, S2 monomer was modelled and subjected to MD simulation. In contrast to S2 trimer, S2 monomer was unstable, having high RMSDs with major drifts above 8 Å. Fluctuation of HR residue positions revealed major changes in the C-terminal of HR2 and the linker coil between HR1 and HR2 in both monomer and trimer. Hydrophobic residues at the a and d positions of HR helices stabilize the whole system, with minimal changes in RMSD. The global distance test and contact area difference scores support instability of MERS CoV S2 monomer. Analysis of HR1-HR2 inter-residue contacts and interaction energy revealed three energy scales along HR helices. Two strong interaction energies were identified at the start of the HR2 helix and at the C-terminal of HR2. The identified critical residues by MD simulation and residues at the a and d positions of HR helix were strong stabilizers of HR recognition.",

     "abstract": "The mechanism of action of the selenenamide 1 as a mimic of the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was investigated by the density functional theory. The solvent-assisted proton exchange procedure was applied to model the catalytic behavior and antioxidant activity of this mimic. To have an insight into the charge transfer effect, different aromatic thiols, including electron donating substituents on the phenyl ring were considered. The catalytic behavior of the selenenamide was modeled in a four-step mechanism, described by the oxidation of the mimic, the reduction of the obtained product, selenoxide, the reduction of the selenenylsulfide and dehydration of selenenic acid. On the basis of the activation parameters, the final step of the proposed mechanism is the rate determining states of the catalytic cycle. Turnover frequency (TOF) analysis showed that the electron donating groups at the para-position of the phenyl ring of the PhSH do not affect the catalytic activity of the selenenamide in contrast to p-methyl thiophenol which indicates the highest nucleophilicity. The evaluation of the electronic contribution of the various donating groups on the phenyl ring of the aromatic thiols shows that the antioxidant activity of the selenenamide sufficiently increases in the presence of the electron-donating substitutions. Finally, the charge transfer process at the rate-determining state was investigated based on the natural bond orbital analysis.",

It is characterized by high blood pressure and symptoms that are indicative of damage to other organ systems, most often involving the liver and kidneys. If left untreated, the condition could be fatal to mother and baby. This makes it important to delineate the complexities associated with the disease at a molecular level that would help develop methods for early diagnosis. In microarray-based studies, Textoris et al. and Mirzakhani et al. have analyzed the transcriptome with a view to identify biomarkers for preeclampsia. The current study has extensively analyzed these microarray data sets to understand the complexity and heterogeneity associated with preeclampsia. A statistical multiple comparisons-based approach has been used to identify features capable of distinguishing preeclampsia from normotensive cases. These features were then used to build an artificial neural network-based machine learning model that successfully classified the samples. Further, the machine learning model was used to delineate features critical for its internal representation by extending the calliper randomization approach to the analysis of microarray data. Functional analysis of the features identified by the calliper randomization approach revealed pathways that could be crucially involved in the mechanism of the underlying disease. Biological processes associated with the features identified have revealed among others, genes involved in reproductive processes to be differentially expressed.",

Thus, the present work is aimed at identification of potential leads as sEH inhibitors which will sustain the beneficial properties of EETs in vivo. PubChem and ZINC databases were screened for drug-like compounds based on Lipinski’s rule of five and in silico toxicity filters. The binding potential of the drug-like compounds with sEH was explored using molecular docking. The top ranked lead (ZINC23099069) showed higher GOLD score compared with that of the control, 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-dodecanoic acid butyl ester (AUDA-BE) and displayed two hydrogen bonds with Tyr383 and His420 and eleven residues involved in hydrophobic interactions with sEH. The apo_sEH and sEH_ZINC23099069 complex showed stable trajectories during 20 ns time scale of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) binding free energy analysis showed that electrostatic energy is the driving energy component for interaction of the lead with sEH.

In fact, there has been no proper antigen to act as an effective immunogenic substance against this ubiquitous pathogen in the market as yet. The complications caused by this bacterium due to the rapid development of multiple drug resistant strains have led to clinical problems worldwide. P. aeruginosa encodes many specific virulence elements that could be used as appropriate vaccine candidates. Type Vd secretion system, also known as patatin-like protein D, is a novel P. aeruginosa auto-transporter system. It is known that cellular or humoral immune responses could be elevated by chimeric proteins carrying epitopes. It has been recognized that in silico tools are essential for the evaluation of new chimeric antigens.In this study, we have considered the patatin-like protein D (PlpD) molecule from P. aeruginosa and predicted some immunogenic properties of this strong cytotoxic phospholipase A2 with the use of in-depth computational and immunoinformatics assessment methods The novelty of our in silico study is the modeling and assessment of both humoral and cellular immune potential against the PlpD molecule. The molecule was considered by multiple sequence alignment and homology valuation. The extremely conserved regions in the PlpD were predicted. The allergenic and physicochemical property predictions on the PlpD state that the molecule is a non-allergic and stable molecule. High-resolution secondary and tertiary conformations were created. Indeed, the B-cell and T-cell epitope mapping on the chimeric target protein confirmed that the engineered protein contained a tremendous number of both B-cell and T-cell corresponding epitopes. This investigation magnificently attained the chimeric molecule as being a potent lipolytic enzyme composed of numerous B-cell and T-cell restricted epitopes and could induce both humoral and cellular immune responses.

Four pathways were proposed for PRPP and OA binding differing in the sequence of PRPP, OA and Mg2+ ion complexation with OPRT.

Formation of PRPP-OPRT complex was found to be energetically not probable rendering the pathway requiring Mg2+-OA complex not probable. Further, PRPP migration towards the active site was found to be energetically not favoured rendering the pathway involving Mg2+-OA complexation improbable. Migration of OA and Mg2+-PRPP complex towards the active site was found to be energetically probable with a large stabilization of the system when Mg2+-PRPP complex bound to the OA-OPRT complex.

The temperature effect was evaluated in terms of root mean square deviation of the backbone atoms and root mean square fluctuation of the coordinating residue atoms. The stability of the zinc coordination sphere was analyzed based upon the time profile of the interatomic distances between the zinc ions and the chelator atoms. The results indicate that the hydrophobic character of the proximal zinc finger is dominant at 333 K. The low mobility of the coordinating residues suggests that the strong electrostatic effect exerted by the zinc ion on its coordinating residues is not influenced by the increase in temperature. The evolution of the structural parameters of the coordination sphere of the distal zinc finger at 300 K gives us a reasonable picture of the unfolding pathway, as proposed by Bombarda and coworkers (Bombarda et al., 2005), which can predict the binding order of the four conserved ligand-binding residues. Our results support the conclusion that the structural features can vary significantly between the two zinc knuckles of MMTV NC.",

     "abstract": "Sirtuin4 (Sirt4) is one of the mammalian homologues of Silent information regulator 2 (Sir2), which promotes the longevity of yeast, C. elegans, fruit flies and mice. Sirt4 is localized in the mitochondria, where it contributes to preventing the development of cancers and ischemic heart disease through regulating energy metabolism. The ADP-ribosylation of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), which is catalyzed by Sirt4, downregulates the TCA cycle. However, this reaction mechanism is obscure, because the structure of Sirt4 is unknown. We here constructed structural models of Sirt4 by homology modeling and threading, and docked nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide+ (NAD+) to Sirt4. In addition, a partial GDH structure was docked to the Sirt4-NAD+ complex model. In the ternary complex model of Sirt4-NAD+-GDH, the acetylated lysine 171 of GDH is located close to NAD+. This suggests a possible mechanism underlying the ADP-ribosylation at cysteine 172, which may occur through a transient intermediate with ADP-ribosylation at the acetylated lysine 171. These results may be useful in designing drugs for the treatment of cancers and ischemic heart disease.",

In silico models have been developed in order to have a close insight regarding features of the molecular fragments that may affect the activity of the molecules conducively. The biological pharmacophore of the inhibitors that accounts for their interaction with the tyrosinase enzyme has been ascertained based on the development of a 3D pharmacophore model. The models thus developed were subsequently utilised for screening a set of compounds that were previously synthesised in-house and were reported to possess antioxidant activity. The final selection of active molecules in the screening process was done based on the docking interactions of the molecules with the tyrosinase enzyme and assessment of their degree of binding to the protein.

It is involved in nosocomial infections. In the current study, potential novel drug targets against P. aeruginosa have been identified using core proteomic analysis and Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) studies. The non-redundant reference proteome of 68 strains having complete genome and latest assembly version of P. aeruginosa were downloaded from ftp NCBI RefSeq server in October 2016. The standalone CD-HIT tool was used to cluster ortholog proteins (having >=80% amino acid identity) present in all strains. The pan-proteome was clustered in 12,380 Clusters of Orthologous Proteins (COPs). By using in-house shell scripts, 3252 common COPs were extracted out and designated as clusters of core proteome. The core proteome of PAO1 strain was selected by fetching PAO1’s proteome from common COPs. As a result, 1212 proteins were shortlisted that are non-homologous to the human but essential for the survival of the pathogen. Among these 1212 proteins, 321 proteins are conserved hypothetical proteins. Considering their potential as drug target, those 321 hypothetical proteins were selected and their probable functions were characterized. Based on the druggability criteria, 18 proteins were shortlisted. The interacting partners were identified by investigating the PPIs network using STRING v10 database. Subsequently, 8 proteins were shortlisted as ‘hub proteins’ and proposed as potential novel drug targets against P. aeruginosa. The study is interesting for the scientific community working to identify novel drug targets against MDR pathogens particularly P. aeruginosa.",

Currently, freely available 3D-QSAR methods suffer the limitations like complex methodologies, difficulty in the analysis of results, applying the statistical methods and validations of models built. Present work describes simple and novel 3D-QSAR methodology, which uses bash scripts LQTA_R_LJ, LQTA_R_QQ and LQTA_R_HB using freely available R statistical program. These scripts then generate Leenard-Jones, Coulomb and Hydrogen bond descriptors. These descriptors provide the steric 3D property, electrostatic property and hydrogen bond formation capacity respectively. These scripts have been tested for the set of DGAT1 inhibitors and results showed that the 3D-QSAR models built have better predictive abilities in terms of R2 0.735, Q2loo 0.635 and R2ext 0.715. The 3D-QSAR model suggested that the substitutions of the alkyl group at the oxadiazolyl ring at the 6th position of the pyrrolo-pyridazine ring is undesirable, on the contrary, substituted phenyl ring at 7th position is responsible for the improved DGAT1 inhibitory activity. The analysis also suggested that 6th position could be substituted with the oxadiazolyl ring or analogous heterocyclic rings, where the 3rd position of such heterocyclic rings substituted with rigid hydrophobic substitute can improve DGAT1 activity.",

However, to date, there is no consensus yet on the single enhancer marker that can be employed to ultimately distinguish and uncover enhancers from the enormous genomic regions. Many supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised computational approaches had emerged to complement and facilitate experimental approaches in enhancer discovery. In this review, we placed our focus on the recently emerged enhancer predictor tools that work on general enhancer features such as sequences, chromatin states and histone modifications, eRNA and of multiple feature approach.

Most of the current methods require information about the interaction of genes or proteins to construct genetic network connection. However, the conclusion of these methods may be bias because of the current incompleteness of human interactome. In this paper, we propose an efficient strategy to use gene expression data and gene mutation data for identifying cancer-related key genes based on graph entropy (iKGGE). Firstly, we construct a gene network using only gene expression data based on the sparse inverse covariance matrix, then, cluster genes use the algorithm of parallel maximal cliques for quickly obtaining a series of subgraphs, and at last, we introduce a novel metric that combine graph entropy and the influence of upstream gene mutations information to measure the impact factors of genes. Testing of the three available cancer datasets shows that our strategy can effectively extract key genes that may play distinct roles in tumorigenesis, and the cancer patient risk groups are well predicted based on key genes.",

Third-generation EGFR TKIs against the T790M mutation has been in active clinical development to triumph the resistance problem; they covalently bind with conserved Cys797 inside the EGFR active site, offering both potency and kinase-selectivity. Third generation drugs target C797, which makes the C797S resistance mutation more subtle. EGFR C797S mutation was accounted to be a main mechanism of resistance to the third-generation inhibitors. The C797S mutation gives off an impression of being an ideal target for conquering the acquired resistance to the third generation inhibitors.

In the present paper, a three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship (3D-QSAR) and molecular docking were performed to investigate the binding between PIM1 and thiazolidine inhibitors in order to design potent inhibitors. The comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) was developed using twenty-six molecules having pIC50 ranging from 8.854 to 6.011 (IC50 in nM). The best CoMSIA model gave significant statistical quality. The determination coefficient (R2) and Leave-One-Out cross-validation coefficient (Q2) are 0.85 and 0.58, respectively.

In this paper, we report the design and eco-friendly two-step synthesis of novel, fused spiro-pyrazolo[1,5-c]quinazoline derivatives as cholinesterase inhibitors.

The compounds were obtained in high purity, good yields (50–97%), and at varying reaction times. The spiro-compounds were evaluated as acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs/BuChEIs) respectively, and the most potent compound exhibited a moderate AChE inhibitory activity (5f: IC50 = 84 μM).

Currently, inhibition of the proteasome has been validated as a promising approach in anticancer therapy. The 20S core particle of the proteasome harbors β5 subunit which is a crucial active site in proteolysis. Targeting proteasome β5 subunit which is responsible for the chymotrypsin-like activity of small molecules has been regarded as an important way for achieving therapeutics target. In the present study, a series of porphyrin derivatives bearing either pyridine or pyrazole rings as meso-substituents were designed and evaluated as an inhibitor for the β5 subunit of the proteasome by employing molecular docking and dynamics simulations. The molecular docking was performed with the help of AutoDock 4.2, while molecular dynamics simulation was done using AMBER 14. All compounds bound to the proteasome with similar binding modes, and each porphyrin-proteasome complex was stable during 30 ns MD simulation as indicated by root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) value. An analysis on protein residue fluctuation of porphyrin binding demonstrates that in all complexes, porphyrin binding produces minor fluctuation on amino acid residues. The molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) free energy calculation shows that the binding affinities of mono-H2PyP, bis-H2PzP, and tetra-H2PyP were comparable with that of the potential inhibitor, HU10. It is noted that the electrostatic interaction increases with the number of meso-substituents, which was favourable for porphyrin binding. The present study shows that both electrostatic and van der Waals interaction are the main force which controls the interaction of porphyrin compounds with the proteasome.",

In this study we have carried out a study of the functional role of the arginine residue at position 58 in the site RC comprising the reverse turn (8–12) and C-terminal residues 58–64. A polymerase chain reaction was used to substitute this arginine residue with a single amino acid such as alanine, glycine and lysine. The mutants were expressed in soluble form in E. coli, and purified by affinity chromatography. After target peptide purity identification, the recombinant peptides underwent a circular dichroism analysis and a study of their analgesic activity in mice. The results indicated that a single residue modification can affect the pharmacological activity. Our efforts establish a sound basis for further study of the structure-function determinants of the analgesic effect.",

In order to predict the activation mechanism of these pro-mutagens, we designed a computational biochemistry protocol, which includes, docking experiments, molecular dynamics simulations and free energy decomposition calculations to obtain information about the interaction of 2-phenyl-benzotriazole molecules into the active center of cytochrome P450-CYP1A1 (CYP1A1). Molecular docking calculations using AutoDock Vina software shows that PBTAs are proportionally oriented in the pocket of CYP1A1, establishing π-π stacking attractive interactions between the triazole group and the Phe224, as well as, the hydrogen bonds of the terminal NH2 over the benzotriazole units with the Asn255 and Ser116 amino acids. Molecular dynamics simulations using NAMD package showed that these interactions are stable along 100.0 ns of trajectories. Into this context, free binding energy calculations employing the MM-GBSA approach, shows that some differences exists among the interaction of PBTAs with CYP1A1, regarding the solvation, electrostatic and van der Waals interaction energy components. These results suggest that PBTA molecules might be activated by CYP1A1. Thus, enhancing their mutagenicity when compared with the pro-mutagen parent species.",

Understanding and predicting the physical interactions of small molecules with DNA via docking is key not only for the comprehension of molecular-level events that lead to carcinogenesis and other diseases, but also for the rational design of drugs that target DNA. We recently validated AutoDock, a popular docking method that includes a physics-based scoring function and a Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm, for the prediction of small molecule geometries upon physical binding to DNA. In this work, we added a vibrational entropy term based on the docking frequency to the scoring function in order to improve the accuracy of the best (lowest) score geometry. We found that in four small molecule–DNA systems the inclusion of the vibrational entropy term decreased the root-mean-square-deviation from the experimental crystallographic structure. Including the entropy term also preserved the successful prediction of the binding geometry compared to the crystallographic structure for the rest of the small molecule–DNA systems.

UNC3866, is a recently reported peptide-based inhibitor of the methyllysine (Kme) reading function of CBX chromodomains (CBX2, 4 and 6–8). The previous experiments showed that UNC3866 bound the chromodomains of CBX7 strongly, with ∼20-fold selectivity over other CBX chromodomains. However, the potential mechanism of UNC3866 preferentially binding to CBX7 is still unknown. In this study, we performed two pairs of microsecond molecular dynamic simulations (CBX2 (-UNC3866)) and (CBX7 (-UNC3866)) to study the inhibition and isoform-selective mechanism of UNC3866 to CBX7. The conformational analysis of apo- and holo- CBX2 and CBX7 indicated that the aromatic cage of CBX7 protein was more prone to be induced by UNC3866 relative to CBX2 protein. The results of predicted binding free energy suggested the binding affinity of UNC3866 with CBX7 was stronger than that with CBX2, because of the lower binding free energy of the former. Furthermore, the energetic origin of UNC3866 selective for CBX7 protein mainly came from the higher van der Waals contributions. The binding mode analysis showed that Asn47 of CBX2 formed a hydrogen bond with the OH group of C-terminal cap of UNC3866, inducing the conformational changes of diethyllysine of UNC3866 that is obviously different from that in CBX7. Additionally, His39 in CBX2 chromodomain interrupted the structured aromatic cage, partly explaining the reason for UNC3866 preferring for binding to CBX7. The proposal of this selective mechanism could be helpful for the rational design of novel selective inhibitors of the Polycomb CBX protein.",

Out of 1010 samples of the current study, 510 (50.49%) were culture positive of which 329 (64.5%) were Gram-positive while 181 (35.49%) Gram negative. The Gram positive bacterial isolates in the current study were; S. aureus and S. epidermidis while Gram negative were; Citrobacter, P. aeruginosa, Provedencia, E. coli, Proteus, Klebsiella, Shigella and Serratia. In the current study, 50 ESBL and 10 MBL producing isolates were obtained from inanimate objects. The ESBL positive isolates were highly resistant to MEM. Out of 50 ESBL, 2 isolates were resistant to DO, SXT and FEP while 1 was resistant to TZP and CN. The BlaTEM gene was detected in 22 and BlaCTX was detected in 19 ESBL producing isolates. Six of the MBL producing isolates were NDM positive while all of the isolates were AmpC negative. Most of the isolates had more than two resistant genes.

Recently, we published a research article on gene expression profiling of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) that were exposed to ionizing radiation (IR). Single-dose irradiation of tumors could initiate differentially expressed genes in TAM as a time series from irradiated tumors that are associated with the immune response. It is also well known that human cancers are associated with microRNA (miRNA) alterations that are involved in cancer progression. However, the role of miRNA on TAM after exposure to irradiation remains unclear.In this study, miRNA expression profiles from microarrays were used to identify the key miRNAs and correlating pathways involved in the role of TAMs in tumor progression and recurrence after RT. Using a mouse tumor model, we identified miRNA pattern changes over time in response to irradiation. Based on our results, we hypothesize that miRNA expression in the irradiated tumor may be used as a distinguishing marker to indicate the best time for therapeutic intervention to prevent tumor recurrence after RT.We established a murine model irradiated with a single dose of 25 Gy that could initiate temporal changes in the expression of miRNAs associated with cell proliferation and the immune response, as evidenced by macrophages directly extracted from irradiated tumors after two weeks of IR. Statistical analyses were conducted by comparing the miRNA expression in macrophages from non-irradiated versus irradiated tumors. Thus, our study could lead to a better understanding of the function of miRNA expressions, which changed temporally in an irradiated tumor microenvironment.",

     "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce and analyze two graph-based models for assigning orthologs in the presence of whole-genome duplications, using similarity information between pairs of genes. The common feature of our two models is that genes of the first genome may be assigned two orthologs from the second genome, which has undergone a whole-genome duplication. Additionally, our models incorporate the new notion of duplication bonus, a parameter that reflects how assigning two orthologs to a given gene should be rewarded or penalized. Our work is mainly focused on developing exact and reasonably time-consuming algorithms for these two models: we show that the first one is polynomial-time solvable, while the second is NP-hard. For the latter, we thus design two fixed-parameter algorithms, i.e. exact algorithms whose running times are exponential only with respect to a small and well-chosen input parameter. Finally, for both models, we evaluate our algorithms on pairs of plant genomes. Our experiments show that the NP-hard model yields a better cluster quality at the cost of lower coverage, due to the fact that our instances cannot be completely solved by our algorithms. However, our results are altogether encouraging and show that our methods yield biologically significant predictions of orthologs when the duplication bonus value is properly chosen.",

The prediction of protein complexes from protein–protein interaction (PPI) network is usually difficult when the complexes are overlapping with each other in a dense region of the network. To address the problem of predicting overlapping complexes, a previously proposed network–decomposition approach is promising. It decomposes a PPI network by e.g. removing proteins with high degree (hubs) which may participate in different complexes. This motivates us to examine a list of proteins, which bind their different partners at different time or at different location (viz. date hubs), manually collected from literature, for network decomposition. Results show that the CMC complex discovery algorithm after removing date hubs recalls more overlapping complexes that were missed earlier. Further improvement in performance is achieved when we predict date hub proteins based on simple network features and remove them from PPI networks.",

     "abstract": "DNA fingerprinting, also known as DNA profiling, serves as a standard procedure in forensics to identify a person by the short tandem repeat (STR) loci in their DNA. By comparing the STR loci between DNA samples, practitioners can calculate a probability of match to identity the contributors of a DNA mixture. Most existing methods are based on 13 core STR loci which were identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Analyses based on these loci of DNA mixture for forensic purposes are highly variable in procedures, and suffer from subjectivity as well as bias in complex mixture interpretation. With the emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, the sequencing of billions of DNA molecules can be parallelized, thus greatly increasing throughput and reducing the associated costs. This allows the creation of new techniques that incorporate more loci to enable complex mixture interpretation. In this paper, we propose a computation for likelihood ratio that uses NGS (next generation sequencing) data for DNA testing on mixed samples. We have applied the method to 4480 simulated DNA mixtures, which consist of various mixture proportions of 8 unrelated whole-genome sequencing data. The results confirm the feasibility of utilizing NGS data in DNA mixture interpretations. We observed an average likelihood ratio as high as 285,978 for two-person mixtures.

Existing models are dependent on feature extraction and selection for capturing splicing signals lying in the vicinity of splice junctions. But such manually extracted features are not exhaustive. We introduce distributed feature representation, SpliceVec, to avoid explicit and biased feature extraction generally adopted for such tasks. SpliceVec is based on two widely used distributed representation models in natural language processing. Learned feature representation in form of SpliceVec is fed to multilayer perceptron for splice junction classification task. An intrinsic evaluation of SpliceVec indicates that it is able to group true and false sites distinctly. Our study on optimal context to be considered for feature extraction indicates inclusion of entire intronic sequence to be better than flanking upstream and downstream region around splice junctions. Further, SpliceVec is invariant to canonical and non-canonical splice junction detection. The proposed model is consistent in its performance even with reduced dataset and class-imbalanced dataset. SpliceVec is computationally efficient and can be trained with user-defined data as well.",

     "abstract": "Antifreeze proteins are a class of biological molecules of interest in many research and industrial applications due to their highly specialized function, but there is little information of their stability and properties under varied pH derived from computational studies. To gain novel insights in this area, we conducted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the antifreeze protein 1KDF at varied temperatures and pH. Water solvation and H-bond formation around specific residues – ASN14, THR18 and GLN44 – involved in its antifreeze activity were extensively studied. We found that at pH1 there was a disruption in water solvation around the basal and the ice binding surfaces of the molecule. This was induced by a small change in the secondary structure propensities of some titrable residues, particularly GLU35. This change explains the experimentally observed reduction in antifreeze activity previously reported for this protein at pH1. We also found that THR18 showed extremely low H-bond formation, and that the three antifreeze residues all had very low average H-bond lifetimes. Our results confirm long-standing assumptions that these small, compact molecules can maintain their antifreeze activity in a wide range of pH, while demonstrating the mechanism that may reduce antifreeze activity at low pH. This aspect is useful when considering industrial and commercial use of antifreeze proteins subject to extreme pH environments, in particular in food industrial applications.",

Intriguingly, several isoforms of Mx have been reported in fish, but the structural analysis of fish Mx proteins remains unexplored. For the first time, we have identified and unraveled the molecular structure of Mx protein from Indian snow trout, Schizothorax richardsonii (Gray) a Coldwater fish that inhabits the water bodies in the sub-Himalayan region. The snow trout Mx coding region consists of 2518 nucleotides with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1854 nucleotides. It codes for a polypeptide of 617 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 70 kDa. In silico analysis of snow trout Mx protein revealed signature of dynamin family (LPRGTGIVTR) along with a tripartite GTP-binding domain (GDQSSGKS, DLPG, and TKPD). Homology modelling established that the Mx protein is an elongated structure with a G domain, bundle signaling element (BSE) and a GTPase effector domain (GED). Moreover, the GED of Mx contains two highly conserved leucine zippers at the COOH-terminal of the protein suggesting its structural similarity with human homologues. However, snow trout Mx lacks the essential features of its mammalian homologues questioning its functional characteristics. Further, a ligand binding site in the said protein has also been predicted adjacent to the GTPase switch within the G domain.",

The three dimensional homology models of laccase protein from C. neoformans and other pathogenic gut bacteria were docked with selected biomolecules like prostaglandins (PG), membrane phospholipids, neurotransmitters (serotonin) using GOLD software. The GOLDscore values of laccase from C. neoformans docked with prostaglandinH2 (59.76), prostaglandinG2 (59.45), prostaglandinE2 (60.99), phosphatidylinositol (54.95), phosphatidylcholine (46.26), phosphatidylserine (55.26), arachidonic acid (53.08) and serotonin (46.22) were similar to the laccase from enteropathogenic bacteria but showed a better binding affinity as compared to that of the non-pathogenic bacteria (e.g. Bacillus safensis, Bacillus pumilus and Bacillus subtilis).

This is determined by its degree of affinity for its intrinsic ligand (ICAM) at the active site and accompanying synergistic coordination at the α7 helix. This potentiates the role of inhibitors in disrupting this interaction allosterically. Herein, we present a first account of the structural dynamics which characterizes the inhibitory effect of a novel LFA-1 antagonist, Lifitegrast (SAR1118), upon binding to the I-domain allosteric site (IDAS) using molecular dynamics simulation. Findings from this study revealed that the inhibitor stabilized the closed conformation and reversed the open conformation to a low ICAM-affinity state (closed) as evidenced by the upward movement of the α7 helix and corresponding transitions at the active site. This in both cases favors the formation of the non-disease inactive form. Upon allosteric modulation, the inhibitor significantly restored protein stability, enhanced compactness and decreased residual fluctuation as crucial to its potency in the amelioration of immunological and inflammatory diseases which agrees with experimental studies. These findings could therefore serve as the basis for the exploration of the allosteric domain and its active site affinity modulation to aid the design of more specific and selective inhibitors.",

However, to properly work with high-dimensional data sets, PCA poses severe mathematical constraints on the minimum number of different replicates, or samples, that must be included in the analysis. Generally, improper sampling is due to a small number of data respect to the number of the degrees of freedom that characterize the ensemble. In the field of life sciences it is often important to have an algorithm that can accept poorly dimensioned data sets, including degenerated ones. Here a new random projection algorithm is proposed, in which a random symmetric matrix surrogates the covariance/correlation matrix of PCA, while maintaining the data clustering capacity. We demonstrate that what is important for clustering efficiency of PCA is not the exact form of the covariance/correlation matrix, but simply its symmetry.",

     "abstract": "Computing conformations which are essential to associate structural and functional information with gene sequences, is challenging due to the high dimensionality and rugged energy surface of the protein conformational space. Consequently, the dimension of the protein conformational space should be reduced to a proper level, and an effective exploring algorithm should be proposed. In this paper, a plug-in method for guiding exploration in conformational feature space with Lipschitz underestimation (LUE) for ab-initio protein structure prediction is proposed. The conformational space is converted into ultrafast shape recognition (USR) feature space firstly. Based on the USR feature space, the conformational space can be further converted into Underestimation space according to Lipschitz estimation theory for guiding exploration. As a consequence of the use of underestimation model, the tight lower bound estimate information can be used for exploration guidance, the invalid sampling areas can be eliminated in advance, and the number of energy function evaluations can be reduced. The proposed method provides a novel technique to solve the exploring problem of protein conformational space. LUE is applied to differential evolution (DE) algorithm, and metropolis Monte Carlo(MMC) algorithm which is available in the Rosetta; When LUE is applied to DE and MMC, it will be screened by the underestimation method prior to energy calculation and selection. Further, LUE is compared with DE and MMC by testing on 15 small-to-medium structurally diverse proteins. Test results show that near-native protein structures with higher accuracy can be obtained more rapidly and efficiently with the use of LUE.",

Although numerous computational methods have been developed over the years, a gold standard technique has not been established. Computational ligand docking and structure-based drug design allow researchers to predict the binding affinity between a compound and a target protein, and thus, they are often used to virtually screen compound libraries. In addition, docking techniques have also been applied to the virtual screening of target proteins (inverse docking) to predict target proteins of a drug candidate. Nevertheless, a more accurate docking method is currently required. In this study, we proposed a method in which a predicted ligand-binding site is covered by multiple grids, termed multiple grid arrangement. Notably, multiple grid arrangement facilitates the conformational search for a grid-based ligand docking software and can be applied to the state-of-the-art commercial docking software Glide (Schrödinger, LLC). We validated the proposed method by re-docking with the Astex diverse benchmark dataset and blind binding site situations, which improved the correct prediction rate of the top scoring docking pose from 27.1% to 34.1%; however, only a slight improvement in target prediction accuracy was observed with inverse docking scenarios. These findings highlight the limitations and challenges of current scoring functions and the need for more accurate docking methods. The proposed multiple grid arrangement method was implemented in Glide by modifying a cross-docking script for Glide, xglide.py.

This study compares various Markovian encoding models for splice site prediction utilizing support vector machine, as the most outstanding learning method in the domain, and conducts a new precise evaluation of Markovian approaches that corrects this limitation.

In this paper, a novel feature selection method based on a global search (by using the main concepts of divide and conquer technique) which is called CCFS, is proposed. The proposed CCFS algorithm divides vertically (on features) the dataset by random manner and utilizes the fundamental concepts of cooperation coevolution by using a filter criterion in the fitness function in order to search the solution space via binary gravitational search algorithm. For determining the effectiveness of the proposed method some experiments are carried out on seven binary microarray high dimensional datasets. The obtained results are compared with nine state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms including Interact (INT), and Maximum Relevancy Minimum Redundancy (MRMR). The average outcomes of the results are analyzed by a statistical non-parametric test and it reveals that the proposed method has a meaningful difference to the others in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and number of selected features.",

In our research, with the aid of the ‘Receptor-Ligand Pharmacophore’ technique, a 3D-QSAR method was carried out to explore structure activity relationship of SHP2 allosteric inhibitors. Structure-based drug design was employed to optimize SHP099, an efficacious, potent, and selective SHP2 allosteric inhibitor. A novel class of selective SHP2 allosteric inhibitors was discovered by using the powerful ‘SBP’, ‘ADMET’ and ‘CDOCKER’ techniques. By means of molecular dynamics simulations, it was observed that these novel inhibitors not only had the same function as SHP099 did in inhibiting SHP2, but also had more favorable conformation for binding to the receptor. Thus, this report may provide a new method in discovering novel and selective SHP2 allosteric inhibitors.",

The organism is a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that can cause serious diseases not only in humans but also in animals, such as various skin infections, pneumonia, endocarditis and toxin shock syndrome.

This organism had developed the multidrug resistance by acquiring MEC-A gene. This account for made organism to come into the category of Superbug. Several studies showed that, the toxin production is induced by AIP and RAP via the phosphorylation of TRAP. TRAP is a 21 kDa protein and was believed to be associated with the membrane via SvrA Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that TRAP is histidine phosphorylated in a signal transduction pathway that is activated by RAP. The inhibition of TRAP could be done by RIP (RNAIII-inhibiting peptide). The structure for RIP is still undiscovered to be used as inhibitor.Present work has been carried out to get the structural insight with various online and offline homology modeling techniques such as SWISS-MODEL, MODBASE, GENO3D, CPHmodels and I-TASSER for getting unknown structural information target of RNAIII-activating protein from Staphylococcus aureus strain MRSA252 origin for their future exploration as a target in drug discovery process against MRSA.",

Dynamics simulations revealed that the epitope peptide Rfe (net charge = −1) cannot effectively interact with and permeabilize bacterial membrane due to the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged peptide and anionic membrane surface. The native Rfe can be modified to a cationic peptide Rfe-KKK (net charge = +6) by triple mutation of its positively charged residues Glu256, Asp263 and Asp269 to a basic lysine as well as by C-terminal amidation.

Even though all the strains of Human Papilloma Virus can cause cancer, the high-risk strains can cause severe cancer in a human. The E6 and E7 protein are responsible for the carcinogenic property of HPV. Among these two proteins, the HPV E7 protein plays a major role in the viral life cycle by allowing the virus to replicate in differentiating epithelial cells. All the strains of HPV are variants (High risk and low risk). A computational analysis study is done to find which low-risk strain is showing most similarity with the high risk there by predicting that this low-risk strain can be converted to high-risk if a mutation occurs in future. Through mutation, a normal strain will get converted to low-risk and a low-risk to high-risk. So the mutations are important and it can affect the viruses to a greater extent because of their smaller size. In order to inhibit the expression of Type 11 low-risk strain a noval suppressor molecule is synthesized and characterized using UV, FTIR and NMR spectrometry. The suppressor molecule is a quinazoline derivative, as it can act as an anti-cancer agent to inhibit the expression of the E7 protein in Type 11 strain. The efficiency of binding of type 11 E7 protein with quinazoline derivative is calculated through docking studies using G-Score (Schrodinger). Thus proposing this noval suppressor molecule can be lead against cervical cancer caused by HPV Type 11 strain after further in-vitro and in vivo characterization.",

A series of thiazole-2-yl benzamide derivatives were synthesized from benzoic acid and evaluated by in vitro enzymatic assay for GK activation. In silico docking studies were carried out to determine the binding interactions for the best fit conformations in the allosteric site of GK enzyme. Based on the results of in vitro enzyme assay and in silico studies, the selected molecules were tested for their antidiabetic activity in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The results of the in vitro enzymatic assay were found to be in accordance to that of in silico studies.

Haplotypes, as a set of genetic variations in each chromosome, contain vital information such as the relationship between human genome and diseases. Finding haplotypes in diploid organisms is a challenging task. Experimental methods are expensive and require special equipment. In SIH problem, we encounter with several fragments and each fragment covers some parts of desired haplotype. The main goal is bi-partitioning of the fragments with minimum error correction (MEC). This problem is addressed as NP-hard and several attempts have been made in order to solve it using heuristic methods. The current method, AROHap, has two main phases. In the first phase, most of the fragments are clustered based on a practical metric distance. In the second phase, ARO algorithm as a fast convergence bio-inspired method is used to improve the initial bi-partitioning of the fragments in the previous step. AROHap is implemented with several benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that satisfactory results were obtained, proving that AROHap can be used for SIH reconstruction problem.",

     "abstract": "Previous joint experimental and theoretical work demonstrates that typically soluble peptides will be rendered insoluble in the presence of saturated sodium ions in aqueous solution due to disruption of cation-π interactions between Trp and Lys. The present work utilizes quantum chemical methods including density functional theory, symmetry-adapted perturbation theory, and even coupled cluster theory to determine the strengths of cation-π interactions for the aromatic R groups of Trp, Tyr, and Phe (approximated as skatole, methyl phenol, and toluene) with both alkali and alkaline-Earth atomic cations and electron-accepting R groups from Lys, Arg, and His approximated as methyl ammonium, guanidinium, and imidazolium cations. This work shows that sodium ion is still the most likely disrupter of peptide folding built upon cation-π interactions, since Trp, Tyr, and Phe all bind more strongly to sodium ion than to any of the polyatomic cations. Additionally, the atomic cation complex binding energies decrease with an increase in partial charge on the atomic cation in the complex. However, as the average partial charge increases in the interacting hydrogen atoms in the polyatomic cations, the binding energy increases. The disruption of such peptide–peptide cation-π interactions is certainly relevant for peptide design in β-sheets or β-hairpin structures, but it could also have implications for astrobiology.",

Meanwhile, the icosahedral shell structure of the mature ZIKV was recently revealed by cryo-electron microscopy. This structural information enabled us to simulate ZIKV. In this study, we analyzed the dynamic properties of ZIKV through simulation from the mechanical viewpoint. We performed normal mode analysis (NMA) for a dimeric structure of ZIKV consisting of the envelope proteins and the membrane proteins as a unit structure. By analyzing low-frequency normal modes, we captured intrinsic vibrational motions and defined basic vibrational properties of the unit structure. Moreover, we also simulated the entire shell structure of ZIKV at the reduced computational cost, similar to the case of the unit structure, by utilizing its icosahedral symmetry. From the NMA results, we can not only comprehend the putative dynamic fluctuations of ZIKV but also verify previous inference such that highly mobile glycosylation sites would play an important role in ZIKV. Consequently, this theoretical study is expected to give us an insight on the underlying biological functions and infection mechanism of ZIKV.",

Here, we present a NFκB pathway analysis in tumor specimens of GBM compared to non-neoplasic brain tissues, based on the different kind of cycles found among genes of a gene co-expression network constructed using quantized data obtained from the microarrays. A cycle is a closed walk with all vertices distinct (except the first and last). Thanks to this way of finding relations among genes, a more robust interpretation of gene correlations is possible, because the cycles are associated with feedback mechanisms that are very common in biological networks. In GBM samples, we could conclude that the stoichiometric relationship between genes involved in NFκB pathway regulation is unbalanced. This can be measured and explained by the identification of a cycle. This conclusion helps to understand more about the biology of this type of tumor.",

A deep embedding framework is used to obtain epigenetic signatures from pathways which are then aligned for functional consistency and local topological similarity.Experiments on four benchmark cancer datasets reveal epigenetic signatures that are conserved in cancer-specific and across-cancer subtypes.The proposed deep embedding framework obtains highly coherent signatures that are aligned for biological as well as structural orthology. Comparison with state-of-the-art network alignment methods clearly suggest that the proposed method obtains topologically and functionally more consistent alignments.http://bdbl.nitc.ac.in/DEEPAligner",

     "abstract": "In this study, a virtual screening procedure was applied to identify new potential nt-MGAM inhibitors as a possible medication for type 2 diabetes. To this aim, a series of salacinol analogues were first investigated by docking analysis for their binding to the X-ray structure of the biological target nt-MGAM. Key interactions for ligand binding into the receptor active site were identified which shared common features to those found for other known inhibitors, which strengthen the results of this study. 3D QSAR model was then built and showed to be statistically significant and with a good predictive power for the training (R2 = 0.99, SD = 0.17, F = 555.3 and N = 27) and test set (Q2 = 0.81, Pearson(r) = 0.92, RMSE = 0.52, N = 08). The model was then used to virtually screen the ZINC database with the aim of identifying novel chemical scaffolds as potential nt-MGAM inhibitors. Further, in silico predicted ADME properties were investigated for the most promising molecules. The outcome of this investigation sheds light on the molecular characteristics of the binding of salacinol analogues to nt-MGAM enzyme and identifies new possible inhibitors which have the potential to be developed into drugs, thus significantly contributing to the design and optimization of therapeutic strategies against type 2 diabetes.",

The diversity of the three data sets was done by comparison of the three most important principal components computed from standard molecular descriptors. This was also done by a study of the most common substructures (MCSS keys). Meanwhile, the in silico toxicity predictions were done through the identification of chemical structural alerts using Lhasa's knowledge based Derek system. The results show that the libraries occupy different chemical space and that only an insignificant part of the respective libraries could exhibit toxicities beyond acceptable limits. The predicted toxicities end points for compounds which were predicted to “plausible” were further discussed in the light of available experimental data in the literature. Toxicity predictions are in agreement when using a machine learning approach that employs graph-based structural signatures. The current study sheds further light towards the use of the studied chemical libraries for virtual screening purposes.",

Considering the diversity of antigen among different EG95 isolates, it seems to be an ideal antigen for designing a universal multivalent minigene vaccine, so-called multi-epitope vaccine. This is the first in silico study to design a construct for the development of global EG95-based hydatid vaccine against E. granulosus in intermediate hosts. After antigen sequence selection, the three-dimensional structure of EG95 was modeled and multilaterally validated. The preliminary parameters for B-cell epitope prediction were implemented such as the possible transmembrane helix, signal peptide, post-translational modifications and allergenicity. The high ranked linear and conformational B-cell epitopes derived from several online web-servers (e.g., ElliPro, BepiPred v1.0, BcePred, ABCpred, SVMTrip, IEDB algorithms, SEPPA v2.0 and Discotope v2.0) were utilized for multiple sequence alignment and then for engineering the vaccine construct. T-helper based epitopes were predicted by molecular docking between the high frequent ovar class II allele (Ovar-DRB1*1202) and hexadecamer fragments of the EG95 protein. Having used the immune-informatics tools, we formulated the first EG95-based minigene vaccine based on T-helper epitope with high-binding affinity to the ovar MHC allele. This designed construct was analyzed for different physicochemical properties. It was also codon-optimized for high-level expression in Escherichia coli k12. Taken all, we propose the present in silico vaccine constructs as a promising platform for the generation of broadly protective vaccines for species and genus-specific immunization of the natural hosts of the parasite.",

The kinase has an unstructured C-terminal tail that can be recognized and bound by the PDZ5 domain of its cognate partner, the multi-PDZ domain protein (MUP). In the current study, we reported a rational biomolecular design of halogen-bonding system at the complex interface of CAMK’s C-terminal peptide with MUP PDZ5 domain by using high-level computational approaches. Four organic halogens were employed as atom probes to explore the structural geometry and energetic property of designed halogen bonds in the PDZ5–peptide complex. It was found that the heavier halogen elements such as bromine Br and iodine I can confer stronger halogen bond but would cause bad atomic contacts and overlaps at the complex interface, while fluorine F cannot form effective halogen bond in the complex. In addition, the halogen substitution at different positions of peptide’s aromatic ring would result in distinct effects on the halogen-bonding system. The computational findings were then verified by using fluorescence analysis; it is indicated that the halogen type and substitution position play critical role in the interaction strength of halogen bonds, and thus the PDZ5–peptide binding affinity can be improved considerably by optimizing their combination.",

The main target of potential vaccines that are recently undergoing clinical trials is trimeric glycoprotein (GP) of the EBOV and its exact crystal structure was used in this structure based virtual screening study, with the aid of consensus scoring to select three possible hit compounds from about 36 million compounds in MCULE’s database. Amongst these three compounds, (5R)-5-[[5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl]methyl]-N-[(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl]-4,5-dihydroisoxazole-3-carboxamide (SC-2, C21H19ClN4O4) showed good features with respect to drug likeness, ligand efficiency metrics, solubility, absorption and distribution properties and non-carcinogenicity to emerge as the most promising compound that can be optimized to lead compound against the GP EBOV. The binding mode showed that SC-2 is well embedded within the trimeric chains of the GP EBOV with molecular interactions with some amino acids. The SC-2 hit compound, upon its optimization to lead, might be a good potential candidate with efficacy against the EBOV pathogen and subsequently receive necessary approval to be used as antiviral drug for the treatment of EVD.",

     "abstract": "Plant secondary metabolites are widely used in human disease treatment; though primary metabolism provides precursors for secondary metabolism, not much has been studied to unravel the link connecting both the processes. Most common form of gene regulation interconnecting diverse metabolism occurs at the transcriptional and/or posttranscriptional level mediated by regulatory cis-elements. The present study aims at understanding the common cis-elements network connecting the major primary metabolic enzyme, cell wall invertase (CWIN) and secondary metabolism genes in Nicotiana benthamiana (N. benthamiana). The CWIN and thirty one other gene sequences were extracted from N. benthamiana genome, followed by cis-element analysis of their 5′ upstream and 3′ downstream region using different programs (Genomatix software suite; PLACE and PlantCARe). Comparative cis-element analysis of CWIN (N. benthamiana and other plant species) and other primary, secondary metabolism and transcription factor genes (N. benthamiana) revealed the occurrence of common stress associated cis-elements. Predominantly, AHBP, L1BX, MYBL, MADS, MYBS, GTBX, DOFF and CCAF were found in the 5′ upstream region of all genes, whereas AHBP, MYBL, L1BX, HEAT, CCAF and KAN1 were largely occurring in the 3′ downstream region of all genes; indicating common function of these elements in transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene regulation. Further, genomic analysis using FGENESH, GenScan and homology based methods (BlastX and BlastN) was performed on the N. benthamiana contigs harboring CWIN and PAL, in an attempt to identify genomic neighborhood genes. The 5′ upstream and 3′ downstream region of genes in the genomic neighborhood of CWIN and PAL were also subjected to similar cis-element analysis, and the results indicated cis-elements profile similar to CWIN, PAL and other primary, secondary metabolism and transcription factor genes. The results of evolutionary studies confirmed that the 5′ upstream region of NbCWINs significantly showed more proximity to secondary metabolism genes 4CL and the redox gene SOD, followed by the phenylpropanoid pathway gene CHI. The 3′ downstream regions of NbCWINs were more closely related to other plant CWINs, followed by the redox gene, SOD and primary metabolism gene FBA. Thus, the commonly found stress responsive cis-elements in our study can play a vital role in modulating key pathways of both primary and secondary metabolism; thereby postulating their role in regulating plant growth and metabolisms under unfavourable growth conditions.",

     "abstract": "Due to multifactorial nature of Alzheimer’s disease one target-one ligand hypothesis often looks insufficient. BACE-1 and GSK-3β are well established therapeutic drug targets and interaction between BACE-1 and GSK-3β pathways has also been established. Thus, designing of dual inhibitor for these two targets seems rational and may provide effective therapeutic strategies against AD. Recent studies revealed that only two scaffolds i.e. triazinone and curcumin act as a dual inhibitor against BACE-1 and GSK-3β. Thus, this discovery set the path to screen new chemical entities from a vast chemical space (∼1060 compounds) that inhibit both the targets. However, small part of the large chemical space will only show biological activity for specific targets. Virtual screening of large libraries is impractical and computational expensive especially in case of dual inhibitor design. In the case of dual or multi target inhibitor designing, we screened the database for each target that further increases time and resources. In this study we have done physicochemical descriptor based profiling to know the biological relevant chemical space for BACE-1 and GSK-3β inhibitors and proposed the suitable range of important physicochemical properties, occurrence of functional groups. We generated scaffolds tree of known inhibitors of BACE-1 and GSK-3β suggesting the common structure/fragment that can be used to design dual inhibitors. This approach can filter the potential dual inhibitor candidates of BACE-1 and GSK-3β from non inhibitors.",

In the absence of x-ray crystal structure of this enzyme, homology modeling proved to be a reasonable alternate to study substrate binding mechanisms of this enzyme. In this study, a 3-D homology model for P. falciparum IMPDH was constructed taking human IMPDH (PDB code 1NF7) as template. Furthermore, an in-silico combinatorial library of ribavirin (RVP) derivatives (1347 molecules) was designed and virtually screened for ligands having selectively greater binding affinity with Plasmodium falciparum IMPDH relative to human IMPDH II. A total of five Ribavirin derivatives were identified as having greater binding affinity (−126 to −108 Kcal/mol and −9.4 to −8.6 Kcal/mol) with Plasmodium falciparum IMPDH. These five inhibitors should be used as selective and potent for Plasmodium falciparum IMPDH.

We isolated and sequenced 15 rbcL and six matK fragments, but our analysis of the resultant sequences demonstrated a limited ability of matK and rbcL in distinguishing between Triticum accessions. Therefore, we pursued a bioinformatics approach to determine the most useful loci which may be used as DNA barcodes for the Triticum spp. We obtained the 10 available chloroplast genomes of the 10 Triticum species and sub-species from NCBI, and performed chloroplast genome-wide analysis to find the potential barcode loci. A total of 134 chloroplast genes, gene combinations, intergenic regions and intergenic region combinations were tested using a Tree-based method. We were unable to discriminate between Triticum species by using chloroplast genes, gene combinations and intergenic regions. However, a combination of the intergenic region (trnfM-trnT) with either (trnD-psbM), (petN-trnC), (matK-rps16) or (rbcL-psaI) demonstrated a very high discrimination capacity, suggesting their utilization as DNA barcodes for the Triticum plants.

BnAP2/ERF TFs were classified into five major subfamilies, including DREB, ERF, AP2, RAV, and BnSoloist. This classification is based on phylogenetic analysis, motif identification, gene structure analysis, and physiochemical characterization. These TFs were annotated based on phylogenetic relationship with Brassica rapa. BnAP2/ERF TFs were located on 19 chromosomes of B. napus. Orthologs and paralogs were identified using synteny-based methods Ks calculation within B. napus genome and between B. napus with other species such as B. rapa, Brassica oleracea, and Arabidopsis thaliana indicated that BnAP2/ERF TFs were formed through duplication events occurred before B. napus formation. Kn/Ks values were between 0 and 1, suggesting the purifying selection among BnAP2/ERF TFs. Gene ontology annotation, cis-regulatory elements and functional interaction networks suggested that BnAP2/ERF TFs participate in response to stressors, including drought, high salinity, heat and cold as well as developmental processes particularly organ specification and embryogenesis. The identified cis-regulatory elements in the upstream of BnAP2/ERF TFs were responsive to abscisic acid. Analysis of the expression data derived from Illumina Hiseq 2000 RNA sequencing revealed that BnAP2/ERF genes were highly expressed in the roots comparing to flower buds, leaves, and stems. Also, the ERF subfamily was over-expressed under salt and fungal treatments. BnERF039 and BnERF245 are candidates for salt-tolerant B. napus. BnERF253-256 and BnERF260-277 are potential cytokinin response factors. BnERF227, BnERF228, BnERF234, BnERF134, BnERF132, BnERF176, and BnERF235 were suggested for resistance against Leptosphaeria maculan and Leptosphaeria biglobosa.",

The data obtained were integrated with in silico prediction of potential metabolites of DA-Phen using the SmartCYP predictive tool.DA-Phen reached quantitatively the Central Nervous System and the results showed that the amide bond of the DA-Phen is scarcely hydrolysed as it was found intact in analyzed organs. As a consequence, it is possible to assume that DA-Phen acts as dopaminergic modulator per se and not as a Dopamine prodrug, thus avoiding peripheral release and toxic side effects due to the endogenous neurotransmitter.Furthermore the identification of potential metabolites related to biotransformation of the drug candidate leads to a more careful evaluation of the appropriate route of administration for future intended therapeutic aims and potential translation into clinical studies.",

We utilized high-throughput virtual screening to find which natural compounds could bind to the zinc-binding site.

The results showed that Celacinnine, Lobelanidine and Celallocinnine were qualified to interact with zinc-binding site and displayed well predictive activity. We found that celallocinnine was the best TCM compound for zinc binging sites of MMP-9 because the stable interactions were observed under dynamic condition. In addition, Celacinnine and Lobelanidine could interact with MMP-9 related protein that identified by drug-target interaction network analysis. Thus, we suggested the herbs Hypericum patulum, Sedum acre, and Tripterygium wilfordii that containing Celallocinnine, Celacinnine and Lobelanidine might be a novel medicine formula to avoid the side effect of tetracycline and increase the efficacy of treatment.",

Based on free energy values comparison and frontier molecular orbital analysis, we have obtained the most stable structures in each protonation state. CHD in saturated form has HOMO localized in one p-chloroaniline, and, due to molecule’s symmetry, HOMO-1 has contributions from the other side of the molecule, but mainly from the biguanide portion of the molecule, instead of from the p-chloroaniline. For the saturated form, we have studied two possible degradation pathways, starting from the monoprotonated structure, and three pathways starting from the neutral structure.

Chromene-based compounds have been proven to be the novel anti-MDR agents for inhibiting proliferation of tumor cells through tubulin polymerization inhibition of by binding at the colchicine binding site. In this study, we screened a chromene-based database of small molecules using physicochemical, ADMET properties and molecular docking to identify potential hit compounds. In order to validate our hit compounds, molecular dynamics simulations and related analysis were carried out and the results suggest that our hit compounds (PubChem CIDs: 16814409, 17594471, 57367244 and 69899719) can prove to be potential inhibitors of tubulin. The in silico results show that the present hits, like colchicine, effectively suppressed the dynamic instability of microtubules and induced microtubule-depolymerization and cell cycle arrest.",

The accurate identification of glycation sites is important to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of glycation. As the traditional experimental methods are often labor-intensive and time-consuming, it is desired to develop computational methods to predict glycation sites. In this study, a novel predictor named BPB_GlySite is proposed to predict lysine glycation sites by using bi-profile bayes feature extraction and support vector machine algorithm. As illustrated by 10-fold cross-validation, BPB_GlySite achieves a satisfactory performance with a Sensitivity of 63.68%, a Specificity of 72.60%, an Accuracy of 69.63% and a Matthew’s correlation coefficient of 0.3499. Experimental results also indicate that BPB_GlySite significantly outperforms three existing glycation sites predictors: NetGlycate, PreGly and Gly-PseAAC. Therefore, BPB_GlySite can be a useful bioinformatics tool for the prediction of glycation sites. A user-friendly web-server for BPB_GlySite is established at 123.206.31.171/BPB_GlySite/.",

In this study, we have performed pharmacophore modeling and 3D QSAR studies on a series of 36 indoles and 7-azoindoles derivatives as ROCK2 inhibitors to elucidate the structural variations with their inhibitory activities. Ligand based CoMFA and CoMSIA models were generated based on three different alignment methods such as systematic search, simulated annealing and pharmacophore.

Contour maps of the selected models were compared, analysed and reported. The 3D QSAR study revealed that electro positive group linked to the methoxy-benzene ring position of the structure will enhance the biological activity and bulkier substitutions are preferred in the methyl dihydroindole region.

The compounds are all non-sterid that have been reported as pharmacologically active molecular entities potential for EM therapeutics, while the kinases were curated via gene ontology terms enriched from the gene co-citation network with EM. The resulting profile was analyzed at structural, energetic and dynamic levels to identify druggable kinase–compound interactions. The compounds Gossypol, Curcumin and EGCG showed a similar interaction profile across these kinases; they can bind tightly to the top-listed kinases in gene ontology, while the compounds Marrubiin, Apigenin and DIM were predicted to exhibit generally weak affinity for the 20 curated kinases. The JNK kinase, a MAPK family member, was identified as a putative candidate of druggable target for EM therapeutics; the inhibitory activity of eight naturally occurring compounds as well as a sophisticated kinase inhibitor SP600125 against the JNK was tested using enzymatic activity analysis. As might be expected, the Gossypol and EGCG were determined to have high inhibitory activity at namomolar level (IC50 = 55 and 94 nM, respectively), which are comparable with or better than the positive control SP600125 (IC50 = 76 nM), while other tested compounds exhibited weak inhibition (IC50 > 100 nM) or bad potency (IC50 = n.d.) against the kinase.",

The envelope protein of DENV is responsible for mediating the fusion process between viral and host membranes. This work reports an in silico approach to target B and T cell epitopes for dengue envelope protein inhibition. A conserved region “QHGTI” in B and T cell epitopes of dengue envelope glycoprotein was confirmed to be valid for targeting by visualizing its interactions with the host cell membrane TIM-1 protein which acts as a receptor for serotype 2 and 3. A reverse pharmacophore mapping approach was used to generate a seven featured pharmacophore model on the basis of predicted epitope. This pharmacophore model as a 3D query was used to virtually screen a chemical compounds dataset “Chembridge”. A total of 1010 compounds mapped on the developed pharmacophore model. These retrieved hits were subjected to filtering via Lipinski’s rule of five, as a result 442 molecules were shortlisted for further assessment using molecular docking. Finally, 14 hits of different structural properties having interactions with the active site residues of dengue envelope glycoprotein were selected as lead candidates. These structurally diverse lead candidates have strong likelihood to act as further starting structures in the development of novel and potential drugs for the treatment of dengue fever.",

This hybrid search technique is facilitated by evaluating the performance of ICA + ABC on six standard gene expression datasets of classification.

Instead, most or even all genes are invited into differential calls no matter they have real contributions to data variations or not. Thus, it would inevitably affect the robustness of D.E. analysis and lead to the increase of false positive ratios.In this study, we presented a novel feature selection method: nonnegative singular value approximation (NSVA) to enhance RNA-seq differential expression analysis by taking advantage of RNA-seq count data's non-negativity. As a variance-based feature selection method, it selects genes according to its contribution to the first singular value direction of input data in a data-driven approach. It demonstrates robustness to depth bias and gene length bias in feature selection in comparison with its five peer methods. Combining with state-of-the-art RNA-seq differential expression analysis, it contributes to enhancing differential expression analysis by lowering false discovery rates caused by the biases.

Then, it tailors a graph hashing method to explore the underlying structure between GO terms and to obtain a series of hash functions to compress the high-dimensional protein-term association matrix into a low-dimensional one. Next, HashGO computes the semantic similarity between proteins based on Hamming distance on that low-dimensional matrix. After that, it predicts missing annotations of a protein based on the annotations of its semantic neighbors. Experimental results on archived GO annotations of two model species (Yeast and Human) show that HashGO not only more accurately predicts functions than other related approaches, but also runs faster than them.",

Special attention should be paid to this virus since there is no approved treatment for it. On the other hand, the recent outbreak of Ebola virus which is a member of hemorrhagic fever viruses shows this group of viruses can be extremely dangerous. Previous studies have indicated that nucleoprotein of CCHFV, a pivotal protein in virus replication, is an appropriate target for antiviral drug development. The aim of this study is finding inhibitor(s) of this protein. Herein, a virtual screening procedure employing docking followed by molecular dynamic was used to identify small molecule inhibitors of the nucleoprotein from FDA-approved drugs. Regarding CCHFV, using in-silico method is a safe way to achieve its inhibitor(s) since this virus is categorized as a World Health Organization (WHO) biosafety level 4 pathogen and therefore investigation in general laboratories is restricted. In conclusion, considering docking and molecular dynamic results alongside with bioavailability of FDA-approved drugs, doxycycline and minocycline are proposed as potential inhibitors of CCHFV nucleoprotein. There is hope, this study encourage other research groups for in-vitro and in-vivo studies about the efficacy of those two medicines in CCHFV treatment.",

In the present in silico study, the protein domains of fifteen pollen sequences were extracted from the UniProt database and submitted to the interactive web tool SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool), for finding the protein domain profiles.

Based on the shared motifs in proteins of taxonomicall-ydispersed organisms, it can be hypothesized that allergens and pathogens manipulate the human immune system in a similar manner. Allergens, being inanimate, cannot replicate in human body, and are neutralized by immune system. But, when the allergens are unremitting, the immune system becomes persistently hyper-sensitized, creating an inflammatory milieu.

By integrating pineapple genome and proteome data, twenty-one putative terpene synthase genes were found in pineapple and divided into five subfamilies.

Cancer is well established as a multifactorial disease and requires multi-module therapeutics. Search for new drugs and their approval by FDA takes a long time. Keeping this in view, research on new functions of FDA-approved anticancer drugs is desired to expand the list of multi-module functioning drugs for cancer therapy. In this study, we conducted an analysis for new functions of 5-Aza-dC by applying bio-chemo-informatics approach. The potential of 5-Aza-dC bioactivity was analyzed by PASS online and Molinspiration. Target proteins were predicted by SuperPred. The protein networks and biological processes were analyzed by Biological Networks using Gene Ontology tool, BINGO, based on BIOGRID database. Interactions between 5-Aza-dC and targeted proteins were examined by Autodoc Vina integrated into pyrx software. Induction of p53 by 5-Aza-dC was tested in vitro using cancer cells. Bioinformatics analyses predicted that 5-Aza-dC functions as a p53 inducer, radiosensitizer, and inhibitor of some enzymes. It was predicted to target proteins including MDM2, POLA1, POLB, and CXCR4 that are involved in the induction of DNA damage response and p53-HDM2-p21 signaling. In this study, we provide experimental evidence showing HDM2 is one of the targets of 5-AZA-dC leading to activation of p53 pathway and growth arrest of cells. Furthermore, we found that the combinatorial treatment of 5-AZA-dC with three other drugs caused drug resistance. We discuss that 5-Aza-dC-induced senescence is a multi-module drug that controls cell proliferation phenotype not only by proteins but also by noncoding miRNAs. Further studies are warranted to dissect these mechanisms and establish 5-Aza-dC as an effective multi-module anticancer reagent.",

Drawing sound inferences from such experiments relies on appropriate mathematical methods to model the distribution of reads along the genome, which has been challenging due to the scale and nature of these data.We propose a new framework (SRSFseq) based on square root slope functions shape analysis to analyse Illumina sequencing data. In the new approach the basic unit of information is the density of mapped reads over region of interest located on the known reference genome. The densities are interpreted as shapes and a new shape analysis model is proposed. An equivalent of a Fisher test is used to quantify the significance of shape differences in read distribution patterns between groups of density functions in different experimental conditions. We evaluated the performance of this new framework to analyze RNA-seq data at the exon level, which enabled the detection of variation in read distributions and abundances between experimental conditions not detected by other methods. Thus, the method is a suitable supplement to the state-of-the-art count based techniques. The variety of density representations and flexibility of mathematical design allow the model to be easily adapted to other data types or problems in which the distribution of reads is to be tested. The functional interpretation and SRSF phase-amplitude separation technique give an efficient noise reduction procedure improving the sensitivity and specificity of the method.",

NADP(H)-dependent 7α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from Clostridium absonum (CA 7α-HSDH), a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily (SDRs), possesses positively charged CSDSs that mainly contain T15, R16, R38, and R194, forming complicated polar interactions with the adenosine ribose C2 phosphate group of NADP(H). The R38 residue is crucial for coenzyme anchoring, but the influence of the other residues on coenzyme utilization is still not clear. Hence, we performed alanine scanning mutagenesis and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The results suggest that the natural CSDSs have the greatest NADP(H)-binding affinity, but not the best activity (kcat) toward NADP+. Compared with the wild type and other mutants, the mutant R194A showed the highest catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), which was more than three-times that of the wild type. MD simulation and kinetics analysis suggested that the importance of the CSDSs of CA 7α-HSDH should be in accordance with the following order R38 > T15 > R16 > R194, and S39 may have a supporting role in NADP(H) anchoring for mutants R16A/T194A and T15A/R16A/T194A.",

The miRNAs play vital roles in multiple biological and metabolic processes, including developmental timing, signal transduction, cell maintenance and differentiation, diseases and cancers. Experimental identification of microRNAs is expensive and lab-intensive. Alternatively, computational approaches for predicting putative miRNAs from genomic or exomic sequences rely on features of miRNAs viz. secondary structures, sequence conservation, minimum free energy index (MFEI) etc. To date, not a single miRNA has been identified in bubaline (Bubalus bubalis), which is an economically important livestock. The present study aims at predicting the putative miRNAs of buffalo using comparative computational approach from buffalo whole genome shotgun sequencing data (INSDC: AWWX00000000.1). The sequences were blasted against the known mammalian miRNA. The obtained miRNAs were then passed through a series of filtration criteria to obtain the set of predicted (putative and novel) bubaline miRNA. Eight miRNAs were selected based on lowest E-value and validated by real time PCR (SYBR green chemistry) using RNU6 as endogenous control. The results from different trails of real time PCR shows that out of selected 8 miRNAs, only 2 (hsa-miR-1277-5p; bta-miR-2285b) are not expressed in bubaline PBMCs. The potential target genes based on their sequence complementarities were then predicted using miRanda.

To better characterize the primary and secondary structure determinants of citrullination specificity, we mined the literature for protein sequences susceptible to citrullination by hPAD2 or hPAD4.

Next, we used motif-x and pLogo to extract and visualize statistically significant motifs within each data set. Within the data sets of peptides predicted to lie in coil regions, both hPAD2 and hPAD4 appear to favor citrullination of glycine-containing motifs, while distinct hydrophobic motifs were identified for hPAD2 citrullination sites predicted to reside within α-helical and β-sheet regions. Additionally, we identified potential substrate overlap between coil region citrullination and arginine methylation.

Hotspot amino acid residues in proteins are the most important contributors for proper protein–protein interactions. Hotspot amino acid residues have been looked down upon as important therapeutic targets in inhibiting PPIs. Interaction between TRAF6 and Ubc13 is a crucial point in the NFkB inflammatory pathway. Dysfunction of the NFkB pathway is associated with numerous human diseases including cancer and neurodenegeration disorders. Ubc13 also interacts specifically to TRAF6 and not with other proteins of the TRAF family and this makes the TRAF6-Ubc13 complex an important target for specific inhibition.

In the present study, we searched the TRAF6-Ubc13 interaction interface to analyze their binding hotspot amino acid residues using various computational techniques. Heterocyclic compounds are known for their medicinal properties. We screened for heterocyclic analogues to the known TRAF6 inhibitor PDTC, to predict a better inhibitor using in silico protein–ligand and protein–protein interaction studies.

However, its catalytic mechanism has not been delineated, and to enhance its efficiency and utility for environmental and industrial applications, knowledge of its catalytic mechanism, which includes identification of its catalytic residues, is required. Using ab initio fragment molecular orbital calculations, molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area calculations, and classical molecular dynamic simulation of a three-dimensional model of DehL-l-2-chloropropionic acid complex, we predicted the catalytic residues of DehL and propose its catalytic mechanism. We found that when Asp13, Thr17, Met48, Arg51, and His184 were individually replaced with an alanine in silico, a significant decrease in the free energy of binding for the DehL-l-2-chloropropionic acid model complex was seen, indicating the involvement of these residues in catalysis and/or structural integrity of the active site. Furthermore, strong inter-fragment interaction energies calculated for Asp13 and L-2-chloropropionic acid, and for a water molecule and His184, and maintenance of the distances between atoms in the aforementioned pairs during the molecular dynamics run suggest that Asp13 acts as the nucleophile and His184 activates the water involved in DehL catalysis. The results of this study should be important for the rational design of a DehL mutant with improved catalytic efficiency.",

There is no licensed therapy for AKU. Many missense mutations have been individuated as responsible for quaternary structure disruption of the native hexameric HGD. A new approach to the treatment of AKU is here proposed aiming to totally or partially rescue enzyme activity by targeting of HGD with pharmacological chaperones, i.e. small molecules helping structural stability. Co-factor pockets from oligomeric proteins have already been successfully exploited as targets for such a strategy, but no similar sites are present at HGD surface; hence, transient pockets are here proposed as a target for pharmacological chaperones. Transient pockets are detected along the molecular dynamics trajectory of the protein and filtered down to a set of suitable sites for structural stabilization by mean of biochemical and pharmacological criteria.

     "abstract": "Predicting the β-sheet structure of a protein is one of the most important intermediate steps towards the identification of its tertiary structure. However, it is regarded as the primary bottleneck due to the presence of non-local interactions between several discontinuous regions in β-sheets. To achieve reliable long-range interactions, a promising approach is to enumerate and rank all β-sheet conformations for a given protein and find the one with the highest score. The problem with this solution is that the search space of the problem grows exponentially with respect to the number of β-strands. Additionally, brute-force calculation in this conformational space leads to dealing with a combinatorial explosion problem with intractable computational complexity. The main contribution of this paper is to generate and search the space of the problem efficiently to reduce the time complexity of the problem. To achieve this, two tree structures, called sheet-tree and grouping-tree, are proposed. They model the search space by breaking it into sub-problems. Then, an advanced dynamic programming is proposed that stores the intermediate results, avoids repetitive calculation by repeatedly uses them efficiently in successive steps and reduces the space of the problem by removing those intermediate results that will no longer be required in later steps. As a consequence, the following contributions have been made. Firstly, more accurate β-sheet structures are found by searching all possible conformations, and secondly, the time complexity of the problem is reduced by searching the space of the problem efficiently which makes the proposed method applicable to predict β-sheet structures with high number of β-strands. Experimental results on the BetaSheet916 dataset showed significant improvements of the proposed method in both execution time and the prediction accuracy in comparison with the state-of-the-art β-sheet structure prediction methods Moreover, we investigate the effect of different contact map predictors on the performance of the proposed method using BetaSheet1452 dataset.

     "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by formation of pro-oxidative lipids in large and medium-sized vessels. Over the years, many treatments and drugs have entered the market to improve atherosclerosis and autoantigen-mediated active immunization is currently considered as a beneficial method. Therefore, this study was conducted to design a novel epitope-based vaccine against atherosclerosis employing CD99, CD81 and CD99L2 antigens. In this way, structural vaccinology approaches were used to design a novel multi-epitope vaccine against atherosclerosis. Six epitopes were predicted from CD99, CD81 and CD99L2 proteins. In addition, helper epitopes selected from Tetanus toxin fragment C (TTFrC)ion were applied to induce CD4+ helper T lymphocytes (HTLs) responses. Moreover, cholera toxin B (CTB) was employed as an adjuvant. Finally, EAAAK AND GPGPG sequences as linkers were considered to make a linkage between favorite peptide sequences. A multi-epitope construction was designed based on the predicted epitopes which was 270 residues in length. Further immunoinformatic analyses were carried out to assess physicochemical properties, secondary and tertiary structures, stability, intrinsic protein disorder, solubility, and allergenicity of this chimeric protein.Based on the obtained results, a soluble, and non-allergic protein with a molecular weight of 28.7 kDa was designed. Further analyses revealed that the chimeric protein is a stable protein and the predicted epitopes indicated strong potential to induce B-cell and T-cell mediated immune response. Our immunoinformatic analyses revealed that the modeled multi-epitope vaccine had appropriate properties,which can properly stimulate the immune responses of both T and B cells.",

     "abstract": "Pelargonidin is an anthocyanidin isolated from plant resources. It shows strong cytotoxicity toward various cancer cell lines, even though the carcinogenesis-modulating pathway of pelargonidin is not yet known. One of our previous reports showed that pelargonidin arrests the cell cycle and induces apoptosis in HT29 cells. Flowcytometry and immunoblot analysis confirmed that pelargonidin specifically inhibits the activation of CDK1 and blocks the G2-M transition of the cell cycle. In addition, DNA fragmentation was observed along with induction of cytochrome c release-mediated apoptosis. Hence, the aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of pelargonidin’s action on cell cycle regulators CDK1, CDK4, and CDK6 as well as the substrate-binding domain of DNMT1 and DNMT3A, which regulate the epigenetic signals related to DNA methylation. The results of docking analysis, binding free energy calculation, and molecular dynamics simulation correlated with the experimental results, and pelargonidin showed a specific interaction with CDK1. In this context, pelargonidin may also inhibit the recognition of DNA and catalytic binding by DNMT1 and DNMT3A. The HOMO-LUMO analysis mapped the functional groups of pelargonidin. Prediction of pharmacological descriptors suggested that pelargonidin can serve as a multitarget inhibitor for cancer treatment.",

     "abstract": "Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the Arabian Gulf region, especially among women. Recent studies show that the vitamin D deficiency is associated with a mineral status of a patient. Therefore, it is important to assess the mineral status of the patient to reveal the hidden mineral imbalance associated with vitamin D deficiency. A well-known test such as the red blood cells is fairly expensive, invasive, and less informative. On the other hand, a hair mineral analysis can be considered an accurate, excellent, highly informative tool to measure mineral imbalance associated with vitamin D deficiency. In this study, 118 apparently healthy Kuwaiti women were assessed for their mineral levels and vitamin D status by a hair mineral analysis (HMA). This information was used to build a computerized model that would predict vitamin D deficiency based on its association with the levels and ratios of minerals. The first phase of the proposed model introduces a novel hybrid optimization algorithm, which can be considered as an improvement of Bat Algorithm (BA) to select the most discriminative features. The improvement includes using the mutation process of Genetic Algorithm (GA) to update the positions of bats with the aim of speeding up convergence; thus, making the algorithm more feasible for wider ranges of real-world applications. Due to the imbalanced class distribution in our dataset, in the second phase, different sampling methods such as Random Under-Sampling, Random Over-Sampling, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique are used to solve the problem of imbalanced datasets. In the third phase, an AdaBoost ensemble classifier is used to predicting the vitamin D deficiency. The results showed that the proposed model achieved good results to detect the deficiency in vitamin D.",

     "abstract": "Proteins are the macromolecules responsible for almost all biological processes in a cell. With the availability of large number of protein sequences from different sequencing projects, the challenge with the scientist is to characterize their functions. As the wet lab methods are time consuming and expensive, many computational methods such as FASTA, PSI-BLAST, DNA microarray clustering, and Nearest Neighborhood classification on protein–protein interaction network have been proposed. Support vector machine is one such method that has been used successfully for several problems such as protein fold recognition, protein structure prediction etc. Cai et al. in 2003 have used SVM for classifying proteins into different functional classes and to predict their function. They used the physico-chemical properties of proteins to represent the protein sequences. In this paper a model comprising of feature subset selection followed by multiclass Support Vector Machine is proposed to determine the functional class of a newly generated protein sequence. To train and test the model for its performance, 32 physico-chemical properties of enzymes from 6 enzyme classes are considered. To determine the features that contribute significantly for functional classification, Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS), Orthogonal Forward Selection (OFS), and SVM Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithms are used and it is observed that out of 32 properties considered initially, only 20 features are sufficient to classify the proteins into its functional classes with an accuracy ranging from 91% to 94%. On comparison it is seen that, OFS followed by SVM performs better than other methods. Our model generalizes the existing model to include multiclass classification and to identify most significant features affecting the protein function.",

Along with the evolutionary role, radioresistant organisms play important role in paper industries, bioremediation, vaccine development and possibility in anti-aging and anti-cancer treatment. The study of radiation resistance in RRB was mainly focused on cytosolic mechanisms such as DNA repair mechanism, cell cleansing activity and high antioxidant activity. Although it was known that protein localized on outer areas of cell play role in resistance towards extreme condition but the mechanisms/proteins localized on the outer area of cells are not studied for radioresistance. Considering the fact that outer part of cell is more exposed to radiations and proteins present in outer area of the cell may have role in radioresistance. Localization based comparative study of proteome from RRB and non-radio resistant bacteria was carried out. In RRB 20 unique proteins have been identified. Further domain, structural, and pathway analysis of selected proteins were carried out. Out of 20 proteins, 8 proteins were direct involvement in radioresistance and literature study strengthens this, however, 1 proteins had assumed relation in radioresistance.

The results demonstrated that 71.5% (103/144) of samples were PTTV positive. The rate of sequence homology among the six PTTV complete genomes obtained from Jiangsu province ranged from 99.7% to 100%. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that PTTV genomes had a high degree of genetic similarity and were similar to chicken anemia virus that also had poultry as a host. Although with the same host, PTTV shared distant relationship with PiCV in both complete genome, Rep and Cap genes. The results of this study provided evidence that PTTV could be detected in Chinese pigeons at a high level, the evolutionary process of complete genome, Rep and Cap genes of Anelloviridae family had obvious divergence.",

Third, we sum over the scores of member proteins to obtain a summary score for each candidate protein complex, and then rank all candidate protein complexes according to their scores.

During the transition phases, between active and inactive states, P-loop and switch regions show maximum variations. Various hot-spot Ras mutants (G12 V, A59G, Q61L etc) have been reported, that limit the protein's conformation in the permanent active state. In the present study, we aim to explore the structural dynamics of one such crucial mutant of Ras namely A59G which belongs to the conserved Switch II region of the protein. Approximately ∼15 μs of Classical Molecular Dynamics (CMD) simulations have been carried out on the mutant and wild-type complexes. Further, a metadynamics simulation of 500 ns was also carried out, which suggests an energy barrier of ∼9.56 kcal/mol between wild-type and mutant conformation. We demonstrate the role of water molecule in maintaining the required interaction networks in the pre-hydrolysis state, its impact on A59G mutation, distinct orientation of the Gln61 residue in two conformations, disruption of crucial Gly60 and γ phosphate and the change in the Switch II region. The outcome of our study captures the pre-hydrolysis state of the HRas protein. It also establishes the fact that this mutation makes the movement of Switch II region and the conserved DXXGQ motif highly constrained, which is known to be an important requirement for hydrolysis. This suggests that the A59G mutation may decrease the rate of intrinsic hydrolysis as well as GAP-mediated hydrolysis.",

     "abstract": "The readily available high throughput screening (HTS) data from the PubChem database provides an opportunity for mining of small molecules in a variety of biological systems using machine learning techniques. From the thousands of available molecular descriptors developed to encode useful chemical information representing the characteristics of molecules, descriptor selection is an essential step in building an optimal quantitative structural-activity relationship (QSAR) model. For the development of a systematic descriptor selection strategy, we need the understanding of the relationship between: (i) the descriptor selection; (ii) the choice of the machine learning model; and (iii) the characteristics of the target bio-molecule. In this work, we employed the Signature descriptor to generate a dataset on the Human kallikrein 5 (hK 5) inhibition confirmatory assay data and compared multiple classification models including logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest and k-nearest neighbor. Under optimal conditions, the logistic regression model provided extremely high overall accuracy (98%) and precision (90%), with good sensitivity (65%) in the cross validation test. In testing the primary HTS screening data with more than 200 K molecular structures, the logistic regression model exhibited the capability of eliminating more than 99.9% of the inactive structures. As part of our exploration of the descriptor-model-target relationship, the excellent predictive performance of the combination of the Signature descriptor and the logistic regression model on the assay data of the Human kallikrein 5 (hK 5) target suggested a feasible descriptor/model selection strategy on similar targets.",

Here, we described a successful computational design of peptide ligands to target the intermolecular interaction between the virus large envelope protein (LHB) and adaptin receptor (ADT). Based on the crystal structure of ADT in complex with an oligopeptide segment corresponding to the core binding site of LHB, a sequence-specific amino acid preference profile was determined systematically for the ADT-binding peptides using structural bioinformatics approach. With the information harvested from the profile, a genetic evolution procedure was run to improve the biological potency of a peptide population generated randomly from the LHB. A number of potential hits were obtained from the evolution, and four were measured to interact with ADT at micromolar level. A high-affinity hit peptide was then optimized according to computational structural analysis. It is revealed that a potent peptide can be divided into three regions, i.e. a negatively charged region at N-terminus, a hydrophobic core region in middle, and a small, polar region at C-terminal tail. In addition, the two termini of peptide are partially out of the active pocket of ADT, thus contributing moderately to the peptide binding.",

Warfarin is an anticoagulant normally used in the prevention of the formation of clots. This research was conducted on 553 patients during 2013–2015 who were candidates for using warfarin and their INR was in the target range. Features affecting dose was implemented and evaluated, which were clinical and genetic characteristics extracted, and new methods of feature selection based on multi-objective optimization methods such as the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) along with the evaluation of artificial neural networks were used. Multi-objective optimization methods have more accuracy and performance compared to the classic methods of feature selection. Furthermore, multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm has higher precision than Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II. With a choice of seven features Mean Square Error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were 0.011, 0.1 and 0.109 for MOPSO, respectively.",

     "abstract": "Radiotherapy (RT) is a common cancer treatment approach that accounts for nearly 50% of patient treatment; however, tumor relapse after radiotherapy is still a major issue. To study the crucial role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the regulation of tumor progression post-RT, microarray experiments comparing TAM gene expression profiles between unirradiated and irradiated tumors were conducted to discover possible roles of TAMs in initiation or contribution to tumor recurrence following RT, taking into account the relationships among gene expression, tumor microenvironment, and immunology. A single dose of 25 Gy was given to TRAMP C-1 prostate tumors established in C57/B6 mice. CD11b-positive macrophages were extracted from the tumors at one, two and three weeks post-RT. Gene ontology (GO) term analysis using the DAVID database revealed that genes that were differentially expressed at one and two weeks after irradiation were associated with biological processes such as morphogenesis of a branching structure, tube development, and cell proliferation. Analysis using Short Time-Series Expression Miner (STEM) revealed the temporal gene expression profiles and identified 13 significant patterns in four main groups of profiles. The genes in the upregulated temporal profile have diverse functions involved in the intracellular signaling cascade, cell proliferation, and cytokine-mediated signaling pathway. We show that tumor irradiation with a single 25-Gy dose can initiate a time-series of differentially expressed genes in TAMs, which are associated with the immune response, DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Our study helps to improve our understanding of the function of the group of genes whose expression changes temporally in an irradiated tumor microenvironment.",

     "abstract": "Recent advances in high-throughput genome sequencing technologies have enabled the systematic study of various genomes by making whole genome sequencing affordable. Modern sequencers generate a huge number of small sequence fragments called reads, where the read length and the per-base sequencing cost depend on the technology used. To date, many hybrid genome assembly algorithms have been developed that can take reads from multiple read sources to reconstruct the original genome. However, rigorous investigation of the feasibility conditions for complete genome reconstruction and the optimal sequencing strategy for minimizing the sequencing cost has been conspicuously missing. An important aspect of hybrid sequencing and assembly is that the feasibility conditions for genome reconstruction can be satisfied by different combinations of the available read sources, opening up the possibility of optimally combining the sources to minimize the sequencing cost while ensuring accurate genome reconstruction. In this paper, we derive the conditions for whole genome reconstruction from multiple read sources at a given confidence level and also introduce the optimal strategy for combining reads from different sources to minimize the overall sequencing cost. We show that the optimal read set, which simultaneously satisfies the feasibility conditions for genome reconstruction and minimizes the sequencing cost, can be effectively predicted through constrained discrete optimization. Through extensive evaluations based on several genomes and different read sets, we verify the derived feasibility conditions and demonstrate the performance of the proposed optimal hybrid sequencing and assembly strategy.",

We develop a systematic analysis pipeline to discover DNA methylation patterns for lncRNAs across multiple cancer subtypes from probe, gene and network levels. By using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer methylation data, the pipeline discovers various DNA methylation patterns for lncRNAs across four major subtypes such as luminal A, luminal B, her2-enriched as well as basal-like. On the probe and gene level, we find that both differentially methylated probes and lncRNAs are subtype specific, while the lncRNAs are not as specific as probes. On the network level, the pipeline constructs differential co-methylation lncRNA network for each subtype. Then, it identifies both subtype specific and common lncRNA modules by simultaneously analyzing multiple networks. We show that the lncRNAs in subtype specific and common modules differ greatly in terms of topological structure, sequence conservation as well as expression. Furthermore, the subtype specific lncRNA modules serve as biomarkers to improve significantly the accuracy of breast cancer subtypes prediction. Finally, the common lncRNA modules associate with survival time of patients, which is critical for cancer therapy.",

These requirements, despite their prevalence, lead to computationally harder algorithmic solutions and have been sparsely examined in the literature to date. In this article we prove some unique properties of most parsimonious live phylogenetic trees with polytomies, and their mapping to traditional binary phylogenetic trees.

PECC extracts sequence regions with lower paired-end reads supports and verifies them based on the distribution of paired-end supports. To validate the effectiveness of PECC, we applied PECC to the contigs produced by five popular assemblers on four real datasets, and we also carried out experiments to analyze the influences of PECC on scaffolding. The results show that PECC can reduce misassembly errors and improve the performance of scaffolding results, which demonstrate the promising applications of PECC in de novo assembly.",

The advent of high-throughput technologies brings convenience to the development of DTI prediction methods. With the generation of a high number of data sets, many mathematical models and computational algorithms have been developed to identify the potential drug–target pairs. However, most existing methods are proposed based on the single view data. By integrating the drug and target data from different views, we aim to get more stable and accurate prediction results.In this paper, a multiview DTI prediction method based on clustering is proposed. We first introduce a model for single view drug–target data. The model is formulated as an optimization problem, which aims to identify the clusters in both drug similarity network and target protein similarity network, and at the same time make the clusters with more known DTIs be connected together. Then the model is extended to multiview network data by maximizing the consistency of the clusters in each view. An approximation method is proposed to solve the optimization problem. We apply the proposed algorithms to two views of data. Comparisons with some existing algorithms show that the multiview DTI prediction algorithm can produce more accurate predictions. For the considered data set, we finally predict 54 possible DTIs. From the similarity analysis of the drugs/targets, enrichment analysis of DTIs and genes in each cluster, it is shown that the predicted DTIs have a high possibility to be true.",

In this work, we develop a node-based differential network analysis (N-DNA) model to directly estimate the differential network that is driven by certain hub nodes. We model each condition-specific gene network as a precision matrix and the differential network as the difference between two precision matrices. Then we formulate a convex optimization problem to infer the differential network by combing a D-trace loss function and a row-column overlap norm penalty function. Simulation studies demonstrate that N-DNA provides more accurate estimate of the differential network than previous competing approaches. We apply N-DNA to ovarian cancer and breast cancer gene expression data. The model rediscovers known cancer-related genes and contains interesting predictions.",

In response to this need, we propose a parallel algorithm, namely pVLASPD, to perform the prediction task in a distributed manner. In particular, pVLASPD was modified based on the VLASPD algorithm for the purpose of improving the efficiency of VLASPD while maintaining a comparable effectiveness. To do so, we first analyzed VLASPD step by step to identify the places that caused the bottlenecks of efficiency. After that, pVLASPD was developed by parallelizing those inefficient places with the framework of MapReduce.

Therefore, extraction of cavities is considered as a most important preprocessing step for finally predicting LBS. However, prediction of LBS based on cavity search subspace is found to fail for some proteins. To solve this problem a new search subspace was introduced which was found successful to localize LBS in most of the proteins used in this work for which cavity-based method MetaPocket 2.0 failed. Therefore this work appeared to augment well the existing binding site predictive methods through its applicability for complementary set of proteins for which cavity-based methods might fail. Also, to decide on the proteins for which instead of cavity-subspace the new subspace should be explored, a decision framework based on simple heuristic is made which uses geometric parameters of cavities extracted through MetaPocket 2.0.

     "abstract": "Nodulation is one of the very important processes of legume plants as it is the initiating event of fixing nitrogen. Although ethylene has essential role in normal plant metabolism but it has also negative impact on plants particularly in nodule formation in legume plants. It is also produced due to a variety of biotic or abiotic stresses. 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase is a rhizobial enzyme which cleaves ACC (immediate precursor of ethylene) into α-ketobutyrate and ammonia. As a result, the level of ethylene from the plant cells is decreased and the negative impact of ethylene on nodule formation is reduced. ACC deaminase is widely studied in several plant growth promoting rhizobacterial (PGPR) strains including many legume nodulating bacteria like Mesorhizobium sp. It is an important symbiotic nitrogen fixer belonging to the class – alphaproteobacteria under the order Rhizobiales. ACC deaminase has positive role in Legume-rhizobium symbiosis. Rhizobial ACC deaminase has the potentiality to reduce the adverse effects of ethylene, thereby triggering the nodulation process.

We propose that the complementarity determining region (CDR3) of HER3 Nb is large enough to effectively interact with HER3 antigen as well as with the entire Nb. A computational analysis has been performed using Nb models retrieved from SWISS-pdb Viewer 4.1.0 (spdbv) as a target spot and HER3 extracellular domain as its antigenic target to identify the interactions between them by the protein–protein docking method. Detailed analysis of selected models with docked complex help us to identify the interacting amino acid residues between the two molecules. The results of in silico analysis show that the CDR3 of HER3 Nb might be used by itself as a peptidomimetic drug instead of the full Nb. HER3 peptidomimetic-derived HER3 Nb may reduce Nb production costs and be used as a substitute for HER3 Nb after further experimental work. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of peptidomimetics designs using bioinformatic tools.",

Cancer cells derive most of their energy from oxidative phosphorylation unlike normal ones during cell progression TSPO protein present in external mitochondrial membrane, is involved in various cellular functions like Cell proliferation, mitochondrial respiration, synthesis of steroids and also participates in import of cholesterol into the inner mitochondrial membrane from outside of the membrane of mitochondria.The 3D model of TSPO protein is built using comparative homology modelling techniques and validated by proSA, Ramachandran plot and ERRAT in the present work. Active site prediction is carried out using SiteMap and literature, which allows the prediction of the important binding pockets for the identification of putative active site. New molecular entities as TSPO inhibitors were obtained from Virtual screening using MS Spectrum databank in Schrodinger suite and were prioritised based on Glide Score. Docking was performed using Autodock to identify molecules with different scaffolds and were prioritised based on binding energy and RMSD values. Qikprop is used to calculate pharmacokinetic properties of the screened molecules which are found to be in permissible range as possible novel inhibitors of TSPO protein to supress cell proliferation.",

The resulted ten structure-based hypotheses were then refined to essential three point pharmacophore features that captured recurring and crucial non-covalent receptor contacts and proposed three characteristics necessary for optimal zone-2 binding: a conserved pair of H bond acceptor (HBA to form H bond with Asn226 residue) and an aliphatic moiety of molecule separated by 3.75 ± 0.44 Å. Further, an aliphatic or a heterocyclic group distant (11.75 ± 1.14 Å) to the conserved aliphatic site formed the third feature component in the zone-2 specific anthelmintic pharmacophore model. Alternatively, an additional HBA can be substituted as a third component to establish H bonding with Asn204.

In present study, protein structure prediction, ligand-based pharmacophore modeling, virtual screening, molecular docking and dynamic simulation study were used to screen the strong novel inhibitor to cure melanogenesis. The 3D structures of PPO1 and PPO2 were built through homology modeling, while the 3D crystal structures of PPO3 and PPO4 were retrieved from PDB. Pharmacophore modeling was performed using LigandScout 3.1 software and top five models were selected to screen the libraries (2601 of Aurora and 727, 842 of ZINC). Top 10 hit compounds (C1-10) were short-listed having strong binding affinities for PPO1-4. Drug and synthetic accessibility (SA) scores along with absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) assessment were employed to scrutinize the best lead hit. C4 (name) hit showed the best predicted SA score (5.75), ADMET properties and drug-likeness behavior among the short-listed compounds. Furthermore, docking simulations were performed to check the binding affinity of C1-C10 compounds against target proteins (PPOs). The binding affinity values of complex between C4 and PPOs were higher than those of other complexes (−11.70, −12.1, −9.90 and −11.20 kcal/mol with PPO1, PPO2, PPO3, or PPO4, respectively). From comparative docking energy and binding analyses, PPO2 may be considered as better target for melanogenesis than others.

These transporters mediate drug transport; however, the precise mechanism of drug-binding and transport by them is not fully uncovered yet, partly due to unavailability of any crystal structure record. In this work, we performed a multi-phasic approach to compute the 3D structural models of seven human organic cation transporters (hOCTs) starting from primary protein sequence. Our structure modeling approach included 1) I-TASSER based comparative sequence alignment, threading and ab-initio protein modeling; 2) models comparison with PSIPRED secondary structure prediction; 3) loop modeling for incongruent secondary structure in Chimera 1.10.1; 4) high resolution structure simulation, refinement, energy minimization using ModRefiner, and 5) validation of the structure models using PROCHECK at SAVEs. From structural point, the computed 3D structures of hOCTs consist of a typical major facilitator superfamily (MFS) fold of twelve α-transmembrane helix domains arranged in a manner rendering hOCTs a barrel shaped structure with a large cleft that opens in cytoplasm. The modeled 3D structure of all hOCTs closely resemble to human SLC2A3 (GLUT3) transporter (PDB ID: 5c65) and displayed an outward-open confirmation and putative cyclic C1 protein symmetry. In addition, hOCTs has a large (>100 amino acids) unique extracellular loop between TMH1 and TMH2 having potential glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr) and cysteine residues, both features indicative of putative role in drug binding and uptake. There is an intracellular three/four-helix loop between TMH6 and TMH7 containing putative phosphorylation sites for precise regulation of hOCTs function as drug transporters. There are nine loops of 4 to 11 amino acids length that protrude from membrane, both intracellularly and extracellularly, and connect adjacent TMHs. The 2D structure prediction showed Nin-Cin topology of all hOCTs. In the unavailability of the crystal structures of hOCTs, the 3D structural models computed in-silico and presented herein can be used for studying the mechanism of drug binding and transport by hOCTs.",

Though mutations of the ADIPOR2 gene are detrimental, there is a lack of comprehensive in silico analyses of the functional and structural impacts at the protein level. Considering the involvement of ADIPOR2 in glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation, an in silico functional analysis was conducted to explore the possible association between genetic mutations and phenotypic variations. A genomic analysis of 82 nonsynonymous SNPs in ADIPOR2 was initiated using SIFT followed by the SNAP2, nsSNPAnalyzer, PolyPhen-2, SNPs&GO, FATHMM and PROVEAN servers. A total of 10 mutations (R126W, L160Q, L195P, F201S, L235R, L235P, L256R, Y328H, E334K and Q349H) were predicted to have deleterious effects on the ADIPOR2 protein and were therefore selected for further analysis. Theoretical models of the variants were generated by comparative modeling via MODELLER 9.16. A protein structural analysis of these amino acid variants was performed using SNPeffect, I-Mutant, ConSurf, Swiss-PDB Viewer and NetSurfP to explore their solvent accessibility, molecular dynamics and energy minimization calculations. In addition, FTSite was used to predict the ligand binding sites, while NetGlycate, NetPhos2.0, UbPerd and SUMOplot were used to predict post-translational modification sites. All of the variants showed increased free energy, though F201S exhibited the highest energy increase. The root mean square deviation values of the modeled mutants strongly indicated likely pathogenicity. Remarkably, three binding sites were detected on ADIPOR2, and two mutations at positions 328 and 201 were found in the first and second binding pockets, respectively. Interestingly, no mutations were found at the post-translational modification sites. These genetic variants can provide a better understanding of the wide range of disease susceptibility associated with ADIPOR2 and aid the development of new molecular diagnostic markers for these diseases. The findings may also facilitate the development of novel therapeutic elements for associated diseases.",

     "abstract": "Computational prediction of the interaction between protein transcription factors and their cognate DNA binding sites in genomic promoters constitutes a formidable challenge in two situations: when the number of discriminatory interactions is small compared to the length of the binding site, and when DNA binding sites possess a poorly conserved consensus binding motif. The transcription factor p53 tumor suppressor protein and its target DNA exhibit both of these issues. From crystal structure analysis, only three discriminatory amino acid side chains contact the DNA for a binding site spanning ten base pairs. Furthermore, our analysis of a dataset of genome wide fragments binding to p53 revealed many sequences lacking the expected consensus. The low information content leads to an overestimation of binding sites, and the lack of conservation equates to a computational alignment problem. Within a fragment of DNA known to bind to p53, computationally locating the position of the site equates to aligning the DNA with the binding interface. From a molecular perspective, that alignment implies a specification of which DNA bases are interacting with which amino acid side chains, and aligning many sequences to the same protein interface concomitantly produces a multiple sequence alignment. From this vantage, we propose to cast prediction of p53 binding sites as an alignment to the protein binding surface with the novel approach of optimizing the alignment of DNA fragments to the p53 binding interface based on chemical principles. A scoring scheme based on this premise was successfully implemented to score a dataset of biological DNA fragments known to contain p53 binding sites. The results illuminate the mechanism of recognition for the protein-DNA system at the forefront of cancer research. These findings implicate that p53 may recognize its target binding sites via several different mechanisms which may include indirect readout.",

In the current report, we are documenting theoretical analysis and derivation of general formula [ 2 × 4 { ( n 2 ) − 1 } ] to predict possible distinct cysteine patterns for given ‘n’ even number of cysteine residues in a sequence. Combined formula of predicting distinct cysteine patterns and different disulfide isomers can be used to deduce the truly available structural space of intramolecular peptide disulfides, which may be used in structural analysis of disulfide rich peptides and proteins. In this report, we have also analyzed cysteine patterns and disulfide connectivities of peptide toxins, which is the largest group of intramolecular peptide disulfide natural products, retrieved from publically available animal toxin databases. Observed 29 distinct cysteine patterns of toxins exhibited 61 unique intramolecular disulfide folds, with limitation of having up to eight cysteine residues in a sequence, compared to theoretically available 170 different cysteine patterns generating 13,946 distinct intramolecular disulfide folds. Database analysis of peptide toxins has also revealed the features of presence of same intramolecular disulfide motif in functionally divergent peptide toxins and adaptation of the same disulfide fold with similar functions in different venomous species. Calculations of relative accessible surface area of cystine and average value of non-cysteine residues in the representative intramolecular disulfide folds of peptide toxins has revealed the feature of poor accessibility of cystine to external agents and their dependency on number of disulfide bonds in the sequence. Implementation of new generation sequencing methods and novel disulfide mapping techniques will unravel hidden diversity of intramolecular disulfide motifs of toxins and current report points to the selection of disulfide motifs in peptide toxins.",

DrugClust pipeline works as follows: first drugs are clustered with respect to their features and then side effects predictions are made, according to Bayesian scores. Biological validation of resulting clusters can be done via enrichment analysis, another functionality implemented in the methodology. This last tool is of extreme interest for drug discovery, given that it can be used as a validation of the clusters obtained, as well as for the study of new possible interactions between certain side effects and nontargeted pathways.Results were evaluated on a 5-folds cross validations procedure, and extensive comparisons were made with available datasets in the field: Zhang et al.

Genomic analyses of IR have illuminated its crucial role in shaping the evolution of genomes, in the control of developmental processes, and in the dynamic regulation of the transcriptome to influence phenotype. To explore the relationship between the sequence feature and the formation mechanism of IR, we statistically analyzed the retained introns and proposed an improved random forest-based hybrid method to predict intron retention events in plant genome. The results indicate that IR has significant relationship with individual introns which have weaker 5’ splice sites, lower GC content and less termination codon occurrence. By the method we proposed, 93.48% retained introns can be correctly distinguished from constitutive introns. Strikingly, our study will facilitate a better understanding of underlying mechanisms involved in intron retention.",

     "abstract": "The P-type ATPases (P-ATPases) are present in all living cells where they mediate ion transport across membranes on the expense of ATP hydrolysis. Different ions which are transported by these pumps are protons like calcium, sodium, potassium, and heavy metals such as manganese, iron, copper, and zinc. Maintenance of the proper gradients for essential ions across cellular membranes makes P-ATPases crucial for cell survival. In this study, characterization of two families of P-ATPases including P-ATPase 13A1 and P-ATPase 13A3 protein was compared in two different insect species from different orders. According to the conserved motifs found with MEME, nine motifs were shared by insects of 13A1 family but eight in 13A3 family. Seven different insect species from 13A1 and five samples from 13A3 family were selected as the representative samples for functional and structural analyses. The structural and functional analyses were performed with ProtParam, SOPMA, SignalP 4.1, TMHMM 2.0, ProtScale and ProDom tools in the ExPASy database. The tertiary structure of Bombus terrestris as a sample of each family of insects were predicted by the Phyre2 and TM-score servers and their similarities were verified by SuperPose server. The tertiary structures were predicted via the “c3b9bA” model (PDB Accession Code: 3B9B) in P-ATPase 13A1 family and “c2zxeA” model (PDB Accession Code: 2ZXE) in P-ATPase 13A3 family. A phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA 6.06 software using the Neighbor-joining method. According to the results, there was a high identity of P-ATPase families so that they should be derived from a common ancestor however they belonged to separate groups. In protein–protein interaction analysis by STRING 10.0, six common enriched pathways of KEGG were identified in B. terrestris in both families. The obtained data provide a background for bioinformatic studies of the function and evolution of other insects and organisms.",

The bacterium has developed resistance to all known classes of antibiotics. Multi-drug resistant A. baumannii infections have been treated with the carbapenem group of antibiotics like imipenem and meropenem. Recent reports indicate that A. baumannii has acquired resistance to imipenem due to the secretion of carbapenem hydrolysing class D beta-lactamases (CHDLs). Such CHDLs found in carbapenem resistant A. baumannii belongs to OXA-143 and its variant OXA-231, which has Alanine (A) in place of Aspartic acid (D) at sequence position 224. The mutation of the OXA-231 CHDL alters the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Hence, the present study was carried out to find the probable mechanism of imipenem resistance in OXA-143 and OXA-231 (D224A) CHDLs expressing A. baumannii by employing molecular docking and dynamics. Methods Our study reveals that OXA-143 CHDL-imipenem complex has more binding affinity than OXA-231 (D224A) CHDL-imipenem complex. Our results indicate that there is a strong binding affinity of OXA-143 with imipenem when compared with OXA-243 and this mechanism might be the probable reason for imipenem resistance in OXA-143 expressing A. baumannii strains.",

The molecular mechanism of denitrification process is definitely complex and in this case a theoretical investigation has been conducted to know the sequence information and amino acid composition of the active site of CuNiR enzyme using various Bioinformatics tools. 10 Fasta formatted sequences were retrieved from the NCBI database and the domain and disordered regions identification and phylogenetic analyses were done on these sequences. The comparative modeling of protein was performed through Modeller 9v14 program and visualized by PyMOL tools. Validated protein models were deposited in the Protein Model Database (PMDB) (PMDB id: PM0080150 to PM0080159). Active sites of nirk encoding CuNiR enzyme were identified by Castp server. The PROCHECK showed significant scores for four protein models in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot. Active sites and cavities prediction exhibited that the amino acid, namely Glycine, Alanine, Histidine, Aspartic acid, Glutamic acid, Threonine, and Glutamine were common in four predicted protein models. The present in silico study anticipates that active site analyses result will pave the way for further research on the complex denitrification mechanism of the selected species in the experimental laboratory.",

     "abstract": "In recent years, Metal-chelating compounds, namely siderphores have been considered very much because of their crucial role in various fields of the environmental researches. Their importance lies in the fact that they are able to be bonded to a variety of metals in addition to iron. A theoretical study on the structures of desferrithiocin siderphore coordinated to Mg2+, Al3+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ metal ions was carried out, using the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of the theory in the water. In order to understand the factors which control the stability, reactivity and the strength of toxic metals excretion as well as microbial uptake of the metal-siderphore complexes, we examined the stability and binding energies of the desferrithiocin and various metal ions with different spin states. The binding affinity of desferrithiocin to Fe3+ (log β2 = 23.88) showed that the desferrithiocin can scavenge the excess iron(III) from the labile sources. Also, the binding energy values were well described by addition of the dispersion-corrected D3 functional. Because of the importance of the charge transfer in the complex formation, donor-acceptor interaction energies were evaluated. Based on this analysis, an increase in the effective nuclear charge increases E(2) values. Vibrational analysis showed that the critical bonds (CO stretching and CH bending) are in the range of 1300–1800 cm−1. Finally, some probable correlations between the complexation behavior and quantum chemistry descriptors have been analyzed.",

In our study, we predicted eight nsSNPs i.e., rs74315393 (Ile146Asn), rs368205448 (Asp121Tyr), rs143321797 (Phe45Ser), rs17847261 (Cys274Ser), rs144166442 (Pro257His), rs370533946 (Leu224Pro), rs371354428 (Pro72Leu) and rs373708098 (Gly249Ser) found to be potentially deleterious. The functional impact of three nsSNPs i.e., rs74315393, rs368205448 and rs143321797 have already been validated experimentally in the context of human obesity. Moreover, Homology modeling and structural analysis were carried out for already experimentally validated nsSNPs i.e., rs74315393, rs368205448 and rs143321797 to check the stability of predicted models. The mutant models showed higher energy and RMSD (Root mean square deviation) values. In addition, FTSite server predicted one nsSNP i.e., rs368205448 (Asp121Tyr) out of eight identified nsSNPs found in the MC3R protein binding site.

In order to probe the role of the R119G mutation in cutis laxa, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, essential dynamics (ED) analysis, and Molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) binding free energy calculations on wild type (WT) and mutant P5CR-NAD complex. These MD simulations and ED analyses suggest that the R119G mutation decreases the flexibility of P5CR, specifically in the substrate binding pocket, which could decrease the kinetics of the cofactor entrance and egress.

To investigate the differences in metabolic pathways among patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and differential survival outcomes, we systematically conducted microarray data analysis of the metabolic gene expression profiles from 384 patients available from the Gene Expression Omnibus and Cancer Genome Atlas databases. Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that the metabolic differences between low-risk and high-risk patients mainly existed in two pathways: biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and oxidative phosphorylation. Using the gene-pathway bipartite network, 62 metabolic genes were identified from 272 DEGs involved in 88 metabolic pathways. Based on the expression patterns of the 62 genes, patients with shorter overall survival (OS) durations in the training set (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.58, p = 0.038) and in two test sets (HR = 1.69 and 1.56 and p = 0.089 and 0.029, respectively) were well discriminated by hierarchical clustering analysis. Notably, the expression profiles of ALAS2, BCAT1, BLVRB, and HK3 showed distinct differences between the low-risk and high-risk patients. In addition, models for predicting the OS outcome of AML from the 62 gene signatures achieved improved performance compared with previous studies. In conclusion, our findings reveal significant differences in metabolic processes of patients with AML with diverse survival durations and provide valuable information for clinical translation.",

A current challenge within docking simulations is the incorporation of receptor flexibility. A useful strategy toward solving such problem would be the docking of a typical ligand into the multiple conformations of the target. In this study, a multifactor response surface model was constructed to estimate the AutoDock based binding free energy of fluconazole within multiple conformations of 14α-demethylase (CYP51) (cross docking) as a validated antifungal target. On the basis of developed models, individual and interactive effects of important experimental parameters on cross docking of fluconazole were elucidated. For this purpose, a set of high-resolution holo crystallographic structures from CYP51 of human pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi were retrieved to statistically model the binding mode and affinity of fluconazole. The changes of AutoDock binding free energy for the complexes of CYP51-fluconazole were elucidated with the simultaneous variations of six independent variables including grid size, grid spacing, number of genetic algorithm (GA) runs, maximum number of energy evaluations, torsion degrees for ligand and quaternion degrees for ligand. It was revealed that grid spacing (distance between adjacent grid points) and maximum number of energy evaluations were two significant model terms. It was also revealed that grid size, torsion degrees for ligand and quaternion degrees for ligand had insignificant effects on estimated binding energy while the effect of GA runs was non-significant. The interactive effect of “torsion degrees for ligand” with number of GA runs was found to be the significant factor. Other important interactive effects were the interaction of “number of GA runs” with “grid spacing” and “number of energy evaluations” with “grid size”. Furthermore; results of modeling studies within several CYP51 conformations exhibited that “number of GA runs” and “number of energy evaluations” were less sensitive to varied target conformations.",

However, the clinical utility of apigenin is limited due to its low solubility. It was reported that the solubility and biological activity can be improved by introducing sole carboxyalkyl group into apigenin, especially the 7′-substitution. With the increase of length of the alkyl chain in carboxyalkyl group, B ring of the apigenin derivative is embedded much more deeply into the binding cavity while the carboxyalkyl stretches to the neighboring cavity. All of the terminal carboxyl groups form hydrogen bonding interactions easily with the surrounding polar amino acids, such as His239, Ser244, Arg312 and Asp349. Thus, the electron density values of the carbonyl in the carboxyl group become higher than the solution status due to the strong molecular interactions. In fact, electron densities of most of the chemical bonds are decreased after molecular docking procedure. On compared with the solution phase, however, dipole moments of most of these molecules are increased, and their vectors are reoriented distinctly in the active sites. It is noticed that all of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) are distributed throughout the whole parent apigenin ring in solution phase, whereas the disappeared situation happened on the B rings of some molecules (II–IV) in the active site, leading to higher energy gaps.",

In present study, we performed a comparative study to investigate binding efficacies of three phytomolecules namely, Demethylcalabaxanthone, Cryptolepine hydrochloride and Ermanin. 3D structures of PknB and phytomolecules were retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 2FUM) and PubChem Chemical Compound Database, respectively. PknB was set to be rigid and phytochemicals were kept free to rotate. All computational simulations were carried out using Autodock 4.0 on Windows platform.

The identification of ES proteins through experimental methods are expensive and time consuming while bioinformatics approaches are cost-effective by prioritizing the experimental analysis of potential drug targets for parasitic diseases. In this study, we predicted and functionally annotated the 1889 ES proteins in M. incognita genome using integration of several bioinformatics tools.

Of the C. elegans homologues, 17 ES proteins had “loss of function phenotype” by RNA interference and could represent potential drug targets for parasite intervention and control. We could functionally annotate 429 (22.7%) ES proteins using Gene Ontology (GO) terms, 672 (35.5%) proteins to protein domains and established pathway associations for 223 (11.8%) sequences using Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).

In this paper, we sequentially applied a two-level design and a follow-up orthogonal array composite design (OACD) to investigate combinations of five anti-cancer drugs, namely, doxorubicin, docetaxel, paclitaxel, cis-dichlorodiamine platinum and dihydroartemisinin. Our initial screening using a two-level full factorial design identified doxorubicin and docetaxel as the most significant drugs. A follow-up experiment with an OACD revealed more complicated drug interactions among these 5 anti-cancer drugs. Quadratic effects of doxorubicin and paclitaxel appeared to be significant. A further investigation on contour plots of all the two-drug pairs indicated that combination of doxorubicin and docetaxel are the most effective companion, while the combination of cis-dichlorodiamine platinum and dihydroartemisinin showed unknown antagonistic effects which diminished the individual drug anti-cancer efficacy. These observations have significant practical implications in the understanding of anti-cancer drug mechanism that can facilitate clinical practice of better drug combinations.",

In the present study, an in silico approach was applied to design a novel multi-epitope vaccine to elicit a desirable immune response against atherosclerosis. Six novel IL-4 inducing epitopes were selected from HSP60 and calreticulin proteins. To enhance epitope presentation, IL-4 inducing epitopes were linked together by AAY and HEYGAEALERAG linkers. In addition, helper epitopes selected from Tetanus toxin fragment C (TTFrC) were applied to induce CD4+ helper T lymphocytes (HTLs) responses. Moreover, cholera toxin B (CTB) was employed as an adjuvant. A multi-epitope construct was designed based on predicted epitopes which was 320 residues in length. Then, the physico-chemical properties, secondary and tertiary structures, stability, intrinsic protein disorder, solubility and allergenicity of this chimeric protein were analyzed using bioinformatics tools and servers. Based on bioinformatics analysis, a soluble, and non-allergic protein with 35.405 kDa molecular weight was designed. Expasy ProtParam classified this chimeric protein as a stable protein. In addition, predicted epitopes in the chimeric vaccine indicated strong potential to induce B-cell mediated immune response and shift immune responses toward protective Th2 immune response.

Among these, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis contained the maximum numbers of 35 co-expressed genes, and cell cycle were enriched by the second largest number of 11 co-expressed genes, respectively.The identified pathways such as ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and cell cycle might play important roles in the development of asthma and may be useful for developing the credible therapeutic approaches for diagnosis and treatment of asthma in future.",

The present work endeavors rational designing of some novel PPAR-γ agonists bearing benzylideneamino-benzylidene-thiazolidine-2,4-dione scaffold. The research involved virtual screening of 37 different molecules by molecular docking studies performed by Molecular Design Suite (MDS) into the ligand binding domain of PPAR-γ receptor to explore the binding affinity and conformations of the molecules. Eight compounds; TZD1, TZD-4, TZD-7, TZD-16, TZD-25, TZD-28, TZD-34, and TZD-37 demonstrated high affinity for PPAR-γ binding site. The following compounds were taken into the account and synthesized using a multi-step synthesis protocol. The purity of the synthesized compounds was ascertained by sophisticated analytical techniques such as IR, NMR, Mass and elemental analysis. The compounds were tested for glucose uptake assay by using 3T3-L1 cell lines, where all the candidates exhibited nearly similar potential for uptake of glucose into the lines as that of standard drug rosiglitazone. Three molecules; TZD-1, TZD-4, and TZD-34 showed most prominent activity over hyperglycemic control. This research opened new avenues for smart designing of molecules with high efficiency towards the management of hyperglycemia.",

However, they are not effective to learn various properties of binding site residues caused by various interactions between proteins and sugars. In this study, we classified sugars into acidic and nonacidic sugars and showed that their binding sites have different amino acid occurrence frequencies. By using this result, we developed sugar-binding residue predictors dedicated to the two classes of sugars: an acid sugar binding predictor and a nonacidic sugar binding predictor. We also developed a combination predictor which combines the results of the two predictors. We showed that when a sugar is known to be an acidic sugar, the acidic sugar binding predictor achieves the best performance, and showed that when a sugar is known to be a nonacidic sugar or is not known to be either of the two classes, the combination predictor achieves the best performance. Our method uses only amino acid sequences for prediction. Support vector machine was used as a machine learning algorithm and the position-specific scoring matrix created by the position-specific iterative basic local alignment search tool was used as the feature vector.

They are involved in the regulation of gene expression and antiviral defense through RNA interference pathways. A model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana encodes four DCL proteins (AtDCL1-4) that produce different classes of small regulatory RNAs. Our studies focus on AtDCL4 that processes double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) into 21 nucleotide trans-acting small interfering RNAs. So far, little is known about the structures of plant DCLs and the complexes they form with dsRNA. In this work, we present models of the catalytic core of AtDCL4 and AtDCL4-dsRNA complex constructed by computational methods.We built a homology model of the catalytic core of AtDCL4 comprising Platform, PAZ, Connector helix and two RNase III domains. To assemble the AtDCL4-dsRNA complex two modeling approaches were used. In the first method, to establish conformations that allow building a consistent model of the complex, we used Normal Mode Analysis for both dsRNA and AtDCL4. The second strategy involved template-based approach for positioning of the PAZ domain and manual arrangement of the Connector helix. Our results suggest that the spatial orientation of the Connector helix, Platform and PAZ relative to the RNase III domains is crucial for measuring dsRNA of defined length. The modeled complexes provide information about interactions that may contribute to the relative orientations of these domains and to dsRNA binding. All these information can be helpful for understanding the mechanism of AtDCL4-mediated dsRNA recognition and binding, to produce small RNA of specific size.",

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding free energy calculations and continuum model analysis revealed that the electrostatic effect plays a predominant role in domain–peptide binding, while other noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces are also responsible for the binding. The computational findings were then used to guide structure-based optimization of the interfacial salt-bridge network. Consequently, five peptides were rationally designed using the high-affinity binder Cyto8-RETEV (RETEV−COOH) as template, including four single-point mutants (i.e. Cyto8-mtxe0: RETE E −COOH, Cyto8-mtxd-1: RET D V−COOH, Cyto8-mtxd-3: R D TEV−COOH and Cyto8-mtxk-4: K ETEV−COOH) and one double-point mutant (i.e. Cyto8-mtxd-1k-4: K ET D V−COOH).

Evaluation experiments were conducted on three protein datasets and the results show that our method can enhance eukaryotic and human subcellular location prediction accuracy by up to 1.1% better than previous studies that also used GO-based features.

Different free radical scavenging mechanisms are investigated in water and pentyl ethanoate as a solvent. By considering electronic properties of scavenged free radicals, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and sequential proton loss electron transfer (SPLET) mechanisms are found to be thermodynamically probable and competitive processes in both media. The Gibbs free energy change for reaction of inactivation of free radicals indicates 3-HPAA and 4-HPPA as potent scavengers. Their reactivity toward free radicals was predicted to decrease as follows: hydroxyl >> alkoxyls > phenoxyl ≈ peroxyls >> superoxide. Shown free radical scavenging potency of 3-HPAA and 4-HPPA along with their high μM concentration produced by microbial colon degradation of polyphenols could enable at least in situ inactivation of free radicals.

A mutation, F1174C, suited in the C-terminal helix αC of ALK and distal from the small-molecule inhibitor ceritinib bound to the ATP-binding site, causes the emergence of drug resistance to ceritinib. However, the detailed mechanism for the allosteric effect of F1174C resistance mutation to ceritinib remains unclear. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding free energy calculations [Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA)] were carried out to explore the advent of drug resistance mutation in ALK. MD simulations observed that the exquisite aromatic-aromatic network formed by residues F1098, F1174, F1245, and F1271 in the wild-type ALK-ceritinib complex was disrupted by the F1174C mutation. The resulting mutation allosterically affected the conformational dynamic of P-loop and caused the upward movement of the P-loop from the ATP-binding site, thereby weakening the interaction between ceritinib and the P-loop. The subsequent MM/GBSA binding free energy calculations and decomposition analysis of binding free energy validated this prediction. This study provides mechanistic insight into the allosteric effect of F1174C resistance mutation to ceritinib in ALK and is expected to contribute to design the next-generation of ALK inhibitors.",

Further, the selected antigenic sequences (having B-cell epitopes) were analyzed for T-cell epitopes (MHC I and MHC II alleles binding sequence) by using ProPred 1 and ProPred respectively. The epitope (9 mer: YKSISPQDA) that binds to both the MHC classes (MHC I and MHC II) and covers maximum MHC alleles were identified. The identified epitopes can be useful in designing comprehensive peptide vaccine development against V. cholerae by inducing optimal immune response.",

     "abstract": "Protein complex detection from protein–protein interaction (PPI) network has received a lot of focus in recent years. A number of methods identify protein complexes as dense sub-graphs using network information while several other methods detect protein complexes based on topological information. While the methods based on identifying dense sub-graphs are more effective in identifying protein complexes, not all protein complexes have high density. Moreover, existing methods focus more on static PPI networks and usually overlook the dynamic nature of protein complexes. Here, we propose a new method, Weighted Edge based Clustering (WEC), to identify protein complexes based on the weight of the edge between two interacting proteins, where the weight is defined by the edge clustering coefficient and the gene expression correlation between the interacting proteins. Our WEC method is capable of detecting highly inter-connected and co-expressed protein complexes. The experimental results of WEC on three real life data shows that our method can detect protein complexes effectively in comparison with other highly cited existing methods.Availability: The WEC tool is available at http://agnigarh.tezu.ernet.in/~rosy8/shared.html.",

We have applied protein–protein interaction methodology to identify new drug-target candidates (orthologs) in Burkhloderia cepacia GG4, which is an important strain for studying the quorum-sensing phenomena. An evolutionary based ortholog mapping approach has been applied for generating the large scale protein–protein interactions in B. Cepacia. As a case study, one of the identified drug targets; GEM_3202, a NH (3)-dependent NAD synthetase protein has been studied and the potential ligand molecules were screened using the ZINC database. The three dimensional structure (NH (3)-dependent NAD synthetase protein) has been predicted from MODELLERv9.11 tool using multiple PDB templates such as 3DPI, 2PZ8 and 1NSY with sequence identity of 76%, 50% and 50% respectively.

The three studied patients with PFIC3 were screened by PCR amplification followed by direct sequencing of the 27 coding exons of ABCB4. In silico analysis was performed by bioinformatic programs.

In general, high binding to MHCs approximately correlates with in vivo immunogenicity. Consequently, a molecular docking technique was run on a library of novel discontinuous peptides predicted by PEPOP from Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 ECD) subdomain III.

Molecular docking analysis through GOLD identified the peptide 1412 as the best MHC binder peptide to both MHC class I and II molecules used in the study.

Despite numerous methods for predicting T-cell epitopes, there still exist limitations that affect the reliability of prevailing methods. For this reason, the development of models with high accuracy are crucial. An accurate prediction of the peptides that bind to specific major histocompatibility complex class I and II (MHC-I and MHC-II) molecules is important for an understanding of the functioning of the immune system and the development of peptide-based vaccines. Peptide binding is the most selective step in identifying T-cell epitopes. In this paper, we present a new approach to predicting MHC-binding ligands that takes into account new weighting schemes for position-based amino acid frequencies, BLOSUM and VOGG substitution of amino acids, and the physicochemical and molecular properties of amino acids. We have made models for quantitatively and qualitatively predicting MHC-binding ligands. Our models are based on two machine learning methods support vector machine (SVM) and support vector regression (SVR), where our models have used for feature selection, several different encoding and weighting schemes for peptides. The resulting models showed comparable, and in some cases better, performance than the best existing predictors. The obtained results indicate that the physicochemical and molecular properties of amino acids (AA) contribute significantly to the peptide-binding affinity.",

In this study, a genome-wide in silico analysis was carried out to dissect the structure and function of DREB2 family transcription factors in the rice genome. Using Arabidopsis DREB2 sequences a total of five rice DREB2 homologs were identified and they were distributed among four chromosomes. All OsDREBs contained the AP2 domain and unique [K/R]GKKGPxN motif characteristic to DREB2 family. During rice growth and development, three OsDREB2s namely OsDREB2A, OsDREB2B and OsABI4 were expressed and their expression was confined to embryo and endosperm tissues. OsDREB2A, OsDREB2B and OsDREB2C were expressed under abiotic stress conditions. OsDREB2B was expressed under drought, salinity and cold stress conditions while OsDREB2A and OsDREB2C were expressed only under drought and salinity conditions. The putative promoter regions of OsDREB2s were enriched with elements related to cellular development, hormonal regulation and stress response validating the observed expression dynamics. Co-expression analysis revealed that embryo development and stress related genes were expressed together with OsDREB2s. Predicted post-translational modifications indicated the fine regulation of OsDREB2s.

Geometry optimizations reflect the significant solvent and electronic effect. The proton departs spontaneously upon oxidation from the hydroxyl group of tyrosyl in hydrogen bonded Tyr⋯Asp⋯Arg triads in both gas phase and solvents. The electron transfer isomers are observed for anionic triads, no matter what the solvent is. The difference of distance between two hydrogen bonds is enlarged in solvent as compared to that in gas phase. The electronic effect on IR spectra is distinctive. The tyrosyl fragment tends to be oxidized and the arginine moiety is easier to bind an excess electron. The variations of chemical shift and spin-spin coupling constant are more significant upon electron transfer than upon solvent dielectric constant. The augmentation of solvent dielectric constant stabilizes the system, enhances the difference of isomers, and increases the vertical ionization potential and vertical electron affinity values.",

     "abstract": "Epigenetic regulation has been linked to the initiation and progression of cancer. Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is one such mechanism that can activate or silence oncogenes (OCGs) and tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in cells. A growing number of studies suggest that miRNA expression can be regulated by methylation modification, thus triggering cancer development. However, there is no comprehensive in silico study concerning miRNA regulation by direct DNA methylation in cancer. Ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OSC) was therefore chosen as a tumor model for the present work.Twelve batches of OSC data, with at least 35 patient samples in each batch, were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) was used to quantify the correlation between the CpG DNA methylation level and miRNA expression level. Meta-analysis was performed to reduce the effects of biological heterogeneity among different batches. MiRNA-target interactions were also inferred by computing SRCC and meta-analysis to assess the correlation between miRNA expression and cancer-associated gene expression and the interactions were further validated by a query against the miRTarBase database.A total of 26 potential epigenetic-regulated miRNA genes that can target OCGs or TSGs in OSC were found to show biological relevance between DNA methylation and miRNA gene expression. Furthermore, some of the identified DNA-methylated miRNA genes; for instance, the miR-200 family, were previously identified as epigenetic-regulated miRNAs and correlated with poor survival of ovarian cancer. We also found that several miRNA target genes, BTG3, NDN, HTRA3, CDC25A, and HMGA2 were also related to the poor outcomes in ovarian cancer.The present study proposed a systematic strategy to construct highly confident epigenetic-regulated miRNA pathways for OSC. The findings are validated and are in line with the literature. The inclusion of direct DNA methylated miRNA events may offer another layer of explanation that along with genetics can give a better understanding of the carcinogenesis process.",

Herein, we developed a specialized tool BS-RNA, which can analyze cytosine methylation of RNA based on bisulfite sequencing data and support both paired-end and single-end sequencing reads from directional bisulfite libraries. For paired-end reads, simply removing the biased positions from the 5′ end may result in “dovetailing” reads, where one or both reads seem to extend past the start of the mate read. BS-RNA could map “dovetailing” reads successfully.

The aim of this report was to improve the quality of SNP identification in bacterial genomes without closely related references. We developed a bioinformatics pipeline (SnpFilt) that constructs an assembly using SPAdes and then removes unreliable regions based on the quality and coverage of re-aligned reads at neighbouring regions. The performance of the pipeline was compared against reference-based SNP calling for Illumina HiSeq, MiSeq and NextSeq reads from a range of bacterial pathogens including Salmonella, which is one of the most common causes of food-borne disease. The SnpFilt pipeline removed all false SNP in all test NGS datasets consisting of paired-end Illumina reads. We also showed that for reliable and complete SNP calls, at least 40-fold coverage is required. Analysis of bacterial isolates associated with epidemiologically confirmed outbreaks using the SnpFilt pipeline produced results consistent with previously published findings. The SnpFilt pipeline improves the quality of de-novo assembly and precision of SNP calling in bacterial genomes by removal of regions of the assembly that may potentially contain assembly errors.

However, it does not take into consideration the intrinsic geometric structures in data.In this paper, a new method named Laplacian regularized Low-Rank Representation (LLRR) has been proposed and applied on genomic data, which introduces graph regularization into LRR. By taking full advantages of the graph regularization, LLRR method can capture the intrinsic non-linear geometric information among the data. The LLRR method can decomposes the observation matrix of genomic data into a low rank matrix and a sparse matrix through solving an optimization problem. Because the significant genes can be considered as sparse signals, the differentially expressed genes are viewed as the sparse perturbation signals. Therefore, the differentially expressed genes can be selected according to the sparse matrix. Finally, we use the GO tool to analyze the selected genes and compare the P-values with other methods.The results on the simulation data and two real genomic data illustrate that this method outperforms some other methods: in differentially expressed gene selection.",

     "abstract": "Gene-gene interaction (GGI) is one of the most popular approaches for finding the missing heritability of common complex traits in genetic association studies. The multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method has been widely studied for detecting GGIs. In order to identify the best interaction model associated with disease susceptibility, MDR compares all possible genotype combinations in terms of their predictability of disease status from a simple binary high(H) and low(L) risk classification. However, this simple binary classification does not reflect the uncertainty of H/L classification.We regard classifying H/L as equivalent to defining the degree of membership of two risk groups H/L. By adopting the fuzzy set theory, we propose Fuzzy MDR which takes into account the uncertainty of H/L classification. Fuzzy MDR allows the possibility of partial membership of H/L through a membership function which transforms the degree of uncertainty into a [0,1] scale. The best genotype combinations can be selected which maximizes a new fuzzy set based accuracy measure.Two simulation studies are conducted to compare the power of the proposed Fuzzy MDR with that of MDR. Our results show that Fuzzy MDR has higher power than MDR. We illustrate the proposed Fuzzy MDR by analysing bipolar disorder (BD) trait of the WTCCC dataset to detect GGI associated with BD.We propose a novel Fuzzy MDR method to detect gene–gene interaction by taking into account the uncertainly of H/L classification and show that it has higher power than MDR. Fuzzy MDR can be easily extended to handle continuous phenotypes as well. The program written in R for the proposed Fuzzy MDR is available at https://statgen.snu.ac.kr/software/FuzzyMDR.",

GO Consortium (GOC) resorts to various quality assurances to ensure the correctness of annotations. Due to resources limitations, only a small portion of annotations are manually added/checked by GO curators, and a large portion of available annotations are computationally inferred. While computationally inferred annotations provide greater coverage of known genes, they may also introduce annotation errors (noise) that could mislead the interpretation of the gene functions and their roles in cellular and biological processes. In this paper, we investigate how to identify noisy annotations, a rarely addressed problem, and propose a novel approach called NoisyGOA. NoisyGOA first measures taxonomic similarity between ontological terms using the GO hierarchy and semantic similarity between genes. Next, it leverages the taxonomic similarity and semantic similarity to predict noisy annotations. We compare NoisyGOA with other alternative methods on identifying noisy annotations under different simulated cases of noisy annotations, and on archived GO annotations. NoisyGOA achieved higher accuracy than other alternative methods in comparison. These results demonstrated both taxonomic similarity and semantic similarity contribute to the identification of noisy annotations.

     "abstract": "Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) belongs to a small group of the transcription factors that bind DNA only as a monomer. Three different approaches—Sitecon, SiteGA, and oPWM—constructed using the same training sample of experimentally confirmed SF-1 binding sites have been used to recognize these sites. The appropriate prediction thresholds for recognition models have been selected. Namely, the thresholds concordant by false positive or negative rates for various methods were used to optimize the discrimination of steroidogenic gene promoters from the datasets of non-specific promoters. After experimental verification, the models were used to analyze the ChIP-seq data for SF-1. It has been shown that the sets of sites recognized by different models overlap only partially and that an integration of these models allows for identification of SF-1 sites in up to 80% of the ChIP-seq loci. The structures of the sites detected using the three recognition models in the ChIP-seq peaks falling within the [–5000, +5000] region relative to the transcription start sites (TSS) extracted from the FANTOM5 project have been analyzed. The MATLIGN classified the frequency matrices for the sites predicted by oPWM, Sitecon, and SiteGA into two groups. The first group is described by oPWM/Sitecon and the second, by SiteGA. Gene ontology (GO) analysis has been used to clarify the differences between the sets of genes carrying different variants of SF-1 binding sites. Although this analysis in general revealed a considerable overlap in GO terms for the genes carrying the binding sites predicted by oPWM, Sitecon, or SiteGA, only the last method elicited notable trend to terms related to negative regulation and apoptosis. The results suggest that the SF-1 binding sites are different in both their structure and the functional annotation of the set of target genes correspond to the predictions by oPWM + Sitecon and SiteGA. Further application of Homer software for de novo identification of enriched motifs in ChIP-Seq data for SF-1ChIP-seq dataset gave the data similar to oPWM + Sitecon.",

     "abstract": "Actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in cancerous cell progression. Till date many anticancer toxins are discovered that binds to different sites of actin. Mechanism of action of these toxins varies with respect to the site where they bind to actin. Latrunculin A (LAT) binds closely to nucleotide binding site and Reidispongiolide binds to the barbed end of actin. LAT is reported to reduce the displacement of domain 2 with respect to domain 1 and allosterically modulate nucleotide exchange. On the other hand Reidispongiolide binds with the higher affinity to actin and competes with the DNaseI binding loop once the inter-monomer interaction has been formed. Evolving better actin binders being the aim of this study we conducted a comparative molecular dynamics of these two actin-drug complexes and actin complexed with ATP alone, 50 ns each. High throughput binding free energy calculations in conjugation with the high-throughput MD simulations was used to predict modifications in these two renowned anti-actin anticancer drugs for better design. Per residue energy profiling that contribute to free energy of binding shows that there is an unfavourable energy at the site where Asp157 interacts with 2-thiazolidinone moiety of LAT. Similarly, unfavourable energies are reported near macrocyclic region of Reidispongiolide specifically near carbons 7, 11 & 25 and tail region carbons 27 & 30. These predicted sites can be used for modifications and few of these are discussed in this work based on the interactions with the binding site residues. The study reveals specific interactions that are involved in the allosteric modulation of ATP by these two compounds. Glu207 closely interacting with LAT A initiates the allosteric effect on ATP binding site specifically affecting residues Asp184, Lys215 and Lys336. RGA bound actin shows high anti-correlated motions between sub domain 3 and 4. Unlike LAT A, Reidispongiolide induces a flat structure of actin which definitely should affect actin polymerisation and lead to disassembly of actin filaments.",

Due to NP-hardness, the exact algorithms fail to compute SCS for larger instances. Many heuristics and meta-heuristics approaches were proposed to solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a meta-heuristics approach based on chemical reaction optimization, CRO_SCS that is designed inspired by the nature of the chemical reactions. For different optimization problems like 0-1 knapsack, quadratic assignment, global numeric optimization problems CRO algorithm shows very good performance. We have redesigned the reaction operators and a new reform function to solve the SCS problem. The outcomes of the proposed CRO_SCS algorithm are compared with those of the enhanced beam search (IBS_SCS), deposition and reduction (DR), ant colony optimization (ACO) and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms. The length of supersequence, execution time and standard deviation of all related algorithms show that CRO_SCS gives better results on the average than all other algorithms.",

With the Hapmap SNP data, we empirically demonstrate that the preferential model is better for illustrating the clustered distribution of SNPs than the random model. Moreover, the model is applicable not only to autosomes but also to the X chromosome, although the X chromosome has different characteristics from autosomes. The analysis of the estimated parameters in the model can explain the pronounced population structure and the low genetic diversity of the X chromosome. In addition, correlation between the parameters reveals the population-wise difference of the mutation probability. These results support the mutational non-independence hypothesis against random mutation.",

The computational approach provides a sophisticated tool to design a functional peptide that may block the insulin receptor activity. The peptide that able to inhibit the binding between insulin and insulin receptor is a warrant for inducing T2DM. Therefore, we designed a potential peptide inhibitor of insulin receptor as an agent to generate T2DM animal model by bioinformatics approach. The peptide has been developed based on the structure of insulin receptor binding site of insulin and then modified it to obtain the best properties of half life, hydrophobicity, antigenicity, and stability binding into insulin receptor. The results showed that the modified peptide has characteristics 100 h half-life, high-affinity −95.1 ± 20, and high stability 28.17 in complex with the insulin receptor. Moreover, the modified peptide has molecular weight 4420.8 g/Mol and has no antigenic regions. Based on the molecular dynamic simulation, the complex of modified peptide-insulin receptor is more stable than the commercial insulin receptor blocker. This study suggested that the modified peptide has the promising performance to block the insulin receptor activity that potentially induce diabetes mellitus type 2 in mice.",

However, the gatekeeper mutation T790M in EGFR active site can confer generic resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), largely limiting the clinical applications of chemotherapeutic drugs in NSCLC. Here, a combined method of computational analysis and growth inhibition assay was described to systematically investigate the molecular response profile of wild-type–sparing and mutant-resistant inhibitors to the EGFR T790M mutation. The profile is highly consistent with previous clinical observations; three first-line chemotherapeutic drugs Gefitinib, Erlotinib and Lapatinib are established with acquired resistance upon the mutation. In addition, it was found that the alkaloid compound K252a, a Staurosporine analog isolated from Nocardiopisis sp., can selectively target the EGFR T790M mutant over wild-type kinase (23-fold selectivity), suggesting that the compound is good lead candidate for development of T790M mutant-selective inhibitors. Structural analysis revealed that the mutation-resulting Met790 residue does not induce steric hindrance to the EGFR T790M–K252a complex system, while a number of hydrophobic forces, van der Waals contacts and S⋯π interactions are observed between the aromatic rings of K252a and the sulfhydryl group of Met790, contributing considerable stabilization energy to the system.",

Modes of interaction of selected OXA variants with respective antibiotics were analyzed by Autodock4.0 and LIGPLOT. Comparative mobility profiling and subsequent ΔG° and Km calculations of representative OXA variants revealed that after RSBL evolution, perhaps, two competitive strategies evolved among the OXA variants. Either loops flanking helix5 gets stabilized or it becomes more flexible. Therefore, while OXA variants (e.g. OXA-2, OXA-32, OXA-23, OXA-133, OXA-24, OXA-25, OXA-51 and OXA-75) with highly stabilized loops flanking helix5 exhibited improved binding stability and affinity towards carbapenems, especially meropenem, OXA variants (e.g. OXA-10, OXA-251, OXA-48 and OXA-247) possessing highly flexibile loops flanking helix5 revealed their catalytic proficiency towards ceftazidime.

This intra-subunit selectivity arises from the unconserved residues at the 2’ sites, which are the essential molecular basis for both the binding and potency of picrotoxinin. The serine residues at the 2’ positions of the ρ2 channel are predicted to form multiple hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with picrotoxinin, whereas the proline residues in the 2’ positions of ρ1 channels are predicted to form only hydrophobic contacts with picrotoxinin.

The HLA II contains three allelic isotypes HLA-DR, -DQ, and -QP that exhibit considerably different susceptibility to AR. Here, we investigated the structural basis and energetic landscape of the susceptibility difference between the three HLA II isotypes to AR by combining computational analysis and experimental assay. Multiple sequence alignment revealed a low conservation among the three subtypes with sequence identity of ∼10% between them, suggesting that the peptide repertoires presented by HLA-DR, -DP and -DQ are not overlapped to each other, and they may be involved in different immune functions and dysfunctions. Structural analysis imparted that the antigenic peptides are rooted on the peptide-binding groove of HLA molecules and hold in a PPII-like helical conformation. Subsequently, the interaction behavior of 17 AR allergen-derived peptides with HLA-DR, −DP and −DQ was investigated using a statistics-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) predictor. It was found a significant difference between the binding capabilities of these antigenic peptides to HLA-DR and to HLA-DP/-DQ; the former showed a generally higher affinity than the latter with p-value of 0.02 obtained from 2-tailed Student’s t-test. The computational findings were then confirmed by HLA II–peptide stability assay, which demonstrated that the AR allergen-derived peptides have a high in vitro selectivity for HLA-DR over HLA-DP/-DQ. Thus, the HLA-DR isotype, rather than HLA-DP and −DQ, is expected to associate with the pathological process of AR.",

     "abstract": "Triticum aestivum L. known as common wheat is one of the most important cereal crops feeding a large and growing population. Various environmental stress factors including drought, high salinity and heat etc. adversely affect wheat production in a significant manner. Dehydration-responsive element-binding (DREB1A) factors, a class of transcription factors (TF) play an important role in combating drought stress. It is known that DREB1A specifically interacts with the dehydration responsive elements (DRE/CRT) inducing expression of genes involved in environmental stress tolerance in plants. Despite its critical interplay in plants, the structural and functional aspects of DREB1A TF in wheat remain unresolved. Previous studies showed that wheat DREBs (DREB1 and DREB2) were isolated using various methods including yeast two-hybrid screens but no extensive structural models were reported. In this study, we made an extensive in silico study to gain insight into DREB1A TF and reported the location of novel DREB1A in wheat chromosomes. We inferred the three-dimensional structural model of DREB1A using homology modelling and further evaluated them using molecular dynamics(MD) simulations yielding refined modelled structures. Our biochemical function predictions suggested that the wheat DREB1A orthologs have similar biochemical functions and pathways to that of AtDREB1A. In conclusion, the current study presents a structural perspective of wheat DREB1A and helps in understanding the molecular basis for the mechanism of DREB1A in response to environmental stress.",

     "abstract": "Various types of oxygenated fatty acids termed ‘oxylipins’ are involved in plant response to herbivory. Oxylipins like jasmonic acid (JA) and green leafy volatiles (GLVs) are formed by the action of enzymes like allene oxide synthase (AOS) and hydroxyperoxide lyase (HPL) respectively. In this study, we focus on AOS of Oryza sativa sb. Japonica, that interact with 9- and 13- hydroxyperoxides to produce intermediates of jasmonate pathway and compare it with rice HPL that yields GLVs. We attempt to elucidate the interaction pattern by computational docking protocols keeping the Arabidopsis AOS system as the reference model system. Both 9-hydroxyperoxide and 13-hydroxyperoxide fit into the active site of AOS completely with Phe347, Phe92, Ile463, Val345, and Asn278 being the common interacting residues. Phe347 and Phe92 were mutated with Leucine and docked again with the hydroxyperoxides. The Phe347 → Leu347 mutant showed a different mode of action than AOS-hydroxyperoxide complex with Trp413 in direct bonding with the OOH group of 9-hydroxyperoxide. The loss of Lys88-OOH interaction in 13-hydroxyperoxide and loss-of-interaction of Leu347 indicated the importance of Phe347 residue in hydroxyperoxide catalysis. The second mutant Phe92 → Leu92 also shows a very different interaction pattern with 13-hydroxyperoxide but not with 9-hydroxyperoxide.Therefore, it can be concluded that Phe347 is more crucial for AOS functionality than Phe92. The aromatic ring of a Phenylalanine residue is important for catalysis and its mutation affects the binding of the two ligands. Another important residue is Asn278 which is an important part of the AOS catalytic site for maintaining stability and can be compared with the Arabidopsis AOS residue Asn321. Lastly, the interaction of HPL with these two derivatives involves Leu363 residue instead of Phe347 and thus, validating the importance of Phe → Leu substitution to be the reason of different modes of action that result in completely different products from same substrates.",

     "abstract": "Glutathione-s-transferases (GSTs) are enzymes that principally catalyze the conjugation of electrophilic compounds to the endogenous nucleophilic glutathione substrate, besides, they have other non-catalytic functions. The Plasmodium falciparum genome encodes a single isoform of GST (PfGST) which is involved in buffering the toxic heme, thus considered a potential anti-malarial target. In mammals several classes of GSTs are available, each of various isoforms. The human (human GST Pi-1 or hGSTP1) and mouse (murine GST Mu-1 or mGSTM1) GST isoforms control cellular apoptosis by interaction with signaling proteins, thus considered as potential anti-cancer targets. In the course of GSTs inhibitors development, the models of ligands interactions with GSTs are used to guide rational molecular modification. In the absence of X-ray crystallographic data, enzyme kinetics and molecular docking experiments can aid in addressing ligands binding modes to the enzymes.Kinetic studies were used to investigate the interactions between the three GSTs and each of glutathione, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, cibacron blue, ethacrynic acid, S-hexyl glutathione, hemin and protoporphyrin IX. Since hemin displacement is intended for PfGST inhibitors, the interactions between hemin and other ligands at PfGST binding sites were studied kinetically. Computationally determined binding modes and energies were interlinked with the kinetic results to resolve enzymes-ligands interaction models at atomic level.The results showed that hemin and cibacron blue have different binding modes in the three GSTs. Hemin has two binding sites (A and B) with two binding modes at site-A depending on presence of GSH. None of the ligands were able to compete hemin binding to PfGST except ethacrynic acid. Besides bind differently in GSTs, the isolated anthraquinone moiety of cibacron blue is not maintaining sufficient interactions with GSTs to be used as a lead. Similarly, the ethacrynic acid uses water bridges to mediate interactions with GSTs and at least the conjugated form of EA is the true hemin inhibitor, thus EA may not be a suitable lead.Glutathione analogues with bulky substitution at thiol of cysteine moiety or at γ-amino group of γ-glutamine moiety may be the most suitable to provide GST inhibitors with hemin competition.",

     "abstract": "The differentiation of human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESCs) is accompanied by the formation of different intermediary cells, gradually losing its stemness and acquiring differentiation. The precise mechanisms underlying hESCs integrity and its differentiation into fibroblast (Fib) are still elusive. Here, we aimed to assess important genes and co-expression sub-networks responsible for stemness, early differentiation of hESCs into embryoid bodies (EBs) and its lineage specification into Fibs. To achieve this, we compared transcriptional profiles of hESCs-EBs and EBs-Fibs and obtained differentially expressed genes (DEGs) exclusive to hESCs-EBs (early differentiation), EBs-Fibs (late differentiation) and common DEGs in hESCs-EBs and EBs-Fibs. Then, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) followed by overrepresentation study and identified key genes for each gene category. The regulations of these genes were studied by integrating ChIP-Seq data of core transcription factors (TFs) and histone methylation marks in hESCs. Finally, we identified co-expression sub-networks from key genes of each gene category using k-clique sub-network extraction method. Our study predicted seven genes edicting core stemness properties forming a co-expression network. From the pathway analysis of sub-networks of hESCs-EBs, we hypothesize that FGF2 is contributing to pluripotent transcription network of hESCs in association with DNMT3B and JARID2 thereby facilitating cell proliferation. On the contrary, FGF2 is found to promote cell migration in Fibs along with DDR2, CAV1, DAB2, and PARVA. Moreover, our study identified three k-clique sub-networks regulating TGF-β signaling pathway thereby promoting EBs to Fibs differentiation by: (i) modulating extracellular matrix involving ITGB1, TGFB1I1 and GBP1, (ii) regulating cell cycle remodeling involving CDKN1A, JUNB and DUSP1 and (iii) helping in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) involving THBS1, INHBA and LOX. This study put forward the unexplored genes and co-expression sub-networks regulating stemness and different stages of differentiation of hESCs which will undoubtedly add to the comprehensive understanding of hESCs biology.",

According to observations that diseases with the same or similar phenotype have the same biological characteristics, researchers have tried to identify genes by using machine learning tools. In recent attempts, some semi-supervised learning methods, called positive-unlabeled learning, is used for disease gene identification. In this paper, we present a Perceptron ensemble of graph-based positive-unlabeled learning (PEGPUL) on three types of biological attributes: gene ontologies, protein domains and protein-protein interaction networks. In our method, a reliable set of positive and negative genes are extracted using co-training schema. Then, the similarity graph of genes is built using metric learning by concentrating on multi-rank-walk method to perform inference from labeled genes. At last, a Perceptron ensemble is learned from three weighted classifiers: multilevel support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor and decision tree. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) incorporating the statistical properties of gene data through choosing proper metrics, (ii) statistical evaluation of biological features, and (iii) noise robustness characteristic of PEGPUL via using multilevel schema. In order to assess PEGPUL, we have applied it on 12950 disease genes with 949 positive genes from six class of diseases and 12001 unlabeled genes. Compared with some popular disease gene identification methods, the experimental results show that PEGPUL has reasonable performance.",

By modernization of live and the growing industrial revolution in camels rearing areas, camels are exposed to considerable amount of chemicals, industrial waste, environmental pollutions and drugs. Furthermore, camels have unique gene evolution of some genes to withstand living in harsh environments. In this work, the camel cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is compromised to detect its evolution rate and its power to bind with various chemicals, protoxins, procarcinogens, industrial toxins and drugs. In comparison with human CYP2E1, camel CYP2E1 more efficiently binds to small toxins as aniline, benzene, catechol, amides, butadiene, toluene and acrylamide. Larger compounds were more preferentially bound to the human CYP2E1 in comparison with camel CYP2E1. The binding of inhalant anesthetics was almost similar in both camel and human CYP2E1 coinciding with similar anesthetic effect as well as toxicity profiles. Furthermore, evolutionary analysis indicated the high evolution rate of camel CYP2E1 in comparison with human, farm and companion animals. The evolution rate of camel CYP2E1 was among the highest evolution rate in a subset of 57 different organisms. These results indicate rapid evolution and potent toxin binding power of camel CYP2E1.",

A “currants-in-jelly” model is developed that provides a flexible approach in which the contribution of the soft high-level objects (jelly-like) are employed to protect the underlying atomic structure (currants), while still allowing them to interact. Idealised chains were used to establish the parameters to achieve this degree of interaction over a hierarchy spanning four levels and in a more realistic example, the distortion experienced by a protein domain structure during collision was measured and the parameters refined. This model of steric repulsion was then combined with sets of predicted distance constraints, derived from correlated mutation analysis. Firstly, an integral trans-membrane protein was modelled in which the packing of the seven helices was refined but without topological rearrangement. Secondly, an RNA structure was ‘folded’ under the predicted constraints, starting only from its 2-dimensional secondary structure prediction.",

Proper glycosylation of α-DG is mediated by the glycosylating enzyme LARGE.

The gene regulatory networks (GRNs) help in the identification of regulatory interactions between genes and offer fruitful information related to functional role of individual gene in a cellular system. Discovering GRNs lead to a wide range of applications, including identification of disease related pathways providing novel tentative drug targets, helps to predict disease response, and also assists in diagnosing various diseases including cancer. Reconstruction of GRNs from available biological data is still an open problem. This paper proposes a recurrent neural network (RNN) based model of GRN, hybridized with generalized extended Kalman filter for weight update in backpropagation through time training algorithm. The RNN is a complex neural network that gives a better settlement between biological closeness and mathematical flexibility to model GRN; and is also able to capture complex, non-linear and dynamic relationships among variables. Gene expression data are inherently noisy and Kalman filter performs well for estimation problem even in noisy data. Hence, we applied non-linear version of Kalman filter, known as generalized extended Kalman filter, for weight update during RNN training. The developed model has been tested on four benchmark networks such as DNA SOS repair network, IRMA network, and two synthetic networks from DREAM Challenge. We performed a comparison of our results with other state-of-the-art techniques which shows superiority of our proposed model. Further, 5% Gaussian noise has been induced in the dataset and result of the proposed model shows negligible effect of noise on results, demonstrating the noise tolerance capability of the model.",

The cumulative mortality reaches up to 100% within in 2–10 days in a shrimp farm. Currently, no chemotherapeutics are available to control WSSV. The viral envelope protein, VP28, located on the surface of the virus particle acts as a vital virulence factor in the initial phases of inherent WSSV infection in shrimp. Hence, inhibition of envelope protein VP28 could be a novel way to deal with infection by inhibiting its interaction in the endocytic pathway. In this direction, a timely attempt was made to recognize a potential drug candidate of marine origin against WSSV using VP28 as a target by employing in silico docking and molecular dynamic simulations. A virtual library of 388 marine bioactive compounds was extracted from reports published in Marine Drugs. The top ranking compounds from docking studies were chosen from the flexible docking based on the binding affinities (ΔGb). In addition, the MD simulation and binding free energy analysis were implemented to validate and capture intermolecular interactions. The results suggested that the two compounds obtained a negative binding free energy with −40.453 kJ/mol and −31.031 kJ/mol for compounds with IDs 30797199 and 144162 respectively. The RMSD curve indicated that 30797199 moves into the hydrophobic core, while the position of 144162 atoms changes abruptly during simulation and is mostly stabilized by water bridges. The shift in RMSD values of VP28 corresponding to ligand RMSD gives an insight into the ligand induced conformational changes in the protein.

In this study, we evaluated a contribution of the respective complementarity determining region (CDR) loops on the antibody recognition of antigen by performing molecular dynamics simulations for 20 kinds of antigen-antibody complexes. Ser and Tyr showed high appearance rates at CDR loops and the sum of averaged appearance rates of Ser and Tyr was about 20⿿30% at all the loops. For example, Ser and Tyr occupied 23.9% at the light chain first loop (L1) and 23.6% at the heavy chain third loop (H3). The direct hydrogen bonds between antigen and antibody were not equally distributed over heavy and light chains. That is, about 70% of the hydrogen bonds were observed at CDRs of the heavy chain and also the direct hydrogen bond with the shortest distance mainly existed at the loops of the heavy chain for all the complexes. It was revealed from the comparison in contribution to the binding free energy among CDR loops that the heavy chain (especially at H2 and H3) had significant influence on the binding between antigen and antibody because three CDR loops of the heavy chain showed the lowest binding free energy (οGbind) in 19 complexes out of 20. Tyr in heavy chain (especially in H2 and H3) largely contributed to οGbind whereas Ser hardly contributed to οGbind even if the number of the direct hydrogen bond with Ser was the fourth largest and also the appearance rate at CDR was the highest among 20 kinds of amino acid residues. The contributions ofTrp and Phe, which bear aromatic ring in the side chain, were often observed in the heavy chain although the energetic contribution of these residues was not so high as Tyr. The present computational analysis suggests that Tyr plays an outstanding role for the antigen-antibody interaction and the CDR loops of the heavy chain is critically important for antibody recognition of antigen.",

     "abstract": "In many sequence data mining applications, the goal is to find frequent substrings. Some of these applications like extracting motifs in protein and DNA sequences are looking for frequently occurring approximate contiguous substrings called simple motifs. By approximate we mean that some mismatches are allowed during similarity test between substrings, and it helps to discover unknown patterns. Structured motifs in DNA sequences are frequent structured contiguous substrings which contains two or more simple motifs. There are some works that have been done to find simple motifs but these works have problems such as low scalability, high execution time, no guarantee to find all patterns, and low flexibility in adaptation to other application. The Flame is the only algorithm that can find all unknown structured patterns in a dataset and has solved most of these problems but its scalability for very large sequences is still weak.

This data structure makes change in how to find patterns by NSAMD in comparison with Flame and helps to find structured motif faster. Proposed algorithm is as accurate as Flame and extracts all existing patterns in dataset. Performance comparisons show that NSAMD outperforms Flame in extracting structured motifs in both execution time (51% faster) and memory usage (more than 99%). Proposed algorithm is slower in extracting simple motifs but considerable improvement in memory usage (more than 99%) makes NSAMD more scalable than Flame. This advantage of NSAMD is very important in biological applications in which very large sequences are applied.",

Studies on hCCT and its interactome acquire an additional dimension, as it has been implicated in several disease conditions like neurodegeneration and cancer. We attempt to study its stress response role in general, which will be reflected in the aspects of human diseases and yeast physiology, through computational analysis of the interactome. Towards consolidating and analysing the interactome data, we prepared and compared the unique CCT-interacting protein lists for S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens, performed GO term classification and enrichment studies which provide information on the diversity in CCT interactome, in terms of protein classes in the data set. Enrichment with disease-associated proteins and pathways highlight the medical importance of CCT. Different analyses converge, suggesting the significance of WD-repeat proteins, protein kinases and cytoskeletal proteins in the interactome. The prevalence of proteasomal subunits and ribosomal proteins suggest a possible cross-talk between protein-synthesis, folding and degradation machinery. A network of chaperones and chaperonins that function in combination can also be envisaged from the CCT interactome-Hsp70 interactome analysis.",

The commonly used root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) is not only ligand-size dependent, but also may fail to capture biologically meaningful binding features. To address these issues, we developed the Contact Mode Score (CMS), a new metric to assess the conformational similarity based on intermolecular protein-ligand contacts. The CMS is less dependent on the ligand size and has the ability to include flexible receptors. In order to effectively compare binding poses of non-identical ligands bound to different proteins, we further developed the eXtended Contact Mode Score (XCMS).

     "abstract": "Ovarian carcinoma is the fifth-leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. Major reasons for this persistent mortality include the poor understanding of the underlying biology and a lack of reliable biomarkers. Previous studies have shown that aberrantly expressed MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in carcinogenesis and tumor progression by post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression. However, the interference of miRNAs in tumorigenesis is quite complicated and far from being fully understood. In this work, by an integrative analysis of mRNA expression, miRNA expression and clinical data published by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we studied the modularity and dynamicity of miRNA–mRNA interactions and the prognostic implications in high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas. With the top transcriptional correlations (Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 0.01) as inputs, we identified five miRNA–mRNA module pairs (MPs), each of which included one positive-connection (correlation) module and one negative-connection (correlation) module. The number of miRNAs or mRNAs in each module varied from 3 to 7 or from 2 to 873. Among the four major negative-connection modules, three fit well with the widely accepted miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation theory. These modules were enriched with the genes relevant to cell cycle and immune response. Moreover, we proposed two novel algorithms to reveal the group or sample specific dynamic regulations between these two RNA classes. The obtained miRNA–mRNA dynamic network contains 3350 interactions captured across different cancer progression stages or tumor grades. We found that those dynamic interactions tended to concentrate on a few miRNAs (e.g. miRNA-936), and were more likely present on the miRNA–mRNA pairs outside the discovered modules. In addition, we also pinpointed a robust prognostic signature consisting of 56 modular protein-coding genes, whose co-expression patterns were predictive for the survival time of ovarian cancer patients in multiple independent cohorts.",

     "abstract": "Variations in DNA copy number carry important information on genome evolution and regulation of DNA replication in cancer cells. The rapid development of single-cell sequencing technology allows one to explore gene expression heterogeneity among single-cells, thus providing important cancer cell evolution information. Single-cell DNA/RNA sequencing data usually have low genome coverage, which requires an extra step of amplification to accumulate enough samples. However, such amplification will introduce large bias and makes bioinformatics analysis challenging. Accurately modeling the distribution of sequencing data and effectively suppressing the bias influence is the key to success variations analysis.Recent advances demonstrate the technical noises by amplification are more likely to follow negative binomial distribution, a special case of Poisson distribution. Thus, we tackle the problem CNV detection by formulating it into a quadratic optimization problem involving two constraints, in which the underling signals are corrupted by Poisson distributed noises. By imposing the constraints of sparsity and smoothness, the reconstructed read depth signals from single-cell sequencing data are anticipated to fit the CNVs patterns more accurately. An efficient numerical solution based on the classical alternating direction minimization method (ADMM) is tailored to solve the proposed model. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method using both synthetic and empirical single-cell sequencing data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves excellent performance and high promise of success with single-cell sequencing data.",

     "abstract": "In mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics, protein quantification and protein identification are two major computational problems. To quantify the protein abundance, a list of proteins must be firstly inferred from the raw data. Then the relative or absolute protein abundance is estimated with quantification methods, such as spectral counting. Until now, most researchers have been dealing with these two processes separately. In fact, the protein inference problem can be regarded as a special protein quantification problem in the sense that truly present proteins are those proteins whose abundance values are not zero. Some recent published papers have conceptually discussed this possibility. However, there is still a lack of rigorous experimental studies to test this hypothesis.In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using protein quantification methods to solve the protein inference problem. Protein inference methods aim to determine whether each candidate protein is present in the sample or not. Protein quantification methods estimate the abundance value of each inferred protein. Naturally, the abundance value of an absent protein should be zero. Thus, we argue that the protein inference problem can be viewed as a special protein quantification problem in which one protein is considered to be present if its abundance is not zero. Based on this idea, our paper tries to use three simple protein quantification methods to solve the protein inference problem effectively. The experimental results on six data sets show that these three methods are competitive with previous protein inference algorithms. This demonstrates that it is plausible to model the protein inference problem as a special protein quantification task, which opens the door of devising more effective protein inference algorithms from a quantification perspective.

     "abstract": "Multi-instance multi-label (MIML) learning has been proven to be effective for the genome-wide protein function prediction problems where each training example is associated with not only multiple instances but also multiple class labels. To find an appropriate MIML learning method for genome-wide protein function prediction, many studies in the literature attempted to optimize objective functions in which dissimilarity between instances is measured using the Euclidean distance. But in many real applications, Euclidean distance may be unable to capture the intrinsic similarity/dissimilarity in feature space and label space. Unlike other previous approaches, in this paper, we propose to learn a multi-instance multi-label distance metric learning framework (MIMLDML) for genome-wide protein function prediction. Specifically, we learn a Mahalanobis distance to preserve and utilize the intrinsic geometric information of both feature space and label space for MIML learning. In addition, we try to deal with the sparsely labeled data by giving weight to the labeled data. Extensive experiments on seven real-world organisms covering the biological three-domain system (i.e., archaea, bacteria, and eukaryote; Woese et al., 1990) show that the MIMLDML algorithm is superior to most state-of-the-art MIML learning algorithms.",

However, OptNetAlign is an unsupervised genetic algorithm that initiates its search with completely random solutions and it requires substantial running times to generate an elite set of solutions that have high scores with respect to the given criteria. In order to improve running time, the search space of the algorithm can be narrowed down by focusing on remarkably qualified alignments and trying to optimize the most desired criteria on a more limited set of solutions. The method presented in this study improves OptNetAlign in a supervised fashion by utilizing the alignment results of different network alignment algorithms with varying parameters that depend upon user preferences.

     "abstract": "As a key mechanism of gene regulation, transcription factors (TFs) bind to DNA by recognizing specific short sequence patterns that are called DNA-binding motifs. A single TF can accept ambiguity within its DNA-binding motifs, which comprise both canonical (typical) and non-canonical motifs. Clarification of such DNA-binding motif ambiguity is crucial for revealing gene regulatory networks and evaluating mutations in cis-regulatory elements. Although chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) now provides abundant data on the genomic sequences to which a given TF binds, existing motif discovery methods are unable to directly answer whether a given TF can bind to a specific DNA-binding motif.Here, we report a method for clarifying the DNA-binding motif ambiguity, MOCCS. Given ChIP-Seq data of any TF, MOCCS comprehensively analyzes and describes every k-mer to which that TF binds. Analysis of simulated datasets revealed that MOCCS is applicable to various ChIP-Seq datasets, requiring only a few minutes per dataset. Application to the ENCODE ChIP-Seq datasets proved that MOCCS directly evaluates whether a given TF binds to each DNA-binding motif, even if known position weight matrix models do not provide sufficient information on DNA-binding motif ambiguity. Furthermore, users are not required to provide numerous parameters or background genomic sequence models that are typically unavailable. MOCCS is implemented in Perl and R and is freely available via https://github.com/yuifu/moccs.By complementing existing motif-discovery software, MOCCS will contribute to the basic understanding of how the genome controls diverse cellular processes via DNA–protein interactions.",

In recent years, network approaches have been applied to such data in uncovering the complex interrelationships between mutational and expression profiles, but lack direct testing for expression changes via mutation. In this pan-cancer study we analyze mutation and gene expression information in an integrative manner by considering the networks generated by testing for differences in expression in direct association with specific mutations. We relate our findings among the 19 cancers examined to identify commonalities and differences as well as their characteristics.Using somatic mutation and gene expression information across 19 cancers, we generated mutation–expression networks per cancer. On evaluation we found that our generated networks were significantly enriched for known cancer-related genes, such as skin cutaneous melanoma (p < 0.01 using Network of Cancer Genes 4.0). Our framework identified that while different cancers contained commonly mutated genes, there was little concordance between associated gene expression changes among cancers. Comparison between cancers showed a greater overlap of network nodes for cancers with higher overall non-silent mutation load, compared to those with a lower overall non-silent mutation load.This study offers a framework that explores network information through co-analysis of somatic mutations and gene expression profiles. Our pan-cancer application of this approach suggests that while mutations are frequently common among cancer types, the impact they have on the surrounding networks via gene expression changes varies. Despite this finding, there are some cancers for which mutation-associated network behaviour appears to be similar: suggesting a potential framework for uncovering related cancers for which similar therapeutic strategies may be applicable. Our framework for understanding relationships among cancers has been integrated into an interactive R Shiny application, PAn Cancer Mutation Expression Networks (PACMEN), containing dynamic and static network visualization of the mutation–expression networks.

     "abstract": "The statistical tests for single locus disease association are mostly under-powered. If a disease associated causal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) operates essentially through a complex mechanism that involves multiple SNPs or possible environmental factors, its effect might be missed if the causal SNP is studied in isolation without accounting for these unknown genetic influences. In this study, we attempt to address the issue of reduced power that is inherent in single point association studies by accounting for genetic influences that negatively impact the detection of causal variant in single point association analysis. In our method we use propensity score (PS) to adjust for the effect of SNPs that influence the marginal association of a candidate marker. These SNPs might be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and/or epistatic with the target-SNP and have a joint interactive influence on the disease under study. We therefore propose a propensity score adjustment method (PSAM) as a tool for dimension reduction to improve the power for single locus studies through an estimated PS to adjust for influence from these SNPs while regressing disease status on the target-genetic locus. The degree of freedom of such a test is therefore always restricted to 1.We assess PSAM under the null hypothesis of no disease association to affirm that it correctly controls for the type-I-error rate (<0.05). PSAM displays reasonable power (>70%) and shows an average of 15% improvement in power as compared with commonly-used logistic regression method and PLINK under most simulated scenarios. Using the open-access multifactor dimensionality reduction dataset, PSAM displays improved significance for all disease loci. Through a whole genome study, PSAM was able to identify 21 SNPs from the GAW16 NARAC dataset by reducing their original trend-test p-values from within 0.001 and 0.05 to p-values less than 0.0009, and among which 6 SNPs were further found to be associated with immunity and inflammation.PSAM improves the significance of single-locus association of causal SNPs which have had marginal single point association by adjusting for influence from other SNPs in a dataset. This would explain part of the missing heritability without increasing the complexity of the model due to huge multiple testing scenarios. The newly reported SNPs from GAW16 data would provide evidences for further research to elucidate the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis.

Polymorphisms among these alleles (Asp116Tyr and Asp156Leu) result in major differences in the allele characteristics. While HLA-B*44:02 (Asp116, Asp156) and HLA-B*44:03 (Asp116, Leu156) depend on tapasin for efficient peptide loading, HLA-B*44:05 (Tyr116, Asp156) is tapasin independent.

We found that human pathological mutations tend to lay in regions of low diversity and that states that are pathological in humans appear to be extremely rare in animals, with two noticeable exceptions (T10663C and C14568T). Focusing on hydrophobicity, as possibly the most general site-wise functional parameter of a protein, we deploy the observed range of hydrophobicity in mammals as a proxy for the range of permissible states compatible with an efficient functioning of the mitochondrial machinery. We show that, while non pathological human variants tend to fall within the hypothesized range, pathological mutations generally fall outside this range. We further analyzed this distribution quantitatively to show that the estimated probability of observed states can indeed be used to predict the pathogenicity of a mutation in humans. This study provides a proof of principle that animal data can indeed be informative to predict the pathogenicity of a human mutation alongside, or in the absence of, additional evidence.",

     "abstract": "The coactivators CBP (CREBBP) and its paralog p300 (EP300), two conserved multi-domain proteins in eukaryotic organisms, regulate gene expression in part by binding DNA-binding transcription factors. It was previously reported that the CBP/p300 KIX domain mutant (Y650A, A654Q, and Y658A) altered both c-Myb-dependent gene activation and repression, and that mice with these three point mutations had reduced numbers of platelets, B cells, T cells, and red blood cells. Here, our transient transfection assays demonstrated that mouse embryonic fibroblast cells containing the same mutations in the KIX domain and without a wild-type allele of either CBP or p300, showed decreased c-Myb-mediated transcription. Dr. Wright’s group solved a 3-D structure of the mouse CBP:c-Myb complex using NMR. To take advantage of the experimental structure and function data and improved theoretical calculation methods, we performed MD simulations of CBP KIX, CBP KIX with the mutations, and c-Myb, as well as binding energy analysis for both the wild-type and mutant complexes. The binding between CBP and c-Myb is mainly mediated by a shallow hydrophobic groove in the center where the side-chain of Leu302 of c-Myb plays an essential role and two salt bridges at the two ends. We found that the KIX mutations slightly decreased stability of the CBP:c-Myb complex as demonstrated by higher binding energy calculated using either MM/PBSA or MM/GBSA methods. More specifically, the KIX mutations affected the two salt bridges between CBP and c-Myb (CBP-R646 and c-Myb-E306; CBP-E665 and c-Myb-R294). Our studies also revealed differing dynamics of the hydrogen bonds between CBP-R646 and c-Myb-E306 and between CBP-E665 and c-Myb-R294 caused by the CBP KIX mutations. In the wild-type CBP:c-Myb complex, both of the hydrogen bonds stayed relatively stable. In contrast, in the mutant CBP:c-Myb complex, hydrogen bonds between R646 and E306 showed an increasing trend followed by a decreasing trend, and hydrogen bonds of the E665:R294 pair exhibited a fast decreasing trend over time during MD simulations. In addition, our data showed that the KIX mutations attenuate CBP’s hydrophobic interaction with Leu302 of c-Myb. Furthermore, our 500-ns MD simulations showed that CBP KIX with the mutations has a slightly lower potential energy than wild-type CBP. The CBP KIX structures with or without its interacting protein c-Myb are different for both wild-type and mutant CBP KIX, and this is likewise the case for c-Myb with or without CBP, suggesting that the presence of an interacting protein influences the structure of a protein. Taken together, these analyses will improve our understanding of the exact functions of CBP and its interaction with c-Myb.",

     "abstract": "Apoptosis is described as a mechanism of cell death occurring after adequate cellular harm. Deregulation of apoptosis occurs in many human conditions such as autoimmune disorders, ischemic damage, neurodegenerative diseases and different cancer types. Information relating miRNAs to cancer is increasing. miRNAs can affect development of cancer via many different pathways, including apoptosis. Polymorphisms in miRNA genes or miRNA target sites (miRSNPs) can change miRNA activity. Although polymorphisms in miRNA genes are very uncommon, SNPs in miRNA-binding sites of target genes are quite common. Many researches have revealed that SNPs in miRNA target sites improve or decrease the efficacy of the interaction between miRNAs and their target genes. Our aim was to specify miRSNPs on CASP3 gene (caspase-3) and SNPs in miRNA genes targeting 5′UTR and coding exons of CASP3, and evaluate the effect of these miRSNPs and SNPs of miRNA genes with respect to apoptosis. We detected 141 different miRNA binding sites (126 different miRNAs) and 7 different SNPs in binding sites of miRNA in 5′UTR and CDS of CASP3 gene. Intriguingly, miR-339-3p’s binding site on CASP3 has a SNP (rs35372903, G/A) on CASP3 5′UTR and its genomic sequence has a SNP (rs565188493, G/A) at the same nucleotide with rs35372903. Also, miR-339-3p has two other SNPs (rs373011663, C/T rs72631820, A/G) of which the first is positioned at the binding site. Here, miRSNP (rs35372903) at CASP3 5′UTR and SNP (rs565188493) at miR-339-3p genomic sequence cross-matches at the same site of binding region. Besides, miR-339-3p targets many apoptosis related genes (ZNF346, TAOK2, PIM2, HIP1, BBC3, TNFRSF25, CLCF1, IHPK2, NOL3) although it had no apoptosis related interaction proven before. This means that miR-339-3p may also have a critical effect on apoptosis via different pathways other than caspase-3. Hence, we can deduce that this is the first study demonstrating a powerful association between miR-339-3p and apoptosis upon computational analysis.",

Apomictic plants form viable diploid female gametes without meiosis (apomeiosis) and produce embryos without fertilization (parthenogenesis). Apomeiosis, as a major component of apomixis, has recently been reported in some Arabidopsis thaliana mutants; dyad mutants of SWI1 showed developmental processes common to apomeiosis, such as producing functional diploid gametes. However, the orthologs of SWI1 genes in natural apomicts has not been previously reported. To identify the relationship between the SWI1 gene and the apomeiosis process, we isolated and sequenced SWI1 orthologs from Boechera species, including apomictic and sexual species. Boechera species are close relatives of A. thaliana and thus are advantageous model species for apomixis research. The SWI1 cDNAs were obtained by RT-PCR from apomictic and sexual Boechera young flower buds. We sequenced partial SWI1 transcripts that were 650 bp for B. holboellii and 684 bp for B. stricta. These SWI1-like sequences showed 86% similarity for B. holboellii and 92% for B. stricta to the A. thaliana SWI1 transcript. We also used available genome data and amplified genomic sequences for SWI1 orthologs in B. holboellii and B. stricta. The predicted proteins contain a phospholipase C domain and a nuclear localization signal. Sequence analysis did not show significant mutations related to apomixis, and phylogenetic analysis showed that SWI1-like sequences were common across plant families, regardless of the presence of a sexual or apomictic reproduction system. We also investigated the expression levels of SWI1 mRNA in the B. holboellii and B. stricta young unopened flower buds and found that relatively high levels of expression occurred in apomicts.",

     "abstract": "Cholera continues to be a major global health concern. Among different Vibrio cholerae strains, only O1 and O139 cause acute diarrheal diseases that are related to epidemic and pandemic outbreaks. The currently available cholera vaccines are mainly lived and attenuated vaccines consisting of V. cholerae virulence factors such as toxin-coregulated pili (TCP), outer membrane proteins (Omps), and nontoxic cholera toxin B subunit (CTB). Nowadays, there is a great interest in designing an efficient epitope vaccine against cholera. Epitope vaccines consisting of immunodominant epitopes and adjuvant molecules enhance the possibility of inciting potent protective immunity. In this study, V. cholerae protective antigens (OmpW, OmpU, TcpA and TcpF) and the CTB, which is broadly used as an immunostimulatory adjuvant, were analyzed using different bioinformatics and immunoinformatics tools. The common regions between promiscuous epitopes, binding to various HLA-II supertype alleles, and B-cell epitopes were defined based upon the aforementioned protective antigens. The ultimately selected epitopes and CTB adjuvant were fused together using proper GPGPG linkers to enhance vaccine immunogenicity. A three-dimensional model of the thus constructed vaccine was generated using I-TASSER. The model was structurally validated using the ProSA-web error-detection software and the Ramachandran plot. The validation results indicated that the initial 3D model needed refinement. Subsequently, a high-quality model obtained after various refinement cycles was used for defining conformational B-cell epitopes. Several linear and conformational B-cell epitopes were determined within the epitope vaccine, suggesting likely antibody triggering features of our designed vaccine. Next, molecular docking was performed between the 3D vaccine model and the tertiary structure of the toll like receptor 2 (TLR2). To gain further insight into the interaction between vaccine and TLR2, molecular dynamics simulation was performed, corroborating stable vaccine-TLR2 binding. In sum, the results suggest that our designed epitope vaccine could incite robust long-term protective immunity against V. cholera.",

However, a genome-wide search for rSNPs has not been properly addressed so far. In this work, a computational method for rSNP identification is proposed. As background SNPs far outnumber rSNPs, an ensemble method is applied to handle imbalanced data, which firstly converts an unbalanced dataset into several balanced ones and then models for every balanced dataset. Two major types of features are extracted, that are sequence based features and allele-specific based features. Then random forest is applied to build the recognition model for each balanced dataset. Finally, ensemble strategies are adopted to combine the result of each model together. We have tested our method on a set of experimentally verified rSNPs, and leave-one-out cross-validation results showed that our method can achieve accuracy with sensitivity of 73.8%, specificity of 71.8% and the area under ROC curve (AUC) is 0.756. In addition, our method is threshold free and doesn’t rely on data of regulatory elements, thus it will have better adaptability when facing different data scenarios.

Until recently, their mitogenomes seemed containing only one tRNA gene (trnMet), but a recent study found in two chaetognath mitogenomes two and four tRNA genes. Moreover, apparently two conspecific mitogenomes have different tRNA gene numbers (one and two). Reanalyses by tRNAscan-SE and ARWEN softwares of the five available complete chaetognath mitogenomes suggest numerous additional tRNA genes from different types. Their total number never reaches the 22 found in most other invertebrates using that genetic code. Predicted error compensation between codon-anticodon mismatch and tRNA misacylation suggests translational activity by tRNAs predicted solely according to secondary structure for tRNAs predicted by tRNAscan-SE, not ARWEN. Numbers of predicted stop-suppressor (antitermination) tRNAs coevolve with predicted overlapping, frameshifted protein coding genes including stop codons. Sequence alignments in secondary structure prediction with non-chaetognath tRNAs suggest that the most likely functional tRNAs are in intergenic regions, as regular mt-tRNAs. Due to usually short intergenic regions, generally tRNA sequences partially overlap with flanking genes. Some tRNA pairs seem templated by sense-antisense strands. Moreover, 16S rRNA genes, but not 12S rRNAs, appear as tRNA nurseries, as previously suggested for multifunctional ribosomal-like protogenomes.",

The re-optimization of the weights for the scoring function results in a similar docking performance with regard to docking power towards a cross docking test set. A ligand decoy based benchmark indicates a better discrimination between poses with high and low RMSD.

Increased understanding as well as advancements in the therapeutic aspect seems suboptimal to restrict the huge deaths associated with cancer. The major cause responsible for this is high resistance as well as relapse rate associated with cancers. Several evidences indicated that cancer stem cells (CSC) are mainly responsible for the resistance and relapses associated with cancer. Furthermore, agents targeting a single protein seem to have higher chances of resistance than multitargeting drugs. According to the concept of network model, partial inhibition of multiple targets is more productive than single hit agents. Thus, by fusing both the premises that CSC and single hit anticancer drugs, both are responsible for cancer related resistances and screened alkaloids for the search of leads having CSC targeting ability as well as the capability to modulating multiple target proteins. The in silico experimental data indicated that emetine and cortistatin have the ability to modulate hedgehog (Hh) pathway by binding to sonic hedgehog (Hh), smoothened (Smo) and Gli protein, involved in maintenance CSCs. Furthermore, solamargine, solasonine and tylophorine are also seems to be good lead molecules targeting towards CSCs by modulating Hh pathway. Except solamargine and solasonine, other best lead molecules also showed acceptable in silico ADME profile.

Here, we described a systematic protocol that combined computational modeling and experimental assay to discover novel peptide hydroxamate derivatives as potent and selective inhibitors for ADAM17 over ADAM10. In the procedure, a virtual combinatorial library of peptide hydroxamate compounds was generated by exploiting intermolecular interactions involved in crystal and modeled structures. The library was examined in detail to identify few promising candidates with both high affinity to ADAM17 and low affinity to ADAM10, which were then tested in vitro with enzyme inhibition assay. Consequently, two peptide hydroxamates Hxm-Phe-Ser-Asn and Hxm-Phe-Arg-Gln were found to exhibit potent inhibition against ADAM17 (Ki = 92 and 47 nM, respectively) and strong selectivity for ADAM17 over ADAM10 (∼7-fold and ∼5-fold, S = 0.86 and 0.71, respectively). The structural basis and energetic property of ADAM17 and ADAM10 interactions with the designed inhibitors were also investigated systematically. It is found that the exquisite network of nonbonded interactions involving the side chains of peptide hydroxamates is primarily responsible for inhibitor selectivity, while the coordination interactions and hydrogen bonds formed by the hydroxamate moiety and backbone of peptide hydroxamates confer high affinity to inhibitor binding.",

     "abstract": "Parameter estimation for models with intrinsic stochasticity poses specific challenges that do not exist for deterministic models. Therefore, specialized numerical methods for parameter estimation in stochastic models have been developed. Here, we study whether dedicated algorithms for stochastic models are indeed superior to the naive approach of applying the readily available least squares algorithm designed for deterministic models.We compare the performance of the recently developed multiple shooting for stochastic systems (MSS) method designed for parameter estimation in stochastic models, a stochastic differential equations based Bayesian approach and a chemical master equation based techniques with the least squares approach for parameter estimation in models of ordinary differential equations (ODE). As test data, 1000 realizations of the stochastic models are simulated. For each realization an estimation is performed with each method, resulting in 1000 estimates for each approach. These are compared with respect to their deviation to the true parameter and, for the genetic toggle switch, also their ability to reproduce the symmetry of the switching behavior. Results are shown for different set of parameter values of a genetic toggle switch leading to symmetric and asymmetric switching behavior as well as an immigration-death and a susceptible-infected-recovered model. This comparison shows that it is important to choose a parameter estimation technique that can treat intrinsic stochasticity and that the specific choice of this algorithm shows only minor performance differences.",

A given element from an oligonucleotide library is or is not a part of the target sequence. However, the DNA chip technology has been developed and it enables to receive a partial information about multiplicity of each oligonucleotide the analyzed sequence consist of. Currently, it is not possible to assess the exact data of such type but even partial information should be very useful.Two realistic multiplicity information models are taken into consideration in this paper. The first one, called “one and many” assumes that it is possible to obtain information if a given oligonucleotide occurs in a reconstructed sequence once or more than once. According to the second model, called “one, two and many”, one is able to receive from biochemical experiment information if a given oligonucleotide is present in an analyzed sequence once, twice or at least three times.An ant colony optimization algorithm has been implemented to verify the above models and to compare with existing algorithms for sequencing by hybridization which utilize the additional information. The proposed algorithm solves the problem with any kind of hybridization errors. Computational experiment results confirm that using even the partial information about multiplicity leads to increased quality of reconstructed sequences. Moreover, they also show that the more precise model enables to obtain better solutions and the ant colony optimization algorithm outperforms the existing ones.Test data sets and the proposed ant colony optimization algorithm are available on: http://bioserver.cs.put.poznan.pl/download/ACO4mSBH.zip.",

Herein we report what are to our knowledge the first metabolic gene knockout of gnd to have increased succinic acid production using both glucose and glycerol substrates in E. coli. Guided by a genome scale metabolic model, we engineered the E. coli host metabolism to enhance anaerobic production of succinic acid by deleting the gnd gene, considering its location in the boundary of oxidative and non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. This strategy induced either the activation of malic enzyme, causing up-regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (ppc) and down regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (ppck) and/or prevents the decarboxylation of 6 phosphogluconate to increase the pool of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) that is required for the formation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). This approach produced a mutant strain BMS2 with succinic acid production titers of 0.35 g l−1 and 1.40 g l−1 from glucose and glycerol substrates respectively. This work further clearly elucidates and informs other studies that the gnd gene, is a novel deletion target for increasing succinate production in E. coli under anaerobic condition using glucose and glycerol carbon sources.

Recently, the disintegrin and metalloprotease, ADAMTS1 has been demonstrated to be able to activate the transforming growth factor TGF-β, a major factor in fibrosis and cancer. The KTFR sequence from ADAMTS1 is responsible for the interaction with the LSKL peptide from the latent form of TGF-β, leading to its activation. While the atomic details of the interaction site can be the basis of the rational design of efficient inhibitory molecules, the binding mode of interaction is totally unknown.In this study, we show that recombinant fragments of human ADAMTS1 containing KTFR sequence keep the ability to bind the latent form of TGF-β. The recombinant fragment with the best affinity is modeled to investigate the binding mode of LSKL peptide with ADAMTS1 at the atomic level. Using a combined approach with molecular docking and multiple independent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we provide the binding mode of LSKL peptide with ADAMTS1. The MD simulations starting with the two lowest energy model predicted by molecular docking shows stable interactions characterized by 3 salt bridges (K3–NH3+ with E626–COO−; L4–COO− with K619–NH3+; L1–NH3+ with E624–COO−) and 2 hydrogen bonds (S2–OH with E623–COO−; L4–NH with E623–COO−).

     "abstract": "Protein structure prediction is considered as one of the most challenging and computationally intractable combinatorial problem. Thus, the efficient modeling of convoluted search space, the clever use of energy functions, and more importantly, the use of effective sampling algorithms become crucial to address this problem. For protein structure modeling, an off-lattice model provides limited scopes to exercise and evaluate the algorithmic developments due to its astronomically large set of data-points. In contrast, an on-lattice model widens the scopes and permits studying the relatively larger proteins because of its finite set of data-points. In this work, we took the full advantage of an on-lattice model by using a face-centered-cube lattice that has the highest packing density with the maximum degree of freedom. We proposed a graded energy—strategically mixes the Miyazawa–Jernigan (MJ) energy with the hydrophobic-polar (HP) energy—based genetic algorithm (GA) for conformational search. In our application, we introduced a 2 × 2 HP energy guided macro-mutation operator within the GA to explore the best possible local changes exhaustively. Conversely, the 20 × 20 MJ energy model—the ultimate objective function of our GA that needs to be minimized—considers the impacts amongst the 20 different amino acids and allow searching the globally acceptable conformations. On a set of benchmark proteins, our proposed approach outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the free energy levels and the root-mean-square deviations.",

The computational approach for predicting the HIA of molecules may potentiate the screening of new drugs. In this study, ensemble learning (EL) based qualitative and quantitative structure–activity relationship (SAR) models (gradient boosted tree, GBT and bagged decision tree, BDT) have been established for the binary classification and HIA prediction of the chemicals, using the selected molecular descriptors. The structural diversity of the chemicals and the nonlinear structure in the considered data were tested by the similarity index and Brock–Dechert–Scheinkman statistics. The external predictive power of the developed SAR models was evaluated through the internal and external validation procedures recommended in the literature. All the statistical criteria parameters derived for the performance of the constructed SAR models were above their respective thresholds suggesting for their robustness for future applications. In complete data, the qualitative SAR models rendered classification accuracy of >99%, while the quantitative SAR models yielded correlation (R2) of >0.91 between the measured and predicted HIA values. The performances of the EL-based SAR models were also compared with the linear models (linear discriminant analysis, LDA and multiple linear regression, MLR). The GBT and BDT SAR models performed better than the LDA and MLR methods. A comparison of our models with the previously reported QSARs for HIA prediction suggested for their better performance. The results suggest for the appropriateness of the developed SAR models to reliably predict the HIA of structurally diverse chemicals and can serve as useful tools for the initial screening of the molecules in the drug development process.",

It was found that the acrylodan moiety, which fluorescence is very sensitive to solvating properties of its microenvironment, was located on the surface of the native protein at 300 K that enabled its partial solvation with water. At high temperatures the protein structure significantly changed, as the secondary and tertiary structure elements were unfolded and these changes were sensitively reflected in positioning of the dye molecule. At 700 K complete unfolding of the protein occurred and the reporter group was entirely expelled into water. However, at 500 K an intermediate of the protein unfolding process was formed, where the fluorescence reporter group was directed towards the protein interior and buried in the core of the formed molten globule state.

As a treatment strategy targeting HIV-1 entry process, fusion inhibitors have been proposed. Nevertheless, development of a short peptide possessing high anti-HIV potency is considered a daunting challenge. He et al. found that two residues, Met626 and Thr627, located the upstream of the C-terminal heptad repeat of the gp41, formed a unique hook-like structure (M-T hook) that can dramatically improve the binding stability and anti-HIV activity of the inhibitors. In this work, we explored the molecular mechanism why M-T hook structure could improve the anti-HIV activity of inhibitors. Firstly, molecular dynamic simulation was used to obtain information on the time evolution between gp41 and ligands. Secondly, based on the simulations, molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) and molecular mechanics Generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) methods were used to calculate the binding free energies. The binding free energy of the ligand with M-T hook was considerably higher than the other without M-T. Further studies showed that the hydrophobic interactions made the dominant contribution to the binding free energy. The numbers of Hydrogen bonds between gp41 and the ligand with M-T hook structure were more than the other. These findings should provide insights into the inhibition mechanism of the short peptide fusion inhibitors and be useful for the rational design of novel fusion inhibitors in the future.",

Its structural characterization is required to enhance our current understanding of its mechanism of action which could help in identifying its receptor and/or other binding partners. Based on the physiological significance and necessity of exploring structural features of ANGPTL8, the present study is conducted with a specific aim to model the structure of ANGPTL8 and study its possible interactions with Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to predict 3-dimensional (3D) structure of ANGPTL8. Three different approaches were used for modeling of ANGPTL8 including homology modeling, de-novo structure prediction and their amalgam which is then proceeded by structure verification using ERRATT, PROSA, Qmean and Ramachandran plot scores. The selected models of ANGPTL8 were further evaluated for protein–protein interaction (PPI) analysis with LPL using CPORT and HADDOCK server. Our results have shown that the crystal structure of iSH2 domain of Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) p85β subunit (PDB entry: 3mtt) is a good candidate for homology modeling of ANGPTL8. Analysis of inter-molecular interactions between the structure of ANGPTL8 and LPL revealed existence of several non-covalent interactions. The residues of LPL involved in these interactions belong from its lid region, thrombospondin (TSP) region and heparin binding site which is suggestive of a possible role of ANGPTL8 in regulating the proteolysis, motility and localization of LPL. Besides, the conserved residues of SE1 region of ANGPTL8 formed interactions with the residues around the hinge region of LPL. Overall, our results support a model of inhibition of LPL by ANGPTL8 through the steric block of its catalytic site which will be further explored using wet lab studies in future.",

However, the mechanism by which the precursor mRNA to be transformed into a circular RNA or a linear mRNA is largely unknown.

In this study, we propose a new framework named IdealKnock, which is able to efficiently evaluate potentials of the production for different biochemical in a system by merely knocking out pathways. In addition, it is also capable of searching knockout strategies when combined with the OptKnock or OptGene framework. Furthermore, unlike other methods, IdealKnock suggests a series of mutants with targeted overproduction, which enables researchers to select the one of greatest interest for experimental validation. By testing the overproduction of a large number of native metabolites, IdealKnock showed its advantage in successfully breaking through the limitation of maximum knockout number in reasonable time and suggesting knockout strategies with better performance than other methods. In addition, gene–reaction relationship is well considered in the proposed framework.",

Here, the intramolecular KD–PBD complex in nPLK was investigated at structural level via bioinformatics analysis, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and binding affinity scoring. From the complex interface two regions representing separately two continuous peptide fragments in PBD domain were identified as the hot spots of KD–PBD interaction. Structural and energetic analysis suggested that one (PBD peptide 1) of the two peptides can bind tightly to a pocket nearby the active site of KD domain, which is thus potential as self-inhibitory peptide to target and suppress nPLK kinase activity. The knowledge harvesting from computational studies were then used to guide the structural optimization and mutation of PBD peptide 1. Consequently, two of three peptide mutants separately exhibited moderately and considerably increased affinity as compared to the native peptide.

     "abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a central role in the pathological progression and metastasis of lung cancer; the development and clinical application of therapeutic agents that target the receptor provide important insights for new lung cancer therapies. The tumor-suppressor protein MIG6 is a negative regulator of EGFR, which can bind at the activation interface of asymmetric dimer of EGFR kinase domains to disrupt dimerization and then inactivate the kinase (Zhang X. et al. Nature 2007, 450: 741–744). The protein adopts two separated segments, i.e. MIG6segment 1 and MIG6segment 2, to directly interact with EGFR. Here, computational modeling and analysis of the intermolecular interaction between EGFR kinase domain and MIG6segment 2 peptide revealed that the peptide is folded into a two-stranded β-sheet composed of β-strand 1 and β-strand 2; only the β-strand 2 can directly interact with EGFR activation loop, while leaving β-strand 1 apart from the kinase. A C-terminal island within the β-strand 2 is primarily responsible for peptide binding, which was truncated from the MIG6segment 2 and exhibited weak affinity to EGFR kinase domain. Structural and energetic analysis suggested that phosphorylation at residues Tyr394 and Tyr395 of truncated peptide can considerably improve EGFR affinity, and mutation of other residues can further optimize the peptide binding capability. Subsequently, three derivative versions of the truncated peptide, including phosphorylated and dephosphorylated peptides as well as a double-point mutant were synthesized and purified, and their affinities to the recombinant protein of human EGFR kinase domain were determined by fluorescence anisotropy titration. As expected theoretically, the dephosphorylated peptide has no observable binding to the kinase, and phosphorylation and mutation can confer low and moderate affinities to the peptide, respectively, suggesting a good consistence between the computational analysis and experimental assay.",

     "abstract": "The presence of repetitive or non-unique DNA persisting over sizable regions of a eukaryotic genome can hinder the genome's successful de novo assembly from short reads: ambiguities in assigning genome locations to the non-unique subsequences can result in premature termination of contigs and thus overfragmented assemblies. Fungal mitochondrial (mtDNA) genomes are compact (typically less than 100 kb), yet often contain short non-unique sequences that can be shown to impede their successful de novo assembly in silico. Such repeats can also confuse processes in the cell in vivo. A well-studied example is ectopic (out-of-register, illegitimate) recombination associated with repeat pairs, which can lead to deletion of functionally important genes that are located between the repeats. Repeats that remain conserved over micro- or macroevolutionary timescales despite such risks may indicate functionally or structurally (e.g., for replication) important regions. This principle could form the basis of a mining strategy for accelerating discovery of function in genome sequences. We present here our screening of a sample of 11 fully sequenced fungal mitochondrial genomes by observing where exact k-mer repeats occurred several times; initial analyses motivated us to focus on 17-mers occurring more than three times. Based on the diverse repeats we observe, we propose that such screening may serve as an efficient expedient for gaining a rapid but representative first insight into the repeat landscapes of sparsely characterized mitochondrial chromosomes. Our matching of the flagged repeats to previously reported regions of interest supports the idea that systems of persisting, non-trivial repeats in genomes can often highlight features meriting further attention.",

By analyzing the immune parameters of the conserved sequences of G glycoprotein using various databases and bioinformatics tools, we identified two potential epitopes which may be used as peptide vaccines. Using different B cell epitope prediction servers, four highly similar B cell epitopes were identified. Immunoinformatics analyses revealed that LAEDDTNAQKT is a highly flexible and accessible B-cell epitope to antibody. Highly similar putative CTL epitopes were analyzed for their binding with the HLA-C 12*03 molecule. Docking simulation assay revealed that LTDKIGTEI has significantly lower binding energy, which bolstered its potential as epitope-based vaccine design. Finally, cytotoxicity analysis has also justified their potential as promising epitope-based vaccine candidate.

     "abstract": "Glucokinase (GK) plays a critical role in maintaining glucose homeostasis in the human liver and pancreas. In the liver, the activity of GK is modulated by the glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) which functions as a competitive inhibitor of glucose to bind to GK. Moreover, the inhibitory intensity of GKRP–GK is suppressed by fructose 1-phosphate (F1P), and reinforced by fructose 6-phosphate (F6P). Here, we employed a series of computational techniques to explore the interactions of fructose phosphates with GKRP. Calculation results reveal that F1P and F6P can bind to the same active site of GKRP with different binding modes, and electrostatic interaction provides a major driving force for the ligand binding. The presence of fructose phosphate severely influences the motions of protein and the conformational space, and the structural change of sugar phosphate influences its interactions with GKRP, leading to a large conformational rearrangement of loop2 in the SIS2 domain. In particular, the binding of F6P to GKRP facilitates the protruding loop2 contacting with GK to form the stable GK–GKRP complex. The conserved residues 179–184 of GKRP play a major role in the binding of phosphate group and maintaining the stability of GKRP. These results may provide deep insight into the regulatory mechanism of GKRP to the activity of GK.",

     "abstract": "Non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are common allergens and they are particularly widespread within the plant kingdom. They have a highly conserved three-dimensional structure that generate a strong cross-reactivity among the members of this family. In the last years several web tools for the prediction of allergenicity of new molecules based on their homology with known allergens have been released, and guidelines to assess potential allergenicity of proteins through bioinformatics have been established. Even if such tools are only partially reliable yet, they can provide important indications when other kinds of molecular characterization are lacking. The potential allergenicity of 28 amino acid sequences of LTPs homologs, either retrieved from the UniProt database or in silico deduced from the corresponding EST coding sequence, was predicted using 7 publicly available web tools. Moreover, their similarity degree to their closest known LTP allergens was calculated, in order to evaluate their potential cross-reactivity. Finally, all sequences were studied for their identity degree with the peach allergen Pru p 3, considering the regions involved in the formation of its known conformational IgE-binding epitope. Most of the analyzed sequences displayed a high probability to be allergenic according to all the software employed. The analyzed LTPs from bell pepper, cassava, mango, mungbean and soybean showed high homology (>70%) with some known allergenic LTPs, suggesting a potential risk of cross-reactivity for sensitized individuals. Other LTPs, like for example those from canola, cassava, mango, mungbean, papaya or persimmon, displayed a high degree of identity with Pru p 3 within the consensus sequence responsible for the formation, at three-dimensional level, of its major conformational epitope. Since recent studies highlighted how in patients mono-sensitized to peach LTP the levels of IgE seem directly proportional to the chance of developing cross-reactivity to LTPs from non-Rosaceae foods, and these chances increase the more similar the protein is to Pru p 3, these proteins should be taken into special account for future studies aimed at evaluating the risk of cross-allergenicity in highly sensitized individuals.",

In the present paper, we focus on improved heuristic implementations of the general framework devised by Granier and Kallel with regard to run-time behaviour and accuracy of predictions. The new heuristic method is demonstrated for the case of partial energy landscapes induced by RNA secondary structures. While the computation of minimum free energy RNA secondary structures has been studied for a long time, the analysis of folding landscapes has gained momentum over the past years in the context of co-transcriptional folding and deeper insights into cell processes. The new approach has been applied to ten RNA instances of length between 99 nt and 504 nt and their respective partial energy landscapes defined by secondary structures within an energy offset ΔE above the minimum free energy conformation. The number of local minima within the partial energy landscapes ranges from 1440 to 3441. Our heuristic method produces for the best approximations on average a deviation below 3.0% from the true number of local minima.",

However, the main challenge of gene expression data analysis is high dimensionality, and microarray is characterised by few number of samples with large number of genes. To overcome this problem, a variety of penalised Cox proportional hazard models have been proposed. We introduce a novel network regularised Cox proportional hazard model and a novel multiplex network model to measure the disease comorbidities and to predict survival of the cancer patient. Our methods are applied to analyse seven microarray cancer gene expression datasets: breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, renal cancer and osteosarcoma. Firstly, we applied a principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of original gene expression data. Secondly, we applied a network regularised Cox regression model on the reduced gene expression datasets. By using normalised mutual information method and multiplex network model, we predict the comorbidities for the liver cancer based on the integration of diverse set of omics and clinical data, and we find the diseasome associations (disease–gene association) among different cancers based on the identified common significant genes. Finally, we evaluated the precision of the approach with respect to the accuracy of survival prediction using ROC curves. We report that colon cancer, liver cancer and renal cancer share the CXCL5 gene, and breast cancer, ovarian cancer and renal cancer share the CCND2 gene.

Moreover, the existing methods do not employ the idea of core-periphery structural pattern of protein complexes effectively to extract clusters. In this paper, we introduce a clustering method named CPCA based on a recent observation by researchers that a protein complex in a PPI network is arranged as a relatively dense core region and additional proteins weakly connected to the core. CPCA uses two connectivity criterion functions to identify core and peripheral regions of the cluster. To locate initial node of a cluster we introduce a measure called DNQ (Degree based Neighborhood Qualification) index that evaluates tendency of the node to be part of a cluster. CPCA performs well when compared with well-known counterparts. Along with protein complex gold standards, a co-localization dataset has also been used for validation of the results.",

This pathway, however, crosstalks with several other molecular pathways, a fact that may have consequences for the effectiveness of hormone modulating drug therapies, such as tamoxifen. For this work, we performed a systematic analysis of the major routes involved in crosstalk phenomena with the estrogen pathway – based on gene expression experiments (819 samples) and pathway analysis (493 samples) – for biopsy-captured tissue and contrasted in two independent datasets with in vivo and in vitro pharmacological stimulation. Our results confirm the presence of a number of crosstalk events across the estrogen signaling pathway with others that are dysregulated in different molecular subtypes of breast cancer.

Under certain circumstances, gene regulatory programs may give rise to amplification cascades. Such transcriptional cascades are events in which activation of key-responsive transcription factors called master regulators trigger a series of gene expression events. The action of transcriptional master regulators is then important for the establishment of certain programs like cell development and differentiation. However, such cascades have also been related with the onset and maintenance of cancer phenotypes. Here we present a systematic implementation of a series of algorithms aimed at the inference of a gene regulatory network and analysis of transcriptional master regulators in the context of primary breast cancer cells. Such studies were performed in a highly curated database of 880 microarray gene expression experiments on biopsy-captured tissue corresponding to primary breast cancer and healthy controls. Biological function and biochemical pathway enrichment analyses were also performed to study the role that the processes controlled – at the transcriptional level – by such master regulators may have in relation to primary breast cancer. We found that transcription factors such as AGTR2, ZNF132, TFDP3 and others are master regulators in this gene regulatory network. Sets of genes controlled by these regulators are involved in processes that are well-known hallmarks of cancer.

We applied this approach to Mycoplasma genitalium, a common cause of urethritis. First, we used quantitative metabolic modeling to identify enzymes whose expression affects the cellular growth rate. Second, we searched the literature for inhibitors of homologs of the most fragile enzymes. Next, we used sequence alignment to assess that the binding site is shared by M. genitalium, but not by humans. Lastly, we used molecular docking to verify that the reported inhibitors preferentially interact with M. genitalium proteins over their human homologs. Thymidylate kinase was the top predicted target and piperidinylthymines were the top compounds. Further work is needed to experimentally validate piperidinylthymines. In summary, combined systems and structural modeling is a powerful tool for drug repositioning.",

     "abstract": "A major theme in constraint-based modeling is unifying experimental data, such as biochemical information about the reactions that can occur in a system or the composition and localization of enzyme complexes, with high-throughput data including expression data, metabolomics, or DNA sequencing. The desired result is to increase predictive capability and improve our understanding of metabolism. The approach typically employed when only gene (or protein) intensities are available is the creation of tissue-specific models, which reduces the available reactions in an organism model, and does not provide an objective function for the estimation of fluxes. We develop a method, flux assignment with LAD (least absolute deviation) convex objectives and normalization (FALCON), that employs metabolic network reconstructions along with expression data to estimate fluxes. In order to use such a method, accurate measures of enzyme complex abundance are needed, so we first present an algorithm that addresses quantification of complex abundance. Our extensions to prior techniques include the capability to work with large models and significantly improved run-time performance even for smaller models, an improved analysis of enzyme complex formation, the ability to handle large enzyme complex rules that may incorporate multiple isoforms, and either maintained or significantly improved correlation with experimentally measured fluxes. FALCON has been implemented in MATLAB and ATS, and can be downloaded from: https://github.com/bbarker/FALCON. ATS is not required to compile the software, as intermediate C source code is available.

During sporulation MurG was gradually enriched to the membrane at the forespore and point mutations in a MurG helical domain disrupting its localization to the membrane caused severe sporulation defects, but did not affect localization nor caused detectable defects during exponential growth. We found that this localization is dependent on the phospholipid cardiolipin, as in strains where the cardiolipin-synthesizing genes were deleted, MurG levels were diminished at the forespore. Furthermore, in this cardiolipin-less strain, MurG localization during sporulation was rescued by external addition of purified cardiolipin. These results support localization as a critical factor in the regulation of proper enzyme function and catalysis.",

It may happen in a short time span as the outbreak of H7N9 is more and more recurrent, which implies that H7N9 evolution is speeding up. H7N9 flu strains were not known to infect humans before this attack in China in February 2013 and it was solely an avian strain. While currently available drugs such as oseltamivir have been found to be largely effective against the H7N9, albeit with recent reported cases of development of resistance to the drug, there is a necessity to identify alternatives to combat this disease, especially if it assumes pandemic proportions. In our work, we have tried to investigate for the genetic changes in hemagglutinin (HA) protein sequence that lead to human infection by an avian infecting virus and identify possible peptide targets to design vaccines to control this upcoming risk.We identified three highly conserved regions in all H7 subtypes, of which one particular immunogenic surface exposed region was found to be well conserved in all human infecting H7N9 strains (accessed up to 27th March 2014). Compared to H7N9 avian strains, we identified two mutations in this conserved region at the receptor binding site of all post-February 2013 human-infecting H7N9China hemagglutinin protein sequences. One of the mutations is very close (3.6 Å) to the hemagglutinin sialic acid binding pocket that may lead to better binding to human host’s sialic acid due to the changes in hydrophobicity of the microenvironment of the binding site. We found that the peptide region with these mutational changes that are specific for human infecting H7N9 virus possess the possibility of being used as target for a peptide vaccine.",

They undergo disorder to order transition upon binding their partners. Intrinsic disorder is attributed to histones H1, perceived as assemblers of chromatin structure and the regulators of DNA and proteins activity. In this work, the comparison of intrinsic disorder abundance in the histone H1 subtypes was performed both by the analysis of their amino acid composition and by the prediction of disordered stretches, as well as by identifying molecular recognition features (MoRFs) and ANCHOR protein binding regions (APBR) that are responsible for recognition and binding. Both human and model organisms—animals, plants, fungi and protists—have H1 histone subtypes with the properties typical of disordered state. They possess a significantly higher content of hydrophilic and charged amino acid residues, arranged in the long regions, covering over half of the whole amino acid residues in chain. Almost complete disorder corresponds to histone H1 terminal domains, including MoRFs and ANCHOR. Those motifs were also identified in a more ordered histone H1 globular domain. Compared to the control (globular and fibrous) proteins, H1 histones demonstrate the increased folding rate and a higher proportion of low-complexity segments. The results of this work indicate that intrinsic disorder is an inherent structural property of histone H1 subtypes and it is essential for establishing a protein conformation which defines functional outcomes affecting on DNA- and/or partner protein-dependent cell processes.",

DNA gyrase enzymes are an excellent target for antibacterial drug discovery as they are involved in essential functions like DNA replication. Here we report, a successful application of high throughput virtual screening (HTVS) to identify an inhibitor of Mycobacterium DNA gyrase targeting the wild type and the most prevalent three double mutants of quinolone resistant DNA gyrase namely A90V + D94G, A74S + D94G and A90V + S91P. HTVS of 179.299 compounds gave five compounds with significant binding affinity. Extra presicion (XP) docking and MD simulations gave a clear view of their interaction pattern. Among them, chebulinic acid (CA), a phytocompound obtained from Terminalia chebula was the most potent inhibitor with significantly high XP docking score, −14.63, −16.46, −15.94 and −15.11 against wild type and three variants respectively. Simulation studies for a period of 16 ns indicated stable DNA gyrA–CA complex formation. This stable binding would result in inhibition of the enzyme by two mechanisms. Firstly, binding of CA causes displacement of catalytic Tyr129 away from its target DNA-phosphate molecule from 1.6 Å to 3.8–7.3 Å and secondly, by causing steric hindrance to the binding of DNA strand at DNA binding site of enzyme. The combined effect would result in loss of cleavage and religation activity of enzyme leading to bactericidal effect on tuberculosis. This phytocompound displays desirable quality for carrying forward as a lead compound for anti-tuberculosis drug development. The results presented here are solely based on computations and need to be validated experimentally in order to assert the proposed mechanism of action.",

Many glycoconjugate compounds are present on the entire cell surface of Trypanosoma brucei to control the infectivity and survival of this pathogen. These gycoconjugates are anchored to the plasma membrane with the help of glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchors. This type of anchor is much more common in protozoans than in other eukaryotes. The second step of glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis is catalyzed by an enzyme, which is GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase. GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase has a conserved GPI domain, which is responsible for the functionality of this enzyme. In this study, the three-dimensional structure of the target is modelled by I-TASSER and the ligand is modelled by PRODRG server. It is found that the predicted active site residues of the GPI domain are ultra-conserved for the Trypanosomatidae family. The predicted active site residues are His41, Pro42, Asp43, Asp44, Met47, Phe48, Ser74, Arg80, His103, Val144, Ser145, His147 and His150. Two hydrogen bond acceptors and four hydrogen bond donors are found in the modelled pharmacophore. All compounds of the Drugbank database and twenty three known inhibitors have been considered for structure based virtual screening. This work is focused on approved drugs because they are already tested for safety and effectiveness in humans. After the structure-based virtual screening, seventeen approved drugs and two inhibitors are found, which interact with the ligand on the basis of the designed pharmacophore.

Two approved drugs have negative binding energy and their pKa values are similar to the selected known inhibitors.

Then support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) is adopted to select top K features according to their importance and these features are input to a support vector machine (SVM) to conduct the prediction. Performance evaluation of the proposed method is performed using the jackknife test on three low-similarity datasets, i.e., D640, 1189 and 25PDB.

     "abstract": "Lipocalins are short in sequence length and perform several important biological functions. These proteins are having less than 20% sequence similarity among paralogs. Experimentally identifying them is an expensive and time consuming process. The computational methods based on the sequence similarity for allocating putative members to this family are also far elusive due to the low sequence similarity existing among the members of this family. Consequently, the machine learning methods become a viable alternative for their prediction by using the underlying sequence/structurally derived features as the input. Ideally, any machine learning based prediction method must be trained with all possible variations in the input feature vector (all the sub-class input patterns) to achieve perfect learning. A near perfect learning can be achieved by training the model with diverse types of input instances belonging to the different regions of the entire input space. Furthermore, the prediction performance can be improved through balancing the training set as the imbalanced data sets will tend to produce the prediction bias towards majority class and its sub-classes. This paper is aimed to achieve (i) the high generalization ability without any classification bias through the diversified and balanced training sets as well as (ii) enhanced the prediction accuracy by combining the results of individual classifiers with an appropriate fusion scheme. Instead of creating the training set randomly, we have first used the unsupervised Kmeans clustering algorithm to create diversified clusters of input patterns and created the diversified and balanced training set by selecting an equal number of patterns from each of these clusters. Finally, probability based classifier fusion scheme was applied on boosted random forest algorithm (which produced greater sensitivity) and K nearest neighbour algorithm (which produced greater specificity) to achieve the enhanced predictive performance than that of individual base classifiers. The performance of the learned models trained on Kmeans preprocessed training set is far better than the randomly generated training sets. The proposed method achieved a sensitivity of 90.6%, specificity of 91.4% and accuracy of 91.0% on the first test set and sensitivity of 92.9%, specificity of 96.2% and accuracy of 94.7% on the second blind test set. These results have established that diversifying training set improves the performance of predictive models through superior generalization ability and balancing the training set improves prediction accuracy. For smaller data sets, unsupervised Kmeans based sampling can be an effective technique to increase generalization than that of the usual random splitting method.",

However, most of these studies are very limited, as they only analyze SNPs in coding regions or when applied to promoters, and do not integrate essential biological data like TFBSs, expression profiles, pathway analysis, homotypic redundancy (number of TFBSs for the same TF in a region), chromatin accessibility and others, which could lead to a more accurate prediction. Our aim was to integrate different data in a biologically coherent method to analyze the proximal promoter regions of two antimicrobial peptide genes, DEFB1 and CAMP, that are associated with tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS. We predicted SNPs within the promoter regions that are more likely to interact with transcription factors (TFs). We also assessed the impact of homotypic redundancy using a novel approach called the homotypic redundancy weight factor (HWF). Our results identified 10 SNPs, which putatively modify the binding affinity of 24 TFs previously identified as related to TB and HIV/AIDS expression profiles (e.g. KLF5, CEBPA and NFKB1 for TB; FOXP2, BRCA1, CEBPB, CREB1, EBF1 and ZNF354C for HIV/AIDS; and RUNX2, HIF1A, JUN/AP-1, NR4A2, EGR1 for both diseases). Validating with the OregAnno database and cell-specific functional/non functional SNPs from additional 13 genes, our algorithm performed 53% sensitivity and 84.6% specificity to detect functional rSNPs using the DNAseI-HUP database. We are proposing our algorithm as a novel in silico method to detect true functional rSNPs in antimicrobial peptide genes. With further improvement, this novel method could be applied to other promoters in order to design probes and to discover new drug targets for complex diseases.",

     "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides have emerged as new therapeutic agents for fighting multi-drug-resistant bacteria. However, the process of optimizing peptide antimicrobial activity and specificity using large peptide libraries is both tedious and expensive. Therefore, computational techniques had to be applied for process optimization. In this work, the representation of the molecular structure of peptides (mastoparan analogs) by a sequence of amino acids has been used to establish quantitative structure—activity relationships (QSARs) for their antibacterial activity. The data for the studied peptides were split three times into the training, calibration and test sets. The Monte Carlo method was used as a computational technique for QSAR models calculation. The statistical quality of QSAR for the antibacterial activity of peptides for the external validation set was: n = 7, r2 = 0.8067, s = 0.248 (split 1); n = 6, r2 = 0.8319, s = 0.169 (split 2); and n = 6, r2 = 0.6996, s = 0.297 (split 3). The stated statistical parameters favor the presented QSAR models in comparison to 2D and 3D descriptor based ones. The Monte Carlo method gave a reasonably good prediction for the antibacterial activity of peptides. The statistical quality of the prediction is different for three random splits. However, the predictive potential is reasonably well for all cases. The presented QSAR modeling approach can be an attractive alternative of 3D QSAR at least for the described peptides.",

A total of 22 miRNAs belonging to 17 miRNA families were identified in hop following comparative computational approach and EST-based homology search according to a series of filtering criteria. Selected miRNAs were validated by end-point PCR and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), confirmed the existence of conserved miRNAs in hop. Based on the characteristic that miRNAs exhibit perfect or nearly perfect complementarity with their targeted mRNA sequences, a total of 47 potential miRNA targets were identified in hop. Strikingly, the majority of predicted targets were belong to transcriptional factors which could regulate hop growth and development, including leaf, root and even cone development. Moreover, the identified miRNAs may also be involved in other cellular and metabolic processes, such as stress response, signal transduction, and other physiological processes. The cis-regulatory elements relevant to biotic and abiotic stress, plant hormone response, flavonoid biosynthesis were identified in the promoter regions of those miRNA genes. Overall, findings from this study will accelerate the way for further researches of miRNAs, their functions in hop and shows a path for the prediction and analysis of miRNAs to those species whose genomes are not available.",

Conformational preferences of amino acid residues and secondary structure information were obtained from protein templates stored in the Protein Data Bank and represented as an Angle Probability List. Two knowledge-based prediction methods based on Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization were developed using this information.

A translation (framing) code based on the circular code was proposed in Michel (2012) with the identification of several X circular code motifs (X motifs shortly) in both ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and their decoding center, and transfer RNAs (tRNAs). We extended these results in two ways. First, three universal X motifs were determined in the ribosome decoding center: the X motif mAA containing the conserved nucleotides A1492 and A1493, the X motif mG containing the conserved nucleotide G530 and the X motif m with unknown biological function (El Soufi and Michel, 2014). Secondly, statistical analysis of X motifs of greatest lengths performed on different and large tRNA populations according to taxonomy, tRNA length and tRNA score showed that these X motifs have occurrence probabilities in the 5′ and/or 3′ regions of 16 isoaccepting tRNAs of prokaryotes and eukaryotes greater than the random case (Michel, 2013). We continue here the previous works with the identification of X motifs in rRNAs of prokaryotes and eukaryotes near the ribosome decoding center. Seven X motifs PrRNAXm conserved in 16S rRNAs of prokaryotes P and four X motifs ErRNAXm conserved in 18S rRNAs of eukaryotes E are identified near the ribosome decoding center. Furthermore, four very large X motifs of length greater than or equal to 20 nucleotides, 14 large X motifs of length between 16 and 19 nucleotides and several X motifs of length greater or equal to 9 nucleotides are found in tRNAs of prokaryotes. Some properties of these X motifs in tRNAs are described. These new results strengthen the concept of a translation code based on the circular code (Michel, 2012).",

These redox processes utilize different sulfur anions and the reactions are performed by the gene products of dsr operon from phylogenetically diverse sets of microorganisms. The operon is involved in the maintenance of environmental sulfur balance. Interestingly, the dsr operon is found to be present in both sulfur anion oxidizing and reducing microorganisms and in both types of organisms DsrAB protein complex plays a vital role. Though there are various reports regarding the genetics of dsr operon there are practically no reports dealing with the structural aspects of sulfur metabolism by dsr operon. In our present study, we tried to compare the mechanisms of sulfur anion oxidation and reduction by Allochromatium vinosum and Desulfovibrio vulgaris respectively through DsrAB protein complex. We analyzed the modes of bindings of sulfur anions to the DsrAB protein complex and observed that for sulfur anion oxidizers, sulfide and thiosulfate are the best substrates whereas for reducers sulfate and sulfite have the best binding abilities. We analyzed the binding interaction pattern of the DsrA and DsrB proteins while forming the DsrAB protein complexes in Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Allochromatium vinosum. To our knowledge this is the first report that analyzes the differences in binding patterns of sulfur substrates with DsrAB protein from these two microorganisms. This study would therefore be essential to predict the biochemical mechanism of sulfur anion oxidation and reduction by these two microorganisms i.e., Desulfovibrio vulgaris (sulfur anion reducer) and Allochromatium vinosum (sulfur anion oxidizer). Our observations also highlight the mechanism of sulfur geochemical cycle which has important implications in future study of sulfur metabolism as it has a huge application in waste remediation and production of industrial bio-products viz. vitamins, bio-polyesters and bio-hydrogen.",

However, they did not satisfy essential pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties thus, almost most of them were terminated in pre-clinical or clinical studies. This study aims to design new specific MEK1/2 inhibitors with improved PK/PD profiles to be used as alternative cancer medications. In first part of this study, a comprehensive screening, for the first time, was done on well-known MEK1/2 inhibitors using a number of computational programs such as AutoDock Tools 4.2 (ADT) and AutoDock Vina. Therefore a valuable training dataset as well as a reliable pharmacophore model were provided which were then used to design new inhibitors. According to the results of training dataset, Trametinib was determined as the best inhibitor provided, so far. So, Trametinib was used as the lead structure to design new inhibitors in this study. In second part of this investigation, a set of new allosteric MEK1/2 inhibitors were designed significantly improving the binding energy as well as the ADMET properties, suggesting more specific and stable ligand-receptor complexes. Consequently, the structures 14 and 15 of our inhibitors, as the most potent structures, are great substituents for Trametinib to be used and evaluated in clinical trials as alternative cancer drugs.",

Although enolase multifunctionality has been described for several organisms, the conservation of enolase alternative functions through different phyla has not been explored with more details. A useful strategy to investigate moonlighting functions is the use of systems biology tools, which allow the prediction of protein functions/interactions by graph design and analysis. In this work, available information from protein–protein interaction (PPI) databases were used to design enolase PPI networks for four eukaryotic organisms, namely Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, covering a wide spectrum of this domain of life. PPI networks with number of nodes ranging from 140 to 411 and up to 15,855 connections were generated, and modularity and centrality analyses, and functional enrichment were performed for all of them. The performed analyses showed that enolase is a central node within the networks, and that, in addition to its canonical interactions with proteins related to glycolysis and energetic metabolism, it is also part of protein clusters related to different biological processes, like transcription, development, and apoptosis, among others. Some of these non-glycolytic clusters, are partially conserved between networks, in terms of overall sharing of orthologs, overall cluster structure, and/or at the levels of key regulatory proteins within clusters. Overall, our results provided evidences of enolase multifunctionality and evolutionary conservation of enolase PPIs at all these levels.",

     "abstract": "The complexity of DNA can be quantified using estimates of entropy. Variation in DNA complexity is expected between the promoters of genes with different transcriptional mechanisms; namely housekeeping (HK) and tissue specific (TS). The former are transcribed constitutively to maintain general cellular functions, and the latter are transcribed in restricted tissue and cells types for specific molecular events. It is known that promoter features in the human genome are related to tissue specificity, but this has been difficult to quantify on a genomic scale. If entropy effectively quantifies DNA complexity, calculating the entropies of HK and TS gene promoters as profiles may reveal significant differences.Entropy profiles were calculated for a total dataset of 12,003 human gene promoters and for 501 housekeeping (HK) and 587 tissue specific (TS) human gene promoters. The mean profiles show the TS promoters have a significantly lower entropy (p < 2.2e − 16) than HK gene promoters. The entropy distributions for the 3 datasets show that promoter entropies could be used to identify novel HK genes.Functional features comprise DNA sequence patterns that are non-random and hence they have lower entropies. The lower entropy of TS gene promoters can be explained by a higher density of positive and negative regulatory elements, required for genes with complex spatial and temporary expression.",

The QM based solvent model (PCM/SMD) gives different values from those used in the implicit PBSA solvent MM models.

However, whether the other small RNAs (sRNAs) possess stress-related roles remains elusive.

Within certain subnetworks, some target genes were further supported by microarray data. Literature mining indicated that certain targets were potentially involved in stress response. These results demonstrate that the established networks are biologically meaningful. We discovered that in some cases, one sRNA sequence could be assigned to two or more categories. Moreover, within certain target-centered subnetworks, one transcript was regulated by several stress-responsive sRNAs assigned to different categories. It implies that these subnetworks are potentially implicated in stress signal crosstalk. Together, our results could advance the current understanding of the biological role of plant sRNAs in stress signaling.",

In this study, plant LYCs were analyzed. Based on domain analysis, all LYCs accommodate lycopene cyclase domain (Pf05834). Furthermore, motif analysis indicated that motifs were conserved among the plants. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, β-LCYs and ϵ-LCYs were classified in β and ϵ groups. Monocot and dicot plants separated from each other in the phylogenetic tree. Subsequently, Oryza sativa Japonica Group and Zea mays of LYCs as monocot plants and Vitis vinifera and Solanum lycopersicum of LYCs as dicot plants were analyzed. According to nucleotide diversity analysis of β-LCY and ϵ-LCY genes, nucleotide diversities were found to be π: 0.30 and π: 0.25, respectively. The result highlighted β-LCY genes showed higher nucleotide diversity than ϵ-LCY genes. LYCs interacting genes and their co-expression partners were also predicted using String server. The obtained data suggested the importance of LYCs in carotenoid metabolism. 3D modeling revealed that depicted structures were similar in O. sativa, Z mays, S. lycopersicum, and V. vinifera β-LCYs and ϵ-LCYs. Likewise, the predicted binding sites were highly similar between O. sativa, Z mays, S. lycopersicum, and V. vinifera LCYs. Most importantly, analysis elucidated the V/IXGXGXXGXXXA motif for both type of LYC (β-LCY and ϵ-LCY). This motif related to Rossmann fold domain and probably provides a flat platform for binding of FAD in O. sativa, Z mays, S. lycopersicum, and V. vinifera β-LCYs and ϵ-LCYs with conserved structure. In addition to lycopene cyclase domain, the V/IXGXGXXGXXXA motif can be used for exploring LYCs proteins and to annotate the function of unknown proteins containing lycopene cyclase domain.

In structural terms, 60% of TFs are composed by two-domains, 30% are monodomain, and 10% three- and four-structural domains. As previously noticed, the most abundant DNA-binding domain corresponds to the winged helix-turn-helix, with few alternative DNA-binding structures, resembling the hypothesis of successful protein structures with the emergence of new ones at low scales. In summary, we identified and described the characteristics associated to the DNA-binding TF in E. coli K-12. We also identified twelve functional modules based on a co-regulated gene matrix. Finally, diverse regulons were predicted based on direct associations between the TFs and potential regulated genes. This analysis should increase our knowledge about the gene regulation in the bacterium E. coli K-12, and provide more additional clues for comprehensive modelling of transcriptional regulatory networks in other bacteria.",

     "abstract": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a potent human and livestock pathogen endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula that has potential to spread to other parts of the world. Although there is no proven effective and safe treatment for RVFV infections, a potential therapeutic target is the virally encoded nucleocapsid protein (N). During the course of infection, N binds to viral RNA, and perturbation of this interaction can inhibit viral replication. To gain insight into how N recognizes viral RNA specifically, we designed an algorithm that uses a distance matrix and multidimensional scaling to compare the predicted secondary structures of known N-binding RNAs, or aptamers, that were isolated and characterized in previous in vitro evolution experiment. These aptamers did not exhibit overt sequence or predicted structure similarity, so we employed bioinformatic methods to propose novel aptamers based on analysis and clustering of secondary structures. We screened and scored the predicted secondary structures of novel randomly generated RNA sequences in silico and selected several of these putative N-binding RNAs whose secondary structures were similar to those of known N-binding RNAs. We found that overall the in silico generated RNA sequences bound well to N in vitro. Furthermore, introduction of these RNAs into cells prior to infection with RVFV inhibited viral replication in cell culture. This proof of concept study demonstrates how the predictive power of bioinformatics and the empirical power of biochemistry can be jointly harnessed to discover, synthesize, and test new RNA sequences that bind tightly to RVFV N protein. The approach would be easily generalizable to other applications.",

     "abstract": "Yersinia organisms cause many infectious diseases by invading human cells and delivering their virulence factors via the type three secretion system (T3SS). One alternative strategy in the fight against these pathogenic organisms is to interfere with their T3SS. Previous studies demonstrated that thiol peroxidase, Tpx is functional in the assembly of T3SS and its inhibition by salicylidene acylhydrazides prevents the secretion of pathogenic effectors. In this study, the aim was to identify potential inhibitors of Tpx using an integrated approach starting with high throughput virtual screening and ending with molecular dynamics simulations of selected ligands. Virtual screening of ZINC database of 500,000 compounds via ligand-based and structure-based pharmacophore models retrieved 10,000 hits. The structure-based pharmacophore model was validated using high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS). After multistep docking (SP and XP), common scaffolds were used to find common substructures and the ligand binding poses were optimized using induced fit docking. The stability of the protein–ligand complex was examined with molecular dynamics simulations and the binding free energy of the complex was calculated. As a final outcome eight compounds with different chemotypes were proposed as potential inhibitors for Tpx. The eight ligands identified by a detailed virtual screening protocol can serve as leads in future drug design efforts against the destructive actions of pathogenic bacteria.",

     "abstract": "Many studies have shown roles of microRNAs on human disease and a number of computational methods have been proposed to predict such associations by ranking candidate microRNAs according to their relevance to a disease. Among them, machine learning-based methods usually have a limitation in specifying non-disease microRNAs as negative training samples. Meanwhile, network-based methods are becoming dominant since they well exploit a “disease module” principle in microRNA functional similarity networks. Of which, random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm-based method is currently state-of-the-art. The use of this algorithm was inspired from its success in predicting disease gene because the “disease module” principle also exists in protein interaction networks. Besides, many algorithms designed for webpage ranking have been successfully applied in ranking disease candidate genes because web networks share topological properties with protein interaction networks. However, these algorithms have not yet been utilized for disease microRNA prediction.We constructed microRNA functional similarity networks based on shared targets of microRNAs, and then we integrated them with a microRNA functional synergistic network, which was recently identified. After analyzing topological properties of these networks, in addition to RWR, we assessed the performance of (i) PRINCE (PRIoritizatioN and Complex Elucidation), which was proposed for disease gene prediction; (ii) PageRank with Priors (PRP) and K-Step Markov (KSM), which were used for studying web networks; and (iii) a neighborhood-based algorithm.Analyses on topological properties showed that all microRNA functional similarity networks are small-worldness and scale-free. The performance of each algorithm was assessed based on average AUC values on 35 disease phenotypes and average rankings of newly discovered disease microRNAs. As a result, the performance on the integrated network was better than that on individual ones. In addition, the performance of PRINCE, PRP and KSM was comparable with that of RWR, whereas it was worst for the neighborhood-based algorithm. Moreover, all the algorithms were stable with the change of parameters. Final, using the integrated network, we predicted six novel miRNAs (i.e., hsa-miR-101, hsa-miR-181d, hsa-miR-192, hsa-miR-423-3p, hsa-miR-484 and hsa-miR-98) associated with breast cancer.Network-based ranking algorithms, which were successfully applied for either disease gene prediction or for studying social/web networks, can be also used effectively for disease microRNA prediction.",

GolS protein sequences were identified to include glyco_transf_8 (PF01501) domain structure, and to have a close molecular weight (36.40–39.59 kDa) and amino acid length (318–347 aa) with a slightly acidic pI (5.35–6.40).

S. lycopersicum genes located on chr 1 and 2, and included one segmental duplication while genes of B. distachyon were only on chr 1 with one tandem duplication. GolS sequences were found to have well conserved motif structures. Cis-acting analysis was performed for three abiotic stress responsive elements, including ABA responsive element (ABRE), dehydration and cold responsive elements (DRE/CRT) and low-temperature responsive element (LTRE). ABRE elements were found in all GolS genes, except for SlGolS4; DRE/CRT was not detected in any GolS genes and LTRE element found in SlGolS1 and BdGolS1 genes. AU analysis in UTR and ORF regions indicated that SlGolS and BdGolS mRNAs may have a short half-life. SlGolS3 and SlGolS4 genes may generate more stable transcripts since they included AATTAAA motif for polyadenylation signal POLASIG2. Seconder structures of SlGolS proteins were well conserved than that of BdGolS.

Known transcriptional regulators associated with this process are called xenogeneic silencers (XS) and belong to either the H-NS, Lsr2, MvaT or Rok families. In the work described here we looked for XS-like regulators and their distribution in prokaryotic organisms was evaluated. Our analysis showed that putative XS regulators similar to H-NS, Lsr2, MvaT or Rok are present only in bacteria (31.7%). This does not exclude the existence of alternative XS in the rest of the organisms analyzed. Additionally, of the four XS groups evaluated in this work, those from the H-NS family have diversified more than the other groups. In order to compare the distribution of these putative XS regulators we also searched for other nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) not included in this group such as Fis, EbfC/YbaB, HU/IHF and Alba. Results showed that NAPs from the Fis, EbfC/YbaB, HU/IHF and Alba families are widely (94%) distributed among prokaryotes. These NAPs were found in multiple combinations with or without XS-like proteins. In regard with XS regulators, results showed that only XS proteins from one family were found in those organisms containing them.

Existing computational methods to detect protein complexes are usually based on specific network topological properties of PPI networks. However, due to the inherent complexity of the network structures, the identification of protein complexes may not be fully addressed by using single network topological property. In this study, we propose a novel MultiObjective Evolutionary Programming Genetic Algorithm (MOEPGA) which integrates multiple network topological features to detect biologically meaningful protein complexes. Our approach first systematically analyzes the multiobjective problem in terms of identifying protein complexes from PPI networks, and then constructs the objective function of the iterative algorithm based on three common topological properties of protein complexes from the benchmark dataset, finally we describe our algorithm, which mainly consists of three steps, population initialization, subgraph mutation and subgraph selection operation. To show the utility of our method, we compared MOEPGA with several state-of-the-art algorithms on two yeast PPI datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can not only find more protein complexes but also achieve higher accuracy in terms of fscore. Moreover, our approach can cover a certain number of proteins in the input PPI network in terms of the normalized clustering score. Taken together, our method can serve as a powerful framework to detect protein complexes in yeast PPI networks, thereby facilitating the identification of the underlying biological functions.",

Molecular docking studies indicated that all nine compounds presented one conformation in the ATP-binding site of HSP90α N-terminal domain.

Though scattered studies showed that repetitive elements in the regulatory regions of a gene control gene expression, no systematic survey has been done to report the characterization and distribution of various types of these repetitive elements in the human genome. Sequences from 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions and upstream and downstream of a gene were downloaded from the Ensembl database. The repetitive elements in the neighboring of each gene were identified and classified using cross-matching implemented in the RepeatMasker. The annotation and distribution of distinct classes of repetitive elements associated with individual gene were collected to characterize genes in association with different types of repetitive elements using systems biology program. We identified a total of 1,068,400 repetitive elements which belong to 37-class families and 1235 subclasses that are associated with 33,761 genes and 57,365 transcripts. In addition, we found that the tandem repeats preferentially locate proximal to the transcription start site (TSS) of genes and the major function of these genes are involved in developmental processes. On the other hand, interspersed repetitive elements showed a tendency to be accumulated at distal region from the TSS and the function of interspersed repeat-containing genes took part in the catabolic/metabolic processes. Results from the distribution analysis were collected and used to construct a gene-based repetitive element database (GBRED; http://www.binfo.ncku.edu.tw/GBRED/index.html). A user-friendly web interface was designed to provide the information of repetitive elements associated with any particular gene(s).This is the first study focusing on the gene-associated repetitive elements in the human genome.

     "abstract": "Advances in DNA sequencing technology over the past decade have increased the volume of raw sequenced genomic data available for further assembly and analysis. While there exist many algorithms for assembly of sequenced genomic material, they often experience difficulties in constructing complete genomic sequences. Instead, they produce long genomic subsequences (scaffolds), which then become a subject to scaffold assembly aimed at reconstruction of their order along genome chromosomes. The balance between reliability and cost for scaffold assembly is not there just yet, which inspires one to seek for new approaches to address this problem. We present a new method for scaffold assembly based on the analysis of gene orders and genome rearrangements in multiple related genomes (some or even all of which may be fragmented). Evaluation of the proposed method on artificially fragmented mammalian genomes demonstrates its high reliability. We also apply our method for incomplete anophelinae genomes, which expose high fragmentation, and further validate the assembly results with referenced-based scaffolding. While the two methods demonstrate consistent results, the proposed method is able to identify more assembly points than the reference-based scaffolding.",

     "abstract": "Gene expression profiles based on high-throughput technologies contribute to molecular classifications of different cell lines and consequently to clinical diagnostic tests for cancer types and other diseases. Statistical techniques and dimension reduction methods have been devised for identifying minimal gene subset with maximal discriminative power. For sets of in silico candidate genes, assuming a unique gene signature or performing a parsimonious signature evaluation seems to be too restrictive in the context of in vitro signature validation. This is mainly due to the high complexity of largely correlated expression measurements and the existence of various oncogenic pathways. Consequently, it might be more advantageous to identify and evaluate multiple gene signatures with a similar good predictive power, which are referred to as near-optimal signatures, to be made available for biological validation. For this purpose we propose the bead-chain-plot approach originating from swarm intelligence techniques, and a small scale computational experiment is conducted in order to convey our vision. We simulate the acquisition of candidate genes by using a small pool of differentially expressed genes derived from microarray-based CNS tumour data. The application of the bead-chain-plot provides experimental evidence for improved classifications by using near-optimal signatures in validation procedures.",

     "abstract": "The topology or shape of evolutionary trees and their unbalanced nature has been a long standing area of interest in the field of phylogenetics. Coevolutionary analysis, which considers the evolutionary relationships between a pair of phylogenetic trees, has to date not considered leveraging this unbalanced nature as a means to reduce the complexity of coevolutionary analysis. In this work we apply previous analyses of tree shapes to improve the efficiency of inferring coevolutionary events. In particular, we use this prior research to derive a new data structure for inferring coevolutionary histories. Our new data structure is proven to provide a reduction in the time and space required to infer coevolutionary events. It is integrated into an existing framework for coevolutionary analysis and has been validated using both synthetic and previously published biological data sets. This proposed data structure performs twice as fast as algorithms implemented using existing data structures with no degradation in the algorithm's accuracy. As the coevolutionary data sets increase in size so too does the running time reduction provided by the newly proposed data structure. This is due to our data structure offering a logarithmic time and space complexity improvement. As a result, the proposed update to existing coevolutionary analysis algorithms outlined herein should enable the inference of larger coevolutionary systems in the future.",

     "abstract": "RNA secondary structure prediction is a key technology in RNA bioinformatics. Most algorithms for RNA secondary structure prediction use probabilistic models, in which the model parameters are trained with reliable RNA secondary structures. Because of the difficulty of determining RNA secondary structures by experimental procedures, such as NMR or X-ray crystal structural analyses, there are still many RNA sequences that could be useful for training whose secondary structures have not been experimentally determined. In this paper, we introduce a novel semi-supervised learning approach for training parameters in a probabilistic model of RNA secondary structures in which we employ not only RNA sequences with annotated secondary structures but also ones with unknown secondary structures. Our model is based on a hybrid of generative (stochastic context-free grammars) and discriminative models (conditional random fields) that has been successfully applied to natural language processing. Computational experiments indicate that the accuracy of secondary structure prediction is improved by incorporating RNA sequences with unknown secondary structures into training. To our knowledge, this is the first study of a semi-supervised learning approach for RNA secondary structure prediction. This technique will be useful when the number of reliable structures is limited.",

     "abstract": "With full genome data from several closely related species now readily available, we have the ultimate data for demographic inference. Exploiting these full genomes, however, requires models that can explicitly model recombination along alignments of full chromosomal length. Over the last decade a class of models, based on the sequential Markov coalescence model combined with hidden Markov models, has been developed and used to make inference in simple demographic scenarios. To move forward to more complex demographic modelling we need better and more automated ways of specifying these models and efficient optimisation algorithms for inferring the parameters in complex and often high-dimensional models.In this paper we present a framework for building such coalescence hidden Markov models for pairwise alignments and present results for using heuristic optimisation algorithms for parameter estimation. We show that we can build more complex demographic models than our previous frameworks and that we obtain more accurate parameter estimates using heuristic optimisation algorithms than when using our previous gradient based approaches.Our new framework provides a flexible way of constructing coalescence hidden Markov models almost automatically. While estimating parameters in more complex models is still challenging we show that using heuristic optimisation algorithms we still get a fairly good accuracy.",

To study the diversity among bacteriocin encoding clusters and the putative bacteriocin precursors, genome mining was performed on 20 different species of LAB not reported to be bacteriocin producers. The phylogenetic tree of gyrB, rpoB, and 16S rRNA were constructed using MEGA6 software to analyze the diversity among strains. Putative bacteriocins operons identified were found to be diverse and were further characterized on the basis of physiochemical properties and the secondary structure. The presence of at least two cysteine residues in most of the observed putative bacteriocins leads to disulphide bond formation and provide stability.

Linear regression was performed to determine which of these parameters have a potentially significant contribution to the protein–ligand interaction. The parameters exhibiting relatively high correlation coefficients were selected. Important factors seem to be the number of ligand atoms, the ratio of N, O and S atoms to total ligand atoms, the hydrophobic/polar aminoacid ratio and the ratio of cavity size to the sum of ligand plus water atoms in the cavity. An important factor also seems to be the immobile water molecules in the cavity. Nine of these parameters were used as known inputs to train a neural network in the prediction of seven other. Eight structures were left out of the training to test the quality of the predictions.

The early stages of amyloid formation are of special interest due to the influence of this peptide on progression of AD. Here, we employed nine helices of undecapeptide Aβ13-23 and studied progress of amyloid formation using 500 ns molecular dynamics simulation and implicit membrane environment. The small β-sheets emerged very early during simulation as separated two-strand structures and a presence of the membrane facilitated this process. Later, the larger β-sheets were formed. However, the ninth helix which did not form paired structure stayed unchanged till the end of MD simulation.

     "abstract": "Cytochrome P450s are a superfamily of heme monooxygenases which catalyze a wide range of biochemical reactions. The reactions involve the introduction of an oxygen atom into an inactivated carbon of a compound which is essential to produce an intermediate of a hydroxylated product. The diversity of chemical reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P450s has led to their increased demand in numerous industrial and biotechnology applications. A recent study showed that a gene sequence encoding a CYP was found in the genome of Bacillus lehensis G1, and this gene shared structural similarity with the bacterial vitamin D hydroxylase (Vdh) from Pseudonocardia autotrophica. The objectives of present study was to mine, for a novel CYP from a new isolate B. lehensis G1 alkaliphile and determine the biological properties and functionalities of CYP in this bacterium. Our study employed the usage of computational methods to search for the novel CYP from CYP structural databases to identify the conserved pattern, functional domain and sequence properties of the uncharacterized CYP from B. lehensis G1. A computational homology model of the protein’s structure was generated and a docking analysis was performed to provide useful structural knowledge on the enzyme’s possible substrate and their interaction. Sequence analysis indicated that the newly identified CYP, termed CYP107CB2, contained the fingerprint heme binding sequence motif FxxGxxxCxG at position 336-345 as well as other highly conserved motifs characteristic of cytochrome P450 proteins. Using docking studies, we identified Ser-79, Leu-81, Val-231, Val-279, Val-383, Ala-232, Thr-236 and Thr-283 as important active site residues capable of stabilizing interactions with several potential substrates, including vitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3, in which all substrates docked proximally to the enzyme’s heme center. Biochemical analysis indicated that CYP107CB2 is a biologically active protein to produce 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 from 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3. Based on these results, we conclude that the novel CYP107CB2 identified from B. lehensis G1 is a putative vitamin D hydroxylase which is possibly capable of catalyzing the bioconversion of parental vitamin D3 to calcitriol, or related metabolic products.",

In a publicly available cDNA library we discovered an expressed sequence tag which translation generates a protein that perfectly matches both of the sequencing outputs described in the same paper. A further analysis indicated that the latter protein seems to belong to the vicilin superfamily rather than to the prolamin one. The fact that also vicilins are seed storage proteins known to be highly allergenic would explain the IgE reactivity originally observed.Based on our observations we suggest that the IgE reactive 12 kDa protein from almond currently known as Pru du 2S albumin is in reality the cleaved N-terminal region of a 7S vicilin like protein.",

In protein–protein interaction networks, hubs involve in numbers of PPIs and may constitute an important source of drug targets. The intrinsic disorder proteins (IDPs) with unstable structures can promote the promiscuity of hubs and also involve in many disease pathways, so they also could serve as potential drug targets. Moreover, proteins with similar functions measured by semantic similarity of gene ontology (GO) terms tend to interact with each other. Here, the relationship between hub proteins and drug targets based on GO terms and intrinsic disorder was explored. The semantic similarities of GO terms and genes between two proteins, and the rate of intrinsic disorder residues of each protein were extracted as features to characterize the functional similarity between two interacting proteins. Only using 8 feature variables, prediction models by support vector machine (SVM) were constructed to predict PPIs. The accuracy of the model on the PPI data from human hub proteins is as high as 83.72%, which is very promising compared with other PPI prediction models with hundreds or even thousands of features. Then, 118 of 142 PPIs between hubs are correctly predicted that the two interacting proteins are targets of the same drugs. The results indicate that only 8 functional features are fully efficient for representing PPIs. In order to identify new targets from IDP dataset, the PPIs between hubs and IDPs are predicted by the SVM model and the model yields a prediction accuracy of 75.84%. Further research proves that 3 of 5 PPIs between hubs and IDPs are correctly predicted that the two interacting proteins are targets of the same drugs. All results demonstrate that the model with only 8-dimensional features from GO terms and intrinsic disorder still gives a good performance in predicting PPIs and further identifying drug targets.",

We also compared the combination of mRMR with GA (mRMR-GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (mRMR-PSO) algorithms. In addition, we compared the GBC algorithm with other related algorithms that have been recently published in the literature, using all benchmark datasets. The GBC algorithm shows superior performance as it achieved the highest classification accuracy along with the lowest average number of selected genes. This proves that the GBC algorithm is a promising approach for solving the gene selection problem in both binary and multi-class cancer classification.",

The free energy profiles for the reaction in the apo-enzyme and in an enzyme – substrate complex have been obtained. In the apo-enzyme, the two catalytic residues are chemically equivalent and are expected to be both unprotonated.

Based on better q2 and r2pred values, the best predictions were obtained for the CoMFA (model 5 q2 = 0.488, r2pred = 0.732), and CoMSIA (model 45 q2 = 0.525, r2pred = 0.883) from systematic search conformation alignment. The high correlation between the cross-validated/predicted and experimental activities of a test set revealed that the CoMFA and CoMSIA models were robust. Statistical parameters from the generated QSAR models indicated the data is well fitted and have high predictive ability. The generated models suggest that steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, H-bond donor and acceptor parameters are important for activity. Our study serves as a guide for further experimental investigations on the synthesis of new CRTh2 antagonist.",

In total, in the 10 species we discussed, the PGQMs densities in monocots were higher than dicots. 40,483 and 31,795 PGQMs were identified with a density of 108.46 and 84.89 PGQMs/Mb, respectively, in japonica and indica genomes, 10,655 and 5420 loci were found to contain at least one PGQM in their gene bodies (with a percentage of 19% and 14%) indicating a wide distribution of G-quadruplex motifs in O. sativa genome. They preferred to locate in transcription start sites proximal regions and 5′-UTR with relative high enrichment. This phenomenon supports the hypothesis that PGQMs are involved in gene transcription and translation. In addition, we analyzed the distribution of different loop length in G-quadruplex and found the density of long loop PGQMs was less than short loop in indica’s intron but it was similar in japonica. Meanwhile, we focused on the loci with PGQMs and conducted gene ontology (GO) analysis of them. As a result, many GO terms were identified and significantly correlated with the loci containing at least one PGQM. The GO analysis in the two subspecies of rice may be helpful for elucidating the functional roles of G-quadruplexes.",

The five motifs define five distinct ATP–protein interaction modes which concern over 5% of known protein structures. We demonstrate that although these motifs share a common GXG tripeptide they recognize ATP through different functional groups. The p-loop motif recognizes ATP through phosphates, class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase motif targets adenosine and the other three motifs recognize both phosphates and adenosine. We show that some motifs are shared by different enzyme types. Statistical tests demonstrate that the five sequence motifs are significantly associated with the nucleotide binding proteins. Large-scale test on PDB reveals that about 98% of proteins that include one of the structural motifs are confirmed to bind ATP.",

They are very useful to understand the different complex biological processes that may occur in living organisms. Currently, one of the biggest challenge in any study related with GN is to assure the quality of these GNs. In this sense, recent works use artificial data sets or a direct comparison with prior biological knowledge. However, these approaches are not entirely accurate as they only take into account direct gene–gene interactions for validation, leaving aside the weak (indirect) relationships.We propose a new measure, named gene network coherence (GNC), to rate the coherence of an input network according to different biological databases. In this sense, the measure considers not only the direct gene–gene relationships but also the indirect ones to perform a complete and fairer evaluation of the input network. Hence, our approach is able to use the whole information stored in the networks. A GNC JAVA-based implementation is available at: http://fgomezvela.github.io/GNC/.The results achieved in this work show that GNC outperforms the classical approaches for assessing GNs by means of three different experiments using different biological databases and input networks. According to the results, we can conclude that the proposed measure, which considers the inherent information stored in the direct and indirect gene–gene relationships, offers a new robust solution to the problem of GNs biological validation.",

Mathematical simulation by means of reliable and predictive models represents an important tool to interpret experiment results, to facilitate the definition of the optimal operating conditions for in vitro cultivation, or to predict the effect of a specific drug in normal/pathologic mammalian cells. Along these lines, a novel model of cell cycle progression is proposed in this work. Specifically, it is based on a population balance (PB) approach that allows one to quantitatively describe cell cycle progression through the different phases experienced by each cell of the entire population during its own life. The transition between two consecutive cell cycle phases is simulated by taking advantage of the biochemical kinetic model developed by Gérard and Goldbeter (2009) which involves cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) whose regulation is achieved through a variety of mechanisms that include association with cyclins and protein inhibitors, phosphorylation–dephosphorylation, and cyclin synthesis or degradation. This biochemical model properly describes the entire cell cycle of mammalian cells by maintaining a sufficient level of detail useful to identify check point for transition and to estimate phase duration required by PB. Specific examples are discussed to illustrate the ability of the proposed model to simulate the effect of drugs for in vitro trials of interest in oncology, regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.",

Nefiracetam reportedly boosts NMDA receptor functions as a basis for its nootropic properties. Previous studies suggest that nefiracetam potentiates the NMDA receptor activation, as a more potent co-agonist for glycine binding site than glycine, though the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, using BSP-SLIM method, a novel binding site within the core of spiral β-strands-1-5 of LBD-GLUN1 has been predicted in glycine-bound GLUN1 conformation in addition to the glycine pocket in Apo-GLUN1. Within the core of spiral β-strands-1-5 of LBD-GLUN1 pocket, all-atom molecular dynamics simulation revealed that nefiracetam disrupts Arg523-glycine-Asp732 interaction resulting in open GLUN1 conformation and ultimate diffusion of glycine out of the clamshell cleft. Open GLUN1 conformation coerces other intra-chain domains and proximal inter-chain domains to sample inactivate conformations resulting in closure of the transmembrane gate via a novel gauche trap on threonine 647 (chi-1 dihedral (χ1) = −45° instead of +45°). Docking of nefiracetam into the glycine pocket reversed the gauche trap and meditates partial opening of the TMD gate within a time-scale of 100 ns as observed in glycine-only state. All these results suggest that nefiracetam can favorably complete with glycine for GLUN1-LBD in a two-step process, first by binding to a novel site of GLUN1-LBD-NMDA receptor followed by disruption of glycine-binding dynamics then replacing glycine in the GLUN1-LBD cleft.",

The method first computes the amino acid compositional index from the protein sequence dataset of domain-linker segments and the amino acid composition. A preference profile is then generated by calculating the average compositional index values along the amino acid sequence using a sliding window. Finally, the protein sequence is segmented into intervals and a simulated annealing algorithm is employed to enhance the prediction by finding the optimal threshold value for each segment that separates domains from inter-domain linkers. The method was tested on two standard protein datasets and showed considerable improvement over the state-of-the-art domain linker prediction methods.",

However, the experimental identification of a miR to be associated with cancer is still an elaborate, time-consuming process. To aid this process of miR association, we undertook an in-silico study involving the identification of global signatures in experimentally validated microRNAs associated with cancer. Subsequently, a support vector machine based two-step binary classifier system has been trained and modeled from the features extracted from the above study. A total of 60 distinguishing features were selected and ranked to form the feature set for classification – 26 of these extracted from the miR sequence itself, and the remainder from the thermodynamics of folding and the hybridized miRNA–mRNA structure.

In this study we identified the potential ligandable sites of the active cholera toxin which can serve as binding sites for drug-like molecules. By employing an energy-based approach to identify ligand binding sites, and comparison with the results of computational solvent mapping, we identified two potential ligandable sites in the active toxin which can be targeted during structure-based drug design against cholera. Based on the probe affinities of the identified ligandable regions, docking-based virtual screening was employed to identify probable inhibitors against these sites. Several indole-based alkaloids and phosphates showed strong interactions to the important residues of the ligandable region at the A1 active site. On the other hand, 26 top scoring hits were identified against the ligandable region at the A1 ARF6 interface which showed strong hydrogen bonding interactions, including guanidines, phosphates, Leucopterin and Aristolochic acid VIa. This study has important implications in the application of hybrid structure-based and ligand-based methods against the identified ligandable sites using the identified inhibitors as reference ligands, for drug design against the active cholera toxin.",

In this study, we have carried out a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis constructing neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood trees based on various statistical methods of different ABC protein subfamily of five plant lineages including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (green algae), Physcomitrella patens (moss), Selaginella moellendorffii (lycophyte), Arabidopsis thaliana (dicot) and O. sativa (monocot) to explore the origin and evolutionary patterns of these ABC genes. We have identified several conserved motifs in nucleotide binding domain (NBD) of ABC proteins among all plant lineages during evolution. Amongst the different ABC protein subfamilies, ‘ABCE’ has not yet been identified in lower plant genomes (algae, moss and lycophytes). The result indicated that gene duplication and diversification process acted upon these genes as a major operative force creating new groups and subgroups and functional divergence during evolution. We have demonstrated that rice ABCI subfamily consists of only half size transporters that represented highly dynamic members showing maximum sequence variations among the other rice ABC subfamilies. The evolutionary and the expression analysis contribute to a deep insight into the evolution and diversity of rice ABC proteins and their roles in response to salt stress that facilitate our further understanding on rice ABC transporters.",

Geometry-optimised tri-peptide structures in extended solvent-exposed reference conformations have been obtained for 43 amino acid residue types at a high level of quantum chemical theory. Significant increases in side-chain solvent accessibility, offset by reductions in main-chain atom solvent exposure, were observed for standard residue types in partially geometry-optimised structures when compared to non-minimised models built from identical sets of proper dihedral angles abstracted from the literature. Optimisation of proper dihedral angles led most notably to marked increases of up to 54% in proline main-chain atom solvent accessibility compared to literature values. Similar effects were observed for fully-optimised tri-peptides in implicit solvent. The relief of internal strain energy was associated with systematic variation in N, Cα and Cβ atom solvent accessibility across all standard residue types. The results underline the importance of optimisation of ‘hard’ degrees of freedom (bond lengths and valence bond angles) and improper dihedral angle values from force field or other context-independent reference values, and impact on the use of standardised fixed internal co-ordinate geometry in sampling approaches to the determination of absolute values of protein amino acid residue solvent accessibility.

Identification of motifs controlling polyadenylation plays an essential role in improving genome annotation accuracy and better understanding of the mechanisms governing gene regulation. The bioinformatics methods used for poly(A) motifs recognition have demonstrated that information extracted from sequences surrounding the candidate motifs can differentiate true motifs from the false ones greatly. However, these methods depend on either domain features or string kernels. To date, methods combining information from different sources have not been found yet. Here, we proposed an improved poly(A) motifs recognition method by combing different sources based on decision level fusion. First of all, two novel prediction methods was proposed based on support vector machine (SVM): one method is achieved by using the domain-specific features and principle component analysis (PCA) method to eliminate the redundancy (PCA–SVM); the other method is based on Oligo string kernel (Oligo-SVM). Then we proposed a novel machine-learning method for poly(A) motif prediction by marrying four poly(A) motifs recognition methods, including two state-of-the-art methods (Random Forest (RF) and HMM-SVM), and two novel proposed methods (PCA–SVM and Oligo-SVM). A decision level information fusion method was employed to combine the decision values of different classifiers by applying the DS evidence theory. We evaluated our method on a comprehensive poly(A) dataset that consists of 14,740 samples on 12 variants of poly(A) motifs and 2750 samples containing none of these motifs. Our method has achieved accuracy up to 86.13%. Compared with the four classifiers, our evidence theory based method reduces the average error rate by about 30%, 27%, 26% and 16%, respectively.

Here, considering that there are various kinase inhibitors being approved or under clinical or preclinical development, it is expected that some of them can be re-exploited as new potent agents to target mTOR for glioblastoma therapy. To achieve this, a synthetic pipeline that integrated molecular grafting, consensus scoring, virtual screening, kinase assay and structure analysis was described to systematically profile the binding potency of various small-molecule inhibitors deposited in the protein kinase–inhibitor database against the kinase domain of mTOR. Consequently, a number of structurally diverse compounds were successfully identified to exhibit satisfactory inhibition profile against mTOR with IC50 values at nanomolar level. In particular, few sophisticated kinase–inhibitors as well as a flavonoid myricetin showed high inhibitory activities, which could thus be considered as potential lead compounds to develop new potent, selective mTOR–inhibitors. Structural examination revealed diverse nonbonded interactions such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic forces and van der Waals contacts across the complex interface of mTOR with myricetin, conferring both stability and specificity for the mTOR–inhibitor binding.",

The mutant Gly25Glu of BAF2 was manually constructed to explore the detailed effect of the mutation on the binding of BAF2 and EmLEM. It has been experimentally suggested that point mutation Gly25Glu can disturb the binding between BAF2 and EmLEM. Then, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on DNA2:BAF2(WT):EmLEM and DNA2:BAF2(MT):EmLEM complexes. 30 ns trajectories revealed that the trajectory fluctuations of MT complex are more violent than that of the WT complex. Further, the binding free energy analysis showed that the electronegative residues Asp57, Glu61 and Asp65 from chain A, glu36 from chain B of BAF2 mainly contribute to interact with EmLEM. Besides, a stable π–π stack between trp62 and phe39 from BAF2(WT) chain B is destroyed by Glu25 in BAF2(MT). As a result, trp62 forms an interaction with glu25, and phe39 converts to strengthen affinity to EmLEM. On the other hand, Trp62 from chain A also forms a strong interaction with MT Glu25. Thus, with the docking of DNA, BAF2(MT) has higher affinity with EmLEM than BAF2(WT).",

     "abstract": "Many structural centrality measures were proposed to predict putative disease genes on biological networks. Closeness is one of the best-known structural centrality measures, and its effectiveness for disease gene prediction on undirected biological networks has been frequently reported. However, it is not clear whether closeness is effective for disease gene prediction on directed biological networks such as signaling networks.In this paper, we first show that closeness does not significantly outperform other well-known centrality measures such as Degree, Betweenness, and PageRank for disease gene prediction on a human signaling network. In addition, we observed that prediction accuracy by the closeness measure was worse than that by a reachability measure, but closeness could efficiently predict disease genes among a set of genes with the same reachability value. Based on this observation, we devised a novel structural measure, hierarchical closeness, by combining reachability and closeness such that all genes are first ranked by the degree of reachability and then the tied genes are further ranked by closeness. We discovered that hierarchical closeness outperforms other structural centrality measures in disease gene prediction. We also found that the set of highly ranked genes in terms of hierarchical closeness is clearly different from that of hub genes with high connectivity. More interestingly, these findings were consistently reproduced in a random Boolean network model. Finally, we found that genes with relatively high hierarchical closeness are significantly likely to encode proteins in the extracellular matrix and receptor proteins in a human signaling network, supporting the fact that half of all modern medicinal drugs target receptor-encoding genes.Taken together, hierarchical closeness proposed in this study is a novel structural measure to efficiently predict putative disease genes in a directed signaling network.",

In this paper, we propose a new cascading model to investigate the basis for psychrophilicity. In this model, a superior classifier was used to discriminate psychrophilic from mesophilic protein sequences, and then the PART rule generating algorithm was applied on the input instances that are correctly classified by the classifier, to generate human interpretable rules. These derived rules were further validated on a structural dataset and finally analyzed to discover the underlying biological basis about the psychrophilicity. In this study, we have used one of the key features of psychrophilic proteins accountable for remaining functional in extreme cold temperature surroundings i.e., global patterns of amino acid composition as the input features. The rotation forest classifier outperformed all the other classifiers with maximum accuracy of 70.5% and maximum AUC of 0.78. The effect of sequence length on the classification accuracy was also investigated.

In the present research, we identified three potato novel miR159 family members named as stu-miR159a, stu-miR159b and stu-miR159c based on bioinformatics analysis. Target prediction showed that they have a bite sit on the three GAMyb-like genes (StGAMyb-like1, StGAMyb-like2.1 and StGAMyb-like2.2) of potato. Those GAMyb-like genes also have been selected and cloned from potato, which belong to R2R3 MYB domain TFs. We further measured expressional levels of stu-miR159s and potato GAMyb-like genes during the different periods of drought treated samples using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The results showed that they had a opposite expression pattern, briefly, three stu-miR159 members showed similar expressional trends which were significantly decreased expression after experiencing 25 days of drought stress treatment, while the potato GAMyb-like family members were greatly increased. Therefore, we suggested that stu-miR159s negatively regulated the expression of potato GAMyb-like genes which responsible for drought stress.

Any discrepancy in apoptosis may trigger testicular and neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic damage, autoimmune disorders and many types of cancer. Tcte3 (T-complex testis expressed 3) is an accessory component of axonemal and cytoplasmic dynein which expresses predominantly in meiotic and postmeiotic germ cells. It plays an essential role during spermatogenesis; however, to explore its diverse and complex functioning in male germ cell apoptosis, requires further prosecution. Here, 2D-gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and qRT–PCR analyses were performed to elucidate the differential expression of genes, in both wild-type and homozygous Tcte3-3 mice. We observed an increased expression of Tcte3 in homozygotes as compared to wild-type testes. Perpetually, an increased expression of Anxa5 and Pebp1, while a lower expression of Rsph1 was detected in Tcte3-3−/− mice. We propose that over-expression of Pebp1 and Anxa5 in Tcte3-3−/− testes might be due to increased apoptosis. To evaluate this possibility, testes specific microarray data set extracted from NCBI gene ontology omnibus (GEO) was used to cluster the possible co-expression partners of Tcte3. Further functional coherence of compiled candidate genes was monitored computationally by studying the common TFBS overlapped at the regulatory regions. Differential expression of Tcte3-3 and its involvement in apoptosis may provide a basis for the investigation of transcriptional specificities of other Tcte3 paralogs (Tcte3-1 and Tcte3-2). A complete understanding of controlling factors which have implications in regulating tissue-specific Tcte3 expression would provide additional insights into the gene control events. The collective knowledge may prove useful for the development of novel therapeutic regimen and would open new avenues in defining selective roles of Tcte3 in germ cell development.",

Both porins have the extracellular loop L3 folded halfway through the pore to form a constriction area. The solute influx and efflux are controlled by the L3 movement. E296 and D312 in OmpF and homologous D299 and D315 in OmpC located on the barrel wall are found to play a key role in L3 gating activity. All possible charged states of both E296(D299) and D312(315) are applied in this study to observe changes in overall structure and especially L3 movement. The results show that different protonation states of both residues cause the large-scale deviations in structure and pore cavity especially in OmpF. Fully charged E296(D299) and D312(315) increase the protein flexibility significantly. Deprotonating at least one of E296(D299) and D312(315) helps to fasten L3 to the barrel wall and maintain pore size. Lacking of interactions with D312(315) can lead to the pore closure in OmpF.

Disregulation in apoptosis may lead autoimmunity or cancer, but increased apoptosis can lead degenerative diseases. Studies during the last several years have identified numerous affected miRNAs in association with apoptosis, their target genes and biological functions, and possible drug interventions. Polymorphisms in miRNA genes or miRNA target sites (miRSNPs) can modify miRNA action. While polymorphisms in miRNA genes are relatively rare, SNPs in miRNA-binding sites in target genes are more frequent. Several studies have shown that SNPs in miRNA target sites enhance or weaken the interaction between miRNA and its target transcripts and are associated with cancers and other diseases. We aimed to identify miRSNPs on executioner caspase, CASP3 gene (caspase-3) and SNPs in miRNA genes targeting 3′UTR of CASP3 and assessing the impact of these miRSNPs and SNPs of miRNA genes targeting 3′UTR of CASP3 with respect to apoptosis. We identified 89 different miRNA binding sites (for 43 different miRNAs) and 16 different SNPs in binding sites of miRNA in the 3′UTR of the CASP3 gene. Also, 2 SNPs (rs372435266 and rs190144655) were found on this miRNA′ genomic sequence. One of them crossmatched with a SNP in the 3′UTR of CASP3 that we found formerly. This miRNA was miR-4802-3p. Besides, miR-4802-3p targets three other apoptosis related genes, XIAP, IL1A and SOX2. This means that miR-4802-3p may also have a critical effect on apoptosis via different pathways other than caspase-3. We can therefore conclude that this is the first study proving a strong association between miR-4802-3p and apoptosis upon computational targetting analysis.",

Our analysis suggests that the hypothesis of an early proto-Eukaryote could be valid.

Our evolutionary analysis needs to be extended by building metabolic network reconstructions of species from the phylum Crenarchaeota, which is considered to be a possible archaeal ancestor of the eukaryotic cell.

     "abstract": "Dengue virus can ignite both protective and pathogenic responses in human. The pathogenesis is related with modified functioning of our immune system during infection. Pattern recognition receptors like Toll like receptor 3 is vital for the induction of innate immunity in case of Dengue infection. Toll like receptor 3 induces TRIF mediated activation of Type 1 interferons and Fc receptor mediated induction of cytokines. Interferons have been related with clearance of Dengue virus but it has adopted modified regulatory mechanisms to counter this effect. SOCS protein is also induced due to the interferon and cytokine mediated signalling which can subsequently play its part in the regulation of interferon and cytokine production. Our hypothesis in this study relates the pathogenesis of Dengue virus with the SOCS mediated inhibition of our innate immunity. We used the qualitative formalism of René Thomas to model the biological regulatory network of Toll like receptor 3 mediated signalling pathway in an association with pathogenesis of dengue. Logical parameters for the qualitative modelling were inferred using a model checking approach implemented in SMBioNet. A linear hybrid model, parametric linear hybrid automaton, was constructed to incorporate the activation and inhibition time delays in the qualitative model. The qualitative model captured all the possible expression dynamics of the proteins in the form of paths, some of which were observed as abstract cycles (representing homoeostasis) and diverging paths towards stable states. The analysis of the qualitative model highlighted the importance of SOCS protein in elevating propagation of dengue virus through inhibition of type 1 interferons. Detailed qualitative analysis of regulatory network endorses our hypothesis that elevated levels of cytokine subsequently induce SOCS expression which in turn results into the continuous down-regulation of Toll like receptor 3 and interferon. This may result into the Dengue pathogenesis during the stage of immunosuppression. Further analysis with HyTech (HYbrid TECHnology) tool provided us with the real-time constraints (delay constraints) of the proteins involved in the cyclic paths of the regulatory network backing the evidence provided by the qualitative analysis. The HyTech results also suggest that the role of SOCS is vital in homoeostasis.",

The S-system is a dynamic and structurally rich model that determines the net strength of interactions between genes and/or proteins. Good generation characteristics without the need for prior information have allowed S-systems to become one of the most promising canonical models. Various evolutionary computation technologies have recently been developed for the identification of system parameters and skeletal-network structures. However, the gaps between the truncated and preserved terms remain too small. Additionally, current research methods fail to identify the structures of high dimensional systems (e.g., 30 genes with 1800 connections). Optimization technologies should converge fast and have the ability to adaptively adjust the search. In this study, we propose a seeding-inspired chemotaxis genetic algorithm (SCGA) that can force evolution to adjust the population movement to identify a favorable location. The seeding-inspired training strategy is a method to achieve optimal results with limited resources. SCGA introduces seeding-inspired genetic operations to allow a population to possess competitive power (exploitation and exploration) and a winner-chemotaxis-induced population migration to force a population to repeatedly tumble away from an attractor and swim toward another attractor. SCGA was tested on several canonical biological systems. SCGA not only learned the correct structure within only one to three pruning steps but also ensures pruning safety. The values of the truncated terms were all smaller than 10−14, even for a thirty-gene system.",

In this study, we proposed a novel approach for binding sites identification in proteins, which not only integrates local features and global features from protein sequence directly, but also constructed a balanced training dataset using sub-sampling based on submodularity subset selection. Firstly we extracted local features and global features from protein sequence, such as evolution information and molecule weight. Secondly, the number of non-interaction sites is much more than interaction sites, which leads to a sample imbalance problem, and hence biased machine learning model with preference to non-interaction sites. To better resolve this problem, instead of previous randomly sub-sampling over-represented non-interaction sites, a novel sampling approach based on submodularity subset selection was employed, which can select more representative data subset. Finally random forest were trained on optimally selected training subsets to predict interaction sites. Our result showed that our proposed method is very promising for predicting protein–RNA interaction residues, it achieved an accuracy of 0.863, which is better than other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, it also indicated the extracted global features have very strong discriminate ability for identifying interaction residues from random forest feature importance analysis.",

The comparisons are undertaken using the full four-letter alphabet and the coarse grained two-letter alphabets AG-CT and AT-CG. We show that the conditional probability matrix for the four-letter and AT-CG alphabet is markedly asymmetric in eukaryotes while it is nearly symmetric in bacterial genomes. Spatial asymmetry is revealed in the four-letter alphabet, signifying that the probability fluxes are nonvanishing and thus the reading sense of a sequence is irreversible for all organisms. Calculations of the block entropy and excess entropy demonstrate that the human genome accommodates better all possible block configurations, especially for long blocks. With respect to point-to-point details and to spatial arrangement of blocks the exit distance distributions from a particular letter demonstrate long distance characteristics in the eukaryotic sequences for all three alphabets, while the bacterial (prokaryotic) genomes deviate indicating short range characteristics. Overall, the conditional probability, the fluxes, the block entropy content and the exit distance distributions can be used as markers, discriminating between eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA, allowing in many cases to discern details related to finer classes. In all cases the reduction from four letters to two masks some important statistical and spatial properties, with the AT-CG alphabet having higher ability of discrimination than the AG-CT one. In particular, the AT-CG alphabet reduction accentuates the CpG related properties (conditional probabilities w 32 , long ranged exit distance distribution for A and T nucleotides), but masks sequence asymmetry and irreversibility in all examined organisms.",

     "abstract": "We examine the relationship between exponential correlation functions and Markov models in a bacterial genome in detail. Despite the well known fact that Markov models generate sequences with correlation function that decays exponentially, simply constructed Markov models based on nearest-neighbor dimer (first-order), trimer (second-order), up to hexamer (fifth-order), and treating the DNA sequence as being homogeneous all fail to predict the value of exponential decay rate. Even reading-frame-specific Markov models (both first- and fifth-order) could not explain the fact that the exponential decay is very slow. Starting with the in-phase coding-DNA-sequence (CDS), we investigated correlation within a fixed-codon-position subsequence, and in artificially constructed sequences by packing CDSs with out-of-phase spacers, as well as altering CDS length distribution by imposing an upper limit. From these targeted analyses, we conclude that the correlation in the bacterial genomic sequence is mainly due to a mixing of heterogeneous statistics at different codon positions, and the decay of correlation is due to the possible out-of-phase between neighboring CDSs. There are also small contributions to the correlation from bases at the same codon position, as well as by non-coding sequences. These show that the seemingly simple exponential correlation functions in bacterial genome hide a complexity in correlation structure which is not suitable for a modeling by Markov chain in a homogeneous sequence. Other results include: use of the (absolute value) second largest eigenvalue to represent the 16 correlation functions and the prediction of a 10–11 base periodicity from the hexamer frequencies.",

In the presence of limited sequence length, LRC chain can be approximated by a high order Markov chain. For the order estimation, the parametric significance test of conditional mutual information IC(m) is applied, found in an earlier work to be suitable for high order estimation. Here, it is computationally optimized applying an iterative algorithm for calculating IC(m) at increasing order m, enabling the analysis of long symbol sequences of high Markov chain order or LRC. The simulation study shows that when the true order is reasonably small, the estimated order saturates at the true order with the increase of the symbol sequence length, while when the true order is very large or the chain has LRC, the estimated order increases logarithmically with the symbol sequence length. The order estimation shows a different dependence on the DNA sequence length for bacteria, the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the human chromosome, indicating a different long memory structure in their DNA.",

In this work, we investigated the possibility of finding the true period length, by depending on the average number of accumulated changes in DNA bases (PM) for the methods stated above. The results show that for periods with short length (≤4 b.p), it is possible to use the hybrid method (HYB), which combines properties of autocorrelation, Fourier transform, and information decomposition (ID). For larger period lengths (>4) with values of point mutation (PM) equal to 1.0 or more per one nucleotide, it is preferable to use information of decomposition method (ID), as the other spectral approaches cannot achieve correct determination of the period length present in the analyzed sequence.",

     "abstract": "Transfer of nucleotide strings in the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 genome is investigated to exhibit periodic and non-periodic correlation structures by using the recurrence plot method and the phase space reconstruction technique. The periodic correlation structures are generated by periodic transfer of several substrings in long periodic or non-periodic nucleotide strings embedded in the coding regions of genes. The non-periodic correlation structures are generated by non-periodic transfer of several substrings covering or overlapping with the coding regions of genes. In the periodic and non-periodic transfer, some gaps divide the long nucleotide strings into the substrings and prevent their global transfer. Most of the gaps are either the replacement of one base or the insertion/reduction of one base. In the reconstructed phase space, the points generated from two or three steps for the continuous iterative transfer via the second maximal distance can be fitted by two lines. It partly reveals an intrinsic dynamics in the transfer of nucleotide strings. Due to the comparison of the relative positions and lengths, the substrings concerned with the non-periodic correlation structures are almost identical to the mobile elements annotated in the genome. The mobile elements are thus endowed with the basic results on the correlation structures.",

     "abstract": "Early global measures of genome complexity (power spectra, the analysis of fluctuations in DNA walks or compositional segmentation) uncovered a high degree of complexity in eukaryotic genome sequences. The main evolutionary mechanisms leading to increases in genome complexity (i.e. gene duplication and transposon proliferation) can all potentially produce increases in DNA clustering. To quantify such clustering and provide a genome-wide description of the formed clusters, we developed GenomeCluster, an algorithm able to detect clusters of whatever genome element identified by chromosome coordinates. We obtained a detailed description of clusters for ten categories of human genome elements, including functional (genes, exons, introns), regulatory (CpG islands, TFBSs, enhancers), variant (SNPs) and repeat (Alus, LINE1) elements, as well as DNase hypersensitivity sites. For each category, we located their clusters in the human genome, then quantifying cluster length and composition, and estimated the clustering level as the proportion of clustered genome elements. In average, we found a 27% of elements in clusters, although a considerable variation occurs among different categories. Genes form the lowest number of clusters, but these are the longest ones, both in bp and the average number of components, while the shortest clusters are formed by SNPs. Functional and regulatory elements (genes, CpG islands, TFBSs, enhancers) show the highest clustering level, as compared to DNase sites, repeats (Alus, LINE1) or SNPs. Many of the genome elements we analyzed are known to be composed of clusters of low-level entities. In addition, we found here that the clusters generated by GenomeCluster can be in turn clustered into high-level super-clusters. The observation of ‘clusters-within-clusters’ parallels the ‘domains within domains’ phenomenon previously detected through global statistical methods in eukaryotic sequences, and reveals a complex human genome landscape dominated by hierarchical clustering.",

However, such an analysis ignores the important spatial information, which is important with regards to the mutation occurrence statistics. In this work, we propose that the study of the distribution of distances between consecutive mutations along the DNA molecule can provide information about the types of somatic mutational processes. In particular, we have found that specific cancer types show a power-law in interoccurrence distances, instead of the expected exponential distribution dictated with the Poisson assumption commonly made in the literature. Cancer genomes exhibiting power-law interoccurrence distances were enriched in cancer types where the main mutational process is described to be the activity of the APOBEC protein family, which produces a particular pattern of mutations called Kataegis. Therefore, the observation of a power-law in interoccurence distances could be used to identify cancer genomes with Kataegis.",

In both cases power-law-like linearity in double logarithmic scale is found. An evolutionary model, initially put forward for the explanation of a similar pattern found in gene populations is implemented. It includes segmental duplication events and eliminations of most of the duplicated CGIs, while a moderate rate of non-duplicated CGI eliminations is also applied in some cases. Simulations reproduce all the main features of the observed inter-CGI chromosomal size distributions. Our results on power-law-like linearity found in orphan CGI populations suggest that the observed distributional pattern is independent of the analogous pattern that protein coding segments were reported to follow. The power-law-like patterns in the genomic distributions of CGIs described herein are found to be compatible with several other features of the composition, abundance or functional role of CGIs reported in the current literature across several genomes, on the basis of the proposed evolutionary model.",

     "abstract": "Selecting the values of parameters used by de novo genomic assembly programs, or choosing an optimal de novo assembly from several runs obtained with different parameters or programs, are tasks that can require complex decision-making. A key parameter that must be supplied to typical next generation sequencing (NGS) assemblers is the k-mer length, i.e., the word size that determines which de Bruijn graph the program should map out and use. The topic of assembly selection criteria was recently revisited in the Assemblathon 2 study (Bradnam et al., 2013). Although no clear message was delivered with regard to optimal k-mer lengths, it was shown with examples that it is sometimes important to decide if one is most interested in optimizing the sequences of protein-coding genes (the gene space) or in optimizing the whole genome sequence including the intergenic DNA, as what is best for one criterion may not be best for the other. In the present study, our aim was to better understand how the assembly of unicellular fungi (which are typically intermediate in size and complexity between prokaryotes and metazoan eukaryotes) can change as one varies the k-mer values over a wide range. We used two different de novo assembly programs (SOAPdenovo2 and ABySS), and simple assembly metrics that also focused on success in assembling the gene space and repetitive elements. A recent increase in Illumina read length to around 150 bp allowed us to attempt de novo assemblies with a larger range of k-mers, up to 127 bp. We applied these methods to Illumina paired-end sequencing read sets of fungal strains of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and other species. By visualizing the results in simple plots, we were able to track the effect of changing k-mer size and assembly program, and to demonstrate how such plots can readily reveal discontinuities or other unexpected characteristics that assembly programs can present in practice, especially when they are used in a traditional molecular microbiology laboratory with a ‘genomics corner’. Here we propose and apply a component of a first pass validation methodology for benchmarking and understanding fungal genome de novo assembly processes.",

Notably, some of these regions overlap units with important biological functions, including 4% of protein-coding genes.

The noncoding phase and the six coding phases are described by two frequency tables of the 64 triplet types or ‘codon usages’. A set of codon usages can be used to update the phase assignment and vice versa. An iteration after an initialization leads to a convergent phase assignment to give an annotation of the genome. In the extension of the approach to a metagenome, we consider a mixture model of a number of categories described by different codon usages. The Illumina Genome Analyzer sequencing data of the total DNA from faecal samples are then examined to understand the diversity of the human gut microbiome.",

At the smallest spatial scales, interatomic forces dictate the folding and function of proteins and nucleic acids. On longer length scales, stochastic forces emerging from the thermal jiggling of proteins and RNAs impose strong constraints on the organization of genes along chromosomes, more particularly in the context of the building of nucleoprotein complexes and the operational mode of regulatory agents. At the cellular level, transcription, replication and cell division activities generate forces that act on both the internal structure and cellular location of chromosomes. The overall result is a complex multi-scale organization of genomes that reflects the evolutionary tinkering of bacteria. The goal of this review is to highlight avenues for deciphering this complexity by focusing on patterns that are conserved among evolutionarily distant bacteria. To this end, I discuss three different organizational scales: the protein structures, the chromosomal organization of genes and the global structure of chromosomes.",

We herein perform a detailed analysis of this property in the complete exon set of the mouse genome in correlation to the sequence conservation of each exon and the transcriptional complexity of each gene locus. We show that extensive linear fits, representative of accordance to Menzerath–Altmann law are restricted to a particular subset of genes that are formed by exons under low or intermediate sequence constraints and have a small number of alternative transcripts. Based on this observation we propose a hypothesis for the law of Menzerath–Altmann in mammalian genes being predominantly due to genes that are more versatile in function and thus, more prone to undergo changes in their structure. To this end we demonstrate one test case where gene categories of different functionality also show differences in the extent of conformity to Menzerath–Altmann law.",

     "abstract": "Besides their large-scale organization in isochores, mammalian genomes display megabase-sized regions, spanning both genes and intergenes, where the strand nucleotide composition asymmetry decreases linearly, possibly due to replication activity. These so-called skew-N domains cover about a third of the human genome and are bordered by two skew upward jumps that were hypothesized to compose a subset of “master” replication origins active in the germline. Skew-N domains were shown to exhibit a particular gene organization. Genes with CpG-rich promoters likely expressed in the germline are over represented near the master replication origins, with large genes being co-oriented with replication fork progression, which suggests some coordination of replication and transcription. In this study, we describe another skew structure that covers ∼13% of the human genome and that is bordered by putative master replication origins similar to the ones flanking skew-N domains. These skew-split-N domains have a shape reminiscent of a N, but split in half, leaving in the center a region of null skew whose length increases with domain size. These central regions (median size ∼860 kb) have a homogeneous composition, i.e. both a null and constant skew and a constant and low GC content. They correspond to heterochromatin gene deserts found in low-GC isochores with an average gene density of 0.81 promoters/Mb as compared to 7.73 promoters/Mb genome wide. The analysis of epigenetic marks and replication timing data confirms that, in these late replicating heterochomatic regions, the initiation of replication is likely to be random. This contrasts with the transcriptionally active euchromatin state found around the bordering well positioned master replication origins. Altogether skew-N domains and skew-split-N domains cover about 50% of the human genome.",

To date, the mechanism of lincRNAs polyadenylation related to cancer is rarely fully understood yet. In this paper, first we reported a comprehensive map of global lincRNAs polyadenylation sites (PASs) in five human cancer genomes; second we proposed a grouping method based on the pattern of genes expression and the manner of alternative polyadenylation (APA); third we investigated the distribution of motifs surrounding PASs. Our analysis reveals that about 70% of PASs are located in the sense strand of lincRNAs. Also more than 90% PASs in the antisense strand of lincRNAs are located in the intron regions. In addition, around 40% of lincRNA genes with PASs has APA sites. Four obvious motifs i.e., AATAAA, TTTTTTTT, CCAGSCTGG, and RGYRYRGTGG were detected in the sequences surrounding PASs in the normal and cancer tissues. Furthermore, a novel algorithm was proposed to recognize the lincRNAs PASs of tumor tissues based on support vector machine (SVM).

Improvements in high-throughput technologies have resulted in a large number of available protein–protein interactions. By taking advantage of these interaction data, researchers have proposed many computational methods to identify essential proteins at the network level. Most of these approaches focus on the topology of a static protein interaction network. However, the protein interaction network changes with time and condition. This important inherent dynamics of the protein interaction network is overlooked by previous methods. In this paper, we introduce a new method named CDLC to predict essential proteins by integrating dynamic local average connectivity and in-degree of proteins in complexes. CDLC is applied to the protein interaction network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results show that CDLC outperforms five other methods (Degree Centrality (DC), Local Average Connectivity-based method (LAC), Sum of ECC (SoECC), PeC and Co-Expression Weighted by Clustering coefficient (CoEWC)). In particular, CDLC could improve the prediction precision by more than 45% compared with DC methods. CDLC is also compared with the latest algorithm CEPPK, and a higher precision is achieved by CDLC. CDLC is available as Supplementary materials.

     "abstract": "Identification of DNA-binding proteins is essential in studying cellular activities as the DNA-binding proteins play a pivotal role in gene regulation. In this study, we propose newDNA-Prot, a DNA-binding protein predictor that employs support vector machine classifier and a comprehensive feature representation. The sequence representation are categorized into 6 groups: primary sequence based, evolutionary profile based, predicted secondary structure based, predicted relative solvent accessibility based, physicochemical property based and biological function based features. The mRMR, wrapper and two-stage feature selection methods are employed for removing irrelevant features and reducing redundant features. Experiments demonstrate that the two-stage method performs better than the mRMR and wrapper methods. We also perform a statistical analysis on the selected features and results show that more than 95% of the selected features are statistically significant and they cover all 6 feature groups. The newDNA-Prot method is compared with several state of the art algorithms, including iDNA-Prot, DNAbinder and DNA-Prot. The results demonstrate that newDNA-Prot method outperforms the iDNA-Prot, DNAbinder and DNA-Prot methods. More specific, newDNA-Prot improves the runner-up method, DNA-Prot for around 10% on several evaluation measures.

With limited structural information available for nitrated heme proteins from experiments, we herein performed a molecular dynamics study of human Mb with successive nitration of Tyr103, Tyr146, Trp7 and Trp14. We made a detailed comparison of protein motions, intramolecular contacts and internal cavities of nitrated Mbs with that of native Mb. It showed that although nitration of both Tyr103 and Tyr146 slightly alters the local conformation of heme active site, further nitration of both Trp7 and Trp14 shifts helix A apart from the rest of protein, which results in altered internal cavities and forms a water channel, representing an initial stage of Mb unfolding. The computational study provides an insight into the nitration of heme proteins at an atomic level, which is valuable for understanding the structure and function relationship of heme proteins in non-native states by nitration.",

A recent outbreak of anthrax in a tropical region uncovered natural and in vitro resistance against penicillin, ciprofloxacin, quinolone due to over exposure of the pathogen to these antibiotics. This fact combined with the ongoing threat of using B. anthracis as a biological weapon proves that the identification of new therapeutic targets is urgently needed.In this computational approach various databases and online based servers were used to detect essential proteins of B. anthracis A0248. Protein sequences of B. anthracis A0248 strain were retrieved from the NCBI database which was then run in CD-hit suite for clustering. NCBI BlastP against the human proteome and similarity search against DEG were done to find out essential human non-homologous proteins. Proteins involved in unique pathways were analyzed using KEGG genome database and PSORTb, CELLO v.2.5, ngLOC – these three tools were used to deduce putative cell surface proteins.Successive analysis revealed 116 proteins to be essential human non-homologs among which 17 were involved in unique metabolic pathways and 28 were predicted as membrane associated proteins. Both types of proteins can be exploited as they are unlikely to have homologous counterparts in the human host.Being human non-homologous, these proteins can be targeted for potential therapeutic drug development in future. Targets on unique metabolic and membrane-bound proteins can block cell wall synthesis, bacterial replication and signal transduction respectively.",

     "abstract": "The Mediator, a conserved multisubunit protein complex in eukaryotic organisms, regulates gene expression by bridging sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors to the general RNA polymerase II machinery. In yeast, Mediator complex is organized in three core modules (head, middle and tail) and a separable ‘CDK8 submodule’ consisting of four subunits including Cyclin-dependent kinase CDK8 (CDK8), Cyclin C (CycC), MED12, and MED13. The 3-D structure of human CDK8–CycC complex has been recently experimentally determined. To take advantage of this structure and the improved theoretical calculation methods, we have performed molecular dynamic simulations to study dynamics of CDK8 and two CDK8 point mutations (D173A and D189N), which have been identified in human cancers, with and without full length of the A-loop, as well as the binding between CDK8 and CycC. We found that CDK8 structure gradually loses two helical structures during the 50-ns molecular dynamic simulation, likely due to the presence of the full-length A-loop. In addition, our studies showed the hydrogen bond occupation of the CDK8 A-loop increases during the first 20-ns MD simulation and stays stable during the later 30-ns MD simulation. Four residues in the A-loop of CDK8 have high hydrogen bond occupation, while the rest residues have low or no hydrogen bond occupation. The hydrogen bond dynamic study of the A-loop residues exhibits three types of changes: increasing, decreasing, and stable. Furthermore, the 3-D structures of CDK8 point mutations D173A, D189N, T196A and T196D have been built by molecular modeling and further investigated by 50-ns molecular dynamic simulations. D173A has the highest average potential energy, while T196D has the lowest average potential energy, indicating that T196D is the most stable structure. Finally, we calculated theoretical binding energy of CDK8 and CycC by MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA methods, and the negative values obtained from both methods demonstrate stability of CDK8–CycC complex. Taken together, these analyses will improve our understanding of the exact functions of CDK8 and the interaction with its partner CycC.",

Endogenous adaptor protein known as MyD88 adapter-like protein (MAL) bind exclusively to the cytosolic portions of TLR2 and TLR4 to initiate downstream signalling. Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK) and protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) have been implicated to phosphorylate MAL and activate it to initiate downstream signalling. BTK has been associated with phosphorylation at positions Tyr86 and Tyr106, necessary for the activation of MAL but definite residual target of PKCδ in MAL is still to be explored. To produce a better understanding of the functional domains involved in the formation of MAL–kinase complexes, computer-aided studies were used to characterize the protein–protein interactions (PPIs) of phosphorylated BTK and PKCδ with MAL. Docking and physicochemical studies indicated that BTK was involved in close contact with Tyr86 and Tyr106 of MAL whereas PKCδ may phosphorylate Tyr106 only. Moreover, the electrostatics charge distribution of binding interfaces of BTK and PKCδ were distinct but compatible with respective regions of MAL. Our results implicate that position of Tyr86 is specifically phosphorylated by BTK whereas Tyr106 can be phosphorylated by competitive action of both BTK and PKCδ. Additionally, the residues of MAL which are necessary for interaction with TLR2, TLR4, MyD88 and SOCS-1 also play their roles in maintaining interaction with kinases and can be targeted in future to reduce TLR2 and TLR4 induced pathological responses.",

Functional structural domains and variations in DNA binding domains (DBD) and ligand binding domains (LBD) between Jining Gray goat and Boer goat were analyzed. The results indicate that the ERβ gene in Jining Gray goat includes a 1584 bp sequence with a complete open-reading-frame (ORF), encoding a 527 amino acid (aa) receptor protein. Compared to other species, the nucleotide homology is 73.9–98.9% and the amino acid homology is 79.5–98.5%. The main antigenic structural domains lie from the 97th aa to the 286th aa and from the 403rd aa to the 527th aa. The hydrophilicity and the surface probability of the structural domains are distributed throughout a range of amino acids. There are two different amino acids in the DBD and three different amino acids in the LBD between Jining Gray and Boer goats, resulting in dramatically different spatial structures for ERβ protein. These differences may explain the different biological activities of ERβ between the two goat species. This study firstly acquired the whole ERβ gene sequence of Jining Gray goat with a complete open reading frame, and analyzed its gene evolutionary relationship and predicted its mainly functional structural domains, which may very help for further understanding the genome evolution and gene diversity of goat ERβ.",

The functional impacts of 37 nsSNPs on aspirin inhibition potency of COX-1 with COX-1/aspirin molecular docking were computationally analyzed, and each SNP was scored based on DOCK Amber score. The data predicted that 22 nsSNPs could reduce COX-1 inhibition, while 15 nsSNPs showed increasing inhibition level in comparison to the regular COX-1 protein. In order to perform a comparing state, the Amber scores for two Arg119 mutants (R119A and R119Q) were also calculated. Moreover, among nsSNP variants, rs117122585 represented the closest Amber score to R119A mutant. A separate docking computation validated the score and represented a new binding position for ASA that acetyl group was located within the distance of 3.86 Å from Ser529 OH group.

We develop a method to resolve these difficulties. We verify a region's significance from two perspectives: distribution width and distribution depth. The former indicates how many insertions in a region while the latter evaluates the insertion distribution across the tumors in a region. We compare our method with kernel density estimation and sliding window on the simulated data, showing that our method not only identifies cancer-related insertions effectively, but also filters noises correctly.

In this paper, we propose a framework based on association rule mining to discover the potential regulatory relations between histone modifications and gene expression in Plasmodium falciparum. Our approach can output rules with statistical significance. Some of the discovered rules are supported by literature of experimental results.

     "abstract": "Protein methylation is a kind of post-translational modification (PTM), and typically takes place on lysine and arginine amino acid residues. Protein methylation is involved in many important biological processes, and most recent studies focused on lysine methylation of histones due to its critical roles in regulating transcriptional repression and activation. Histones possess highly conserved sequences and are homologous in most species. However, there is much less sequence conservation among non-histone proteins. Therefore, mechanisms for identifying lysine-methylated sites may greatly differ between histones and non-histone proteins. Nevertheless, this point of view was not considered in previous studies. Here we constructed two support vector machine (SVM) models by using lysine-methylated data from histones and non-histone proteins for predictions of lysine-methylated sites. Numerous features, such as the amino acid composition (AAC) and accessible surface area (ASA), were used in the SVM models, and the predictive performance was evaluated using five-fold cross-validations. For histones, the predictive sensitivity was 85.62% and specificity was 80.32%. For non-histone proteins, the predictive sensitivity was 69.1% and specificity was 88.72%. Results showed that our model significantly improved the predictive accuracy of histones compared to previous approaches. In addition, features of the flanking region of lysine-methylated sites on histones and non-histone proteins were also characterized and are discussed. A gene ontology functional analysis of lysine-methylated proteins and correlations of lysine-methylated sites with other PTMs in histones were also analyzed in detail. Finally, a web server, MethyK, was constructed to identify lysine-methylated sites. MethK now is available at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/MethK/.",

Even the better ones take days to detect higher order interactions in WTCCC data.We propose a fast algorithm for detection of high order epistatic interactions in GWAS. It runs k-means clustering algorithm on the set of all SNPs. Then candidates are selected from each cluster. These candidates are examined to find the causative SNPs of k-locus interactions. We use mutual information from information theory as the measure of association between genotypes and phenotypes.We tested the power and speed of our method on extensive sets of simulated data. The results show that our method has more or equal power, and runs much faster than previously reported methods. We also applied our algorithm on each of seven diseases in WTCCC data to analyze up to 5-locus interactions. It takes only a few hours to analyze 5-locus interactions in one dataset.

     "abstract": "Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) is a ubiquitous and opportunistic pathogen capable of causing acute, invasive pulmonary disease in susceptible hosts. Despite current therapeutic options, mortality associated with invasive Af infections remains unacceptably high, increasing 357% since 1980. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of novel therapeutic strategies, including more efficacious drugs acting on new targets. Thus, as noted in a recent review, “the identification of essential genes in fungi represents a crucial step in the development of new antifungal drugs”. Expanding the target space by rapidly identifying new essential genes has thus been described as “the most important task of genomics-based target validation”.In previous research, we were the first to show that essential gene annotation can be reliably transferred between distantly related four Prokaryotic species. In this study, we extend our machine learning approach to the much more complex Eukaryotic fungal species. A compendium of essential genes is predicted in Af by transferring known essential gene annotations from another filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. This approach predicts essential genes by integrating diverse types of intrinsic and context-dependent genomic features encoded in microbial genomes. The predicted essential datasets contained 1674 genes. We validated our results by comparing our predictions with known essential genes in Af, comparing our predictions with those predicted by homology mapping, and conducting conditional expressed alleles. We applied several layers of filters and selected a set of potential drug targets from the predicted essential genes. Finally, we have conducted wet lab knockout experiments to verify our predictions, which further validates the accuracy and wide applicability of the machine learning approach.The approach presented here significantly extended our ability to predict essential genes beyond orthologs and made it possible to predict an inventory of essential genes in Eukaryotic fungal species, amongst which a preferred subset of suitable drug targets may be selected. By selecting the best new targets, we believe that resultant drugs would exhibit an unparalleled clinical impact against a naive pathogen population. Additional benefits that a compendium of essential genes can provide are important information on cell function and evolutionary biology. Furthermore, mapping essential genes to pathways may also reveal critical check points in the pathogen's metabolism. Finally, this approach is highly reproducible and portable, and can be easily applied to predict essential genes in many more pathogenic microbes, especially those unculturable.",

However, only a few specific lncRNAs are well understood, whereas others are completely uncharacterized. To address this, there is a need for user-friendly platform to studying the putative regulatory functions of human lncRNAs.lncRNAMap is an integrated and comprehensive database relating to exploration of the putative regulatory functions of human lncRNAs with two mechanisms of regulation, by encoding siRNAs and by acting as miRNA decoys. To investigate lncRNAs producing siRNAs that regulate protein-coding genes, lncRNAMap integrated small RNAs (sRNAs) that were supported by publicly available deep sequencing data from various sRNA libraries and constructed lncRNA-derived siRNA–target interactions. In addition, lncRNAMap demonstrated that lncRNAs can act as targets for miRNAs that would otherwise regulate protein-coding genes. Previously studies indicated that intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs) either positive or negative regulated neighboring genes, therefore, lncRNAMap surveyed neighboring genes within a 1 Mb distance from the genomic location of specific lncRNAs and provided the expression profiles of lncRNA and its neighboring genes. The gene expression profiles may supply the relationship between lncRNA and its neighboring genes.lncRNAMap is a powerful user-friendly platform for the investigation of putative regulatory functions of human lncRNAs with producing siRNAs and acting as miRNA decoy. lncRNAMap is freely available on the web at http://lncRNAMap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/.",

The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) provides a valuable resource for pharmacoepidemiology, the study of the uses and the effects of drugs in large human population. However, FAERS is a spontaneous reporting system that inevitably contains noise that deviates the application of conventional clustering approaches. By performing a biclustering analysis on the FAERS data we identified 163 biclusters of drug-induced adverse reactions, counting for 691 ADRs and 240 drugs in total, where the number of ADR occurrences are consistently high across the associated drugs. Medically similar ADRs are derived from several distinct indications for use in the majority (145/163 = 88%) of the biclusters, which enabled us to interpret the underlying mechanisms that lead to similar ADRs. Furthermore, we compared the biclusters that contain same drugs but different ADRs, finding the cases where the populations of the patients were different in terms of age, sex, and body weight. We applied a biclustering approach to catalogue the relationship between drugs and adverse reactions from a large FAERS data set, and demonstrated a systematic way to uncover the cases different drug administrations resulted in similar adverse reactions, and the same drug can cause different reactions dependent on the patients’ conditions.",

     "abstract": "Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are recently discovered, endogenous small non-coding RNAs. piRNAs protect the genome from invasive transposable elements (TE) and sustain integrity of the genome in germ cell lineages. Small RNA-sequencing data can be used to detect piRNA activations in a cell under a specific condition. However, identification of cell specific piRNA activations requires sophisticated computational methods. As of now, there is only one computational method, proTRAC, to locate activated piRNAs from the sequencing data. proTRAC detects piRNA clusters based on a probabilistic analysis with assumption of a uniform distribution. Unfortunately, we were not able to locate activated piRNAs from our proprietary sequencing data in chicken germ cells using proTRAC. With a careful investigation on data sets, we found that a uniform or any statistical distribution for detecting piRNA clusters may not be assumed. Furthermore, small RNA-seq data contains many different types of RNAs which was not carefully taken into account in previous studies. To improve piRNA cluster identification, we developed piClust that uses a density based clustering approach without assumption of any parametric distribution. In previous studies, it is known that piRNAs exhibit a strong tendency of forming piRNA clusters in syntenic regions of the genome. Thus, the density based clustering approach is effective and robust to the existence of non-piRNAs or noise in the data. In experiments with piRNA data from human, mouse, rat and chicken, piClust was able to detect piRNA clusters from total small RNA-seq data from germ cell lines, while proTRAC was not successful. piClust outperformed proTRAC in terms of sensitivity and running time (up to 200 folds). piClust is currently available as a web service at http://epigenomics.snu.ac.kr/piclustweb.",

     "abstract": "Accessible biotechnology is enabling the cataloging of genetic variants in individuals in populations at unprecedented scales. The use of phylogeny of the individuals within populations allows a model-based approach to studying these variations, which is important in understanding relationships between and across populations. For the somatic genome, however, the phylogeny must take recombinations (and other genetic mixing events) into account. Hence the resulting topology is more complex than a tree. Unlike a tree topology, it is not as apparent which events are visible from the extant samples. An earlier work presented a mathematical model (called the minimal descriptor) for teasing apart the inherent visible information from that which any specific algorithm might see. We use this framework to study the effect of sampling sizes on the overall inferred genetic history. In this paper, we seek to understand the extent, characteristics (in terms of recent versus ancient genetic events) and reliability of what was resolvable within field samples drawn from modern populations.We observed that most of the visible ancient events are recoverable from relatively small sample sizes. However, without identification of this relatively small minority of ancient genetic events, most of the signal will appear to reflect modern events and admixtures. We also found that the more ancient events are likely to be reproduced with higher fidelity between multiple samplings, and that the identified older events are less likely to yield false positive discrimination between populations.We conclude that a recombinant phylogenetic reconstruction is necessary to identify which markers are most likely to discriminate ancient events, and to discriminate between populations with lower risk of false positives. Secondly, on a broader note, this study also provides a general methodology for a critical assessment of the inferred common genetic history of populations (say, in plant cultivars or animal populations).",

The collective coordinate biases the system to maximize the formation of hydrogen bonds at the protein–protein interface as well as all over the structure.

Such proteins are hypothetically regulated with cysteine-dependent transcription attenuation, namely the Rho-dependent or classic transcription attenuation. Cysteine is an important structural amino acid in various proteins and is required for synthesis of many sulfur-containing compounds, such as methionine, thiamine, glutathione, taurine and the lipoic acid. Earlier a few species of mycobacteria were predicted by the authors to have cysteine-dependent regulation of operons containing the cysK gene. In Escherichia coli this regulation is absent, and the same operon is regulated by the CysB transcription activator. The paper also studies Rho-dependent and classic transcription regulations in all annotated genes of mycobacteria available in GenBank and their orthologs in Actinomycetales. We predict regulations for many genes involved in sulfur metabolism and transport of sulfur-containing compounds; these regulations differ considerably among species. On the basis of predictions, we assign a putative role to proteins encoded by the regulated genes with unknown function, and also describe the structure of corresponding regulons, predict the lack of such regulations for many genes. Thus, all proteins with the uncharacterized Pfam domains PF14340 and PF00480, as well as some others, are predicted to be involved in sulfur metabolism. We also surmise the affinity of some transporters to sulfur-containing compounds. The obtained results considerably extend earlier large-scale studies of Rho-dependent and classic transcription attenuations.",

To clarify the nature of d-fructose's higher binding affinity over d-mannose, we studied interaction between the monosaccharides and the antibody using ab initio fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method considering solvation effect as implicit model (FMO-PCM) as well as explicit water model. The calculated binding free energies of the glycans were qualitatively well consistent with the experimentally reported order of their affinities with the antibody 2G12. In addition, the FMO-PCM calculation elucidated the advantages of d-fructose over d-mannose in the solvation energy as well as the entropic contribution term obtained by MD simulations. The effects of explicit water molecules observed in the X-ray crystal structure were also scrutinized by means of FMO methods. Significant pair interaction energies among d-fructose, amino acids, and water molecules were uncovered, which indicated contributions from the water molecules to the strong binding ability of d-fructose to the antibody 2G12. These FMO calculation results of explicit water model as well as implicit water model indicated that the strong binding of d-fructose over d-mannose was due to the solvation effects on the d-fructose interaction energy.",

Immunosuppressive domain (ISD) is a conserved region of transmembrane protein (TM) in envelope gene (env) of retroviruses. In vitro and vivo, evidence has shown that retroviral TM is highly immunosuppressive and a synthetic peptide (CKS-17) that shows homology to ISD inhibits immune function. ISD is probably a potential pathogenic element in HERVs. However, only less than one hundred ISDs of HERVs have been annotated by researchers so far, and universal software for domain prediction could not achieve sufficient accuracy for specific ISD. In this paper, a computational model is proposed to identify ISD in HERVs based on genome sequences only. It has a classification accuracy of 97.9% using Jack-knife test. 117 HERVs families were scanned with the model, 1002 new putative ISDs have been predicted and annotated in the human chromosomes. This model is also applicable to search for ISDs in human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV) and murine leukemia virus (MLV) because of the evolutionary relationship between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses.

Several machine learning methods have been proposed to identify conformational B-cell epitopes. However, the quality of these methods is not ideal. One question is whether or not the prediction of conformational B-cell epitopes can be improved by using ensemble methods. In this paper, we propose an ensemble method, which combined 12 support vector machine-based predictors, to predict the conformational B-cell epitopes, using an unbound dataset. AdaBoost and resampling methods are used to deal with an imbalanced labeled dataset. The proposed method achieves AUC of 0.642–0.672 on training dataset with 5-fold cross validation and AUC of 0.579–0.604 on test dataset. We also find some interesting results with the bound and unbound datasets. Epitopes are more accessible than non-epitopes, in bound and unbound datasets. Epitopes are also preferred in beta-turn, in bound and unbound datasets. The flexibility and polarity of epitopes are higher than non-epitopes. In a bound dataset, Asn (N), Glu (E), Gly (G), Lys (K), Ser (S), and Thr (T) are preferred in epitope regions, while Ala (A), Leu (L) and Val (V) are preferred in non-epitope regions.

Microarray-based gene expression profiling, which is successfully applied to the discovery of tumor biomarkers and the prediction of drug response, was suggested to predict the cancer outcomes using the gene signatures differentially expressed between two clinical states. However, many false positive genes unrelated to the phenotypic differences will be involved in the lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) when only using the statistical methods for gene selection, e.g. Student's t test, and subsequently affect the performance of the predictive models. For the purpose of improving the prediction of clinical outcomes, we optimized the selection of DEGs by using a combined strategy, for which the DEGs were firstly identified by the statistical methods, and then filtered by a similarity profiling approach that used for candidate gene prioritization. In our study, we firstly verified the molecular functions of the DEGs identified by the combined strategy with the gene expression data generated in the microarray experiments of Si-Wu-Tang, which is a popular formula in traditional Chinese medicine. The results showed that, for Si-Wu-Tang experimental data set, the cancer-related signaling pathways were significantly enriched by gene set enrichment analysis when using the DEG lists generated by the combined strategy, confirming the potentially cancer-preventive effect of Si-Wu-Tang. To verify the performance of the predictive models in clinical application, we used the combined strategy to select the DEGs as features from the gene expression data of the clinical samples, which were collected from the breast cancer patients, and constructed models to predict the chemotherapeutic sensitivity of tumors in breast cancer. After refining the DEG lists by a similarity profiling approach, the Matthew's correlation coefficients of predicting estrogen receptor status and the pathologic response to preoperative chemotherapy with the DEGs selected by the fold change ranking were 0.770 and 0.428, respectively, and were 0.748 and 0.373 with the DEGs selected by SAM, respectively, which were generally higher than those achieved with unrefined DEG lists and those achieved by the candidate models in the second phase of Microarray Quality Control project (0.732 and 0.301, respectively).

Therefore, identification and development of small molecule inhibitors targeting AKT and its signaling pathway can be therapeutic in treatment of cancer. Numerous studies report inhibitors that target the ATP-binding pocket in the kinase domains, but the similarity of this site, within the kinase family makes selectivity a major problem. The sequence identity amongst PH domains is significantly lower than that in kinase domains and developing more selective inhibitors is possible if PH domain is targeted. This in silico screening study is the first time report toward the identification of potential allosteric inhibitors expected to bind the cavity between kinase and PH domains of Akt1. Structural information of Akt1 was used to develop structure-based pharmacophore models comprising hydrophobic, acceptor, donor and ring features. The 3D structural information of previously identified allosteric Akt inhibitors obtained from literature was employed to develop a ligand-based pharmacophore model. Database was generated with drug like subset of ZINC and screening was performed based on 3D similarity to the selected pharmacophore hypotheses. Binding modes and affinities of the ligands were predicted by Glide software. Top scoring hits were further analyzed considering 2D similarity between the compounds, interactions with Akt1, fitness to pharmacophore models, ADME, druglikeness criteria and Induced-Fit docking. Using virtual screening methodologies, derivatives of 3-methyl-xanthine, quinoline-4-carboxamide and 2-[4-(cyclohexa-1,3-dien-1-yl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl]phenol were proposed as potential leads for allosteric inhibition of Akt1.",

In this paper, we optimized this method by running time evaluation using essential drugs defined by WHO and FDA-approved small-molecule drugs. The amount of running time allocated to the MCS-based virtual screening was varied, and statistical analysis was conducted to study the impact of computation running time on the screening results. It was determined that the running time efficiency can be improved without compromising accuracy by setting proper running time thresholds. In addition, the similarity of compound structures and its relevance to biological activity are analyzed quantitatively, which highlight the applicability of the MCS-based methods in predicting functions of small molecules. 15–30 s was established as a reasonable range for selecting a candidate running time threshold. The effect of CPU speed is considered and the conclusion is generalized. The potential biological activity of small molecules with unknown functions can be predicted by the MCS-based methods.",

Also, tumor lysate was added to DCs followed by addition of maturation factors. Simulations show that the proposed model can interpret the important features of empirical data. Owing to the nonlinearity properties, the proposed ANN model has been able not only to describe the contradictory empirical results, but also to predict new vaccination patterns for controlling the tumor growth.

The mechanism of GPCR oligomerization, and its effect on receptor function, is not well understood. In the present study, coarse grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) approach was adopted for studying the self-assembly process of the human GPCR, β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), for which several experimental evidences of the dimerization process and its effect on cellular functions are available. Since the crystal structure of β2-AR lacks the third intracellular loop, initially it was modelled and simulated using restrained MD in order to get a stable starting conformation. This structure was then converted to CG representation and 16 copies of it, inserted into a hydrated lipid bilayer, were simulated for 10 μs using the MARTINI force field. At the end of 10 μs, oligomers of β2-AR were found to be formed through the self-assembly mechanism which were further validated through various analyses of the receptors. The lipid bilayer analysis also helped to quantify this assembly mechanism. In order to identify the domains which are responsible for this oligomerization, a reverse transformation of the CG system back to all-atom structure and simulated annealing run were carried out at the end of 10 μs CGMD run. Analysis of the all-atom dimers thus obtained, revealed that TM1/TM1, H8/H8, TM1/TM5 and TM6/TM6 regions formed most of the dimerization surfaces, which is in accordance with some of the experimental observations and recent simulation results.",

The binding properties of the entire surface of the protein were scanned and several possible binding sites were identified in domains A and C of the protein, while domain B revealed no docking sites for peptides or for substrates or the allosteric regulator. It was found that the docking sites of different ligands were partially overlapping, pointing to the possibility that some regulatory effects, observed in the case of L-type pyruvate kinase, may be caused by the competition of different ligands for the same binding sites.",

Due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance strains, there is an essential need to develop novel drug targets to address the challenge of multidrug-resistant bacteria. In current study, the idea was to utilize the available genome or proteome in a subtractive genome analyses protocol to identify drug targets within two of the MRSA types, i.e., MRSA ST398 and MRSA 252. Recently, the use of subtractive genomic approaches helped in the identification and characterization of novel drug targets of a number of pathogens. Our protocol involved a similarity search between pathogen and host, essentiality study using the database of essential genes, metabolic functional association study using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database (KEGG), cellular membrane localization analysis and Drug Bank database. Functional family characterizations of the identified non homologous hypothetical essential proteins were done by SVMProt server. Druggability potential of each of the identified drug targets was also evaluated by Drug Bank database. Moreover, metabolic pathway analysis of the identified druggable essential proteins with KEGG revealed that the identified proteins are participating in unique and essential metabolic pathways amongst MRSA strains.In short, the complete proteome analyses by the use of advanced computational tools, databases and servers resulted in identification and characterization of few nonhomologous/hypothetical and essential proteins which are not homologous to the host genome. Therefore, these non-homologous essential targets ensure the survival of the pathogen and hence can be targeted for drug discovery.",

     "abstract": "Sequence subgrouping for a given sequence set can enable various informative tasks such as the functional discrimination of sequence subsets and the functional inference of unknown sequences. Because an identity threshold for sequence subgrouping may vary according to the given sequence set, it is highly desirable to construct a robust subgrouping algorithm which automatically identifies an optimal identity threshold and generates subgroups for a given sequence set. To meet this end, an automatic sequence subgrouping method, named ‘Subgrouping Automata’ was constructed. Firstly, tree analysis module analyzes the structure of tree and calculates the all possible subgroups in each node. Sequence similarity analysis module calculates average sequence similarity for all subgroups in each node. Representative sequence generation module finds a representative sequence using profile analysis and self-scoring for each subgroup. For all nodes, average sequence similarities are calculated and ‘Subgrouping Automata’ searches a node showing statistically maximum sequence similarity increase using Student's t-value. A node showing the maximum t-value, which gives the most significant differences in average sequence similarity between two adjacent nodes, is determined as an optimum subgrouping node in the phylogenetic tree. Further analysis showed that the optimum subgrouping node from SA prevents under-subgrouping and over-subgrouping.",

     "abstract": "Recognition of protein fold types is an important step in protein structure and function predictions and is also an important method in protein sequence-structure research. Protein fold type reflects the topological pattern of the structure's core. Now there are three methods of protein structure prediction, comparative modeling, fold recognition and de novo prediction. Since comparative modeling is limited by sequence similarity and there is too much workload in de novo prediction, fold recognition has the greatest potential. In order to improve recognition accuracy, a recognition method based on functional domain composition is proposed in this paper. This article focuses on the 124 fold types which have more than 2 samples in LIFCA database. We apply the functional domain composition to predict the fold types of a protein or a domain. In order to evaluate our method and its sensibility to the samples involving SCOP family divided, we tested our results from different aspects. The average sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) of the 124 fold types were found to be 94.58%, 99.96% and 0.91, respectively. Our results indicate that the functional domain composition method is a very promising method for protein fold recognition.

     "abstract": "Labor intensive experiments are typically required to identify the causal disease variants from a list of disease associated variants in the genome. For designing such experiments, candidate variants are ranked by their strength of genetic association with the disease. However, the two commonly used measures of genetic association, the odds-ratio (OR) and p-value may rank variants in different order. To integrate these two measures into a single analysis, here we transfer the volcano plot methodology from gene expression analysis to genetic association studies. In its original setting, volcano plots are scatter plots of fold-change and t-test statistic (or −log of the p-value), with the latter being more sensitive to sample size. In genetic association studies, the OR and Pearson's chi-square statistic (or equivalently its square root, chi; or the standardized log(OR)) can be analogously used in a volcano plot, allowing for their visual inspection. Moreover, the geometric interpretation of these plots leads to an intuitive method for filtering results by a combination of both OR and chi-square statistic, which we term “regularized-chi”. This method selects associated markers by a smooth curve in the volcano plot instead of the right-angled lines which corresponds to independent cutoffs for OR and chi-square statistic. The regularized-chi incorporates relatively more signals from variants with lower minor-allele-frequencies than chi-square test statistic. As rare variants tend to have stronger functional effects, regularized-chi is better suited to the task of prioritization of candidate genes.",

The molecule is comprised of a highly conserved lipid A and a variable outer core consisting of various sugars. LPS plays important roles in membrane stability in the bacterial cell and is also a potent activator of the human immune system. Despite its obvious importance, little is understood regarding the regulation of the individual enzymes involved or the pathway as a whole. LpxA and LpxC catalyze the first two steps in the LPS pathway. The reaction catalyzed by LpxA possesses a highly unfavourable equilibrium constant with no evidence of coupling to an energetically favourable reaction. In our model the presence of the second enzyme LpxC was sufficient to abate this unfavourable reaction and confirming previous studies suggesting that this reaction is the first committed step in LPS synthesis. It is believed that the protease FtsH regulates LpxC activity via cleavage. It is also suspected that the activity of FtsH is regulated by a metabolite produced by the LPS pathway; however, it is not known which one. In order to investigate these mechanisms, we obtained kinetic parameters from literature and developed estimates for other simulation parameters. Our simulations suggest that under modest increases in LpxC activity, FtsH is able to regulate the rate of product formation. However, under extreme increases in LpxC activities such as over-expression or asymmetrical cell division then FtsH activation may not be sufficient to regulate this first stage of synthesis.",

     "abstract": "Reptin functions in a wide range of biological processes including chromatin remodelling, nucleolar organization and transcriptional regulation of WNT signalling. As β-catenin dependent transcriptional repression and activation events involve binding of Reptin and histone deacetylase 1 to APPL endocytic proteins, this complex has become an important target to identify molecules governing endocytic processes and WNT signalling. Here, we describe the structural basis of APPL binding to Reptin to explore their mode of binding in context with APPL1/APPL2 dimerization. There is an evidence that both PH and BAR domains of APPL proteins exhibit alternately conserved regions involved in hetero-dimerization process and our in-silico data also corroborate this fact. Moreover, APPL2PH domain binds to the BAR domain region encompassing a nuclear localization signal. We conclude that APPLPH binding to BAR domain and Reptin is mutually exclusive which regulates the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Reptin. Furthermore, Reptin is unable to bind with membrane-associated APPL proteins. These observations were further expanded by experimental approaches where we identified a novel point mutation D316N lying in the APPL1PH domain which resulted in a significantly reduced binding with Reptin. By luciferase assays, we observed that overexpression of APPL1D316N and APPL1WT stimulated β-catenin/TCF dependent transcriptional activity in a similar manner which suggested that binding of Reptin to APPL1 is not necessary for β-catenin dependent target gene expression. Overall, our data attempt to highlight a comparative role of APPL proteins in controlling β-catenin dependent transcription mechanism which may improve our understanding of gene regulation.",

We designate these changes as signals because they can propagate within the molecule in the form of “perturbation wave”, transmit energy or information between different parts of protein, and serve as allosteric signals. We found that change points can distinguish between thermal fluctuations of atoms (noise) and signals in a protein despite the differences in the motility of amino acid residues. Clustering of the spatially close residues that were experiencing change points close in time, allowed us to map pathways of signal propagation in a protein at the atomic level of resolution. We propose a potential mechanism for the origin of the signal and its propagation that relies on the autonomic coherence resonance in atomic fluctuations. According to this mechanism, random synchronization of fluctuations of neighboring atoms results in a resonance, which increases amplitude of vibration of these atoms. This increase can be transmitted to the atoms colliding with the resonant atoms, leading to the propagating signal. The wavelet-based coherence analysis of the inter-atomic distances between carbon-alpha atoms and surrounding atoms for the residue pairs that belong to the same communication pathway allowed us to find time periods with temporarily locked phases, confirming the occurrence of conditions for resonance. Analysis of the mapped pathways demonstrated that they form a network that connects different regions of the protein.",

H. boliviensis and H. elongata DSM 2581T acquired distinct glutamate dehydrogenase genes through horizontal gene transfer from a different bacterium. Two alleles of glutamine synthetase could be found in H. boliviensis, one of which was obtained from a thermophilic archaeon via horizontal gene transfer. Two subunits of glutamate synthase were also present in H. boliviensis. The small β-subunit had a molecular weight of 52 kDa and was phylogenetically closely affiliated to proteins of other halomonads and Gammaproteobacteria.

Furthermore, putative enzymes obtained from the genome of H. boliviensis should permit complete glutamate metabolism. A similar metabolism should be followed by other halomonads. However, some phenotypic differences between halomonads, such as the ability to assimilate ammonia, resulted as a consequence of horizontal gene transfer.

The analysis of the geometry of the cation–π interactions has revealed that the average distance (d) value falls into distinct ranges corresponding to the multiple (4.28 Å) and single (5.50 Å) cation–π interactions. The G–Arg pair has the strongest interaction energy of −3.68 kcal mol−1 among all the possible pairs of amino acids and bases. Further, we found that the cation–π interactions due to five-membered rings of A and G are stronger than that with the atoms in six-membered rings. 8.7% stabilizing residues are involved in building cation–π interactions with the nucleic bases. There are three types of structural motifs significantly over-represented in protein–RNA interfaces: beta-turn-ir, niche-4r and st-staple. Tetraloops and kink-turns are the most abundant RNA motifs in protein–RNA interfaces. Amino acids deployed in the protein–RNA interfaces are deposited in helices, sheets and coils. Arg and Lys, involved in cation–π interactions, prefer to be in the solvent exposed surface. The results from this study might be used for structure–based prediction and as scaffolds for future protein–RNA complex design.",

     "abstract": "Technological advances in cytotoxicity analysis have now made it possible to obtain real time data on changes in cell growth, morphology and cell death. This type of testing has a great potential for reducing and refining traditional in vivo toxicology tests. By monitoring the dynamic response profile of living cells via the xCELLigence real-time cell analyzer for high-throughput (RTCA HT) system, cellular changes including cell number (cell index, CI) are recorded and analyzed. A special scaled index defined as normalized cell index (NCI) is used in the analysis which reduces the influence of inter-experimental variations. To assess the extent of exposure of the tested chemicals, a two-exponent model is presented to describe rate of cell growth and death. This model is embodied in the time and concentration-dependent cellular response curves, and the parameters k1 and k2 in this model are used to describe the rate of cell growth and death. Based on calculated k2 values and the corresponding concentrations, a concentration–response curve is fitted. As a result, a cytotoxicity assessment named KC50 is calculated. The validation of the proposed method is demonstrated by exposing six cell lines to 14 chemical compounds. Our findings suggest that the proposed KC50-based toxicity assay can be an alternative to the traditional single time-point assay such as LC50 (the concentration at which 50% of the cells are killed). The proposed index has a potential for routine evaluation of cytotoxicities. Another advantage of the proposed index is that it extracts cytotoxicity information when CI fails to detect the low toxicity.",

     "abstract": "The importance of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) is becoming increasingly appreciated, as these interactions lie at the core of virtually every biological process. Small molecule modulators that target PPIs are under exploration as new therapies. One of the greatest obstacles faced in crystallographically determining the 3D structures of proteins is coaxing the proteins to form “artificial” PPIs that lead to uniform crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction. This work compares interactions formed naturally, i.e., “biological”, with those artificially formed under crystallization conditions or “non-biological”. In particular, a detailed analysis of water molecules at the interfaces of high-resolution (≤2.30 Å) X-ray crystal structures of protein–protein complexes, where 140 are biological protein–protein complex structures and 112 include non-biological protein–protein interfaces, was carried out using modeling tools based on the HINT forcefield. Surprisingly few and relatively subtle differences were observed between the two types of interfaces: (i) non-biological interfaces are more polar than biological interfaces, yet there is better organized hydrogen bonding at the latter; (ii) biological associations rely more on water-mediated interactions with backbone atoms compared to non-biological associations; (iii) aromatic/planar residues play a larger role in biological associations with respect to water, and (iv) Lys has a particularly large role at non-biological interfaces. A support vector machines (SVMs) classifier using descriptors from this study was devised that was able to correctly classify 84% of the two interface types.",

     "abstract": "The protein structure prediction problem is a classical NP hard problem in bioinformatics. The lack of an effective global optimization method is the key obstacle in solving this problem. As one of the global optimization algorithms, tabu search (TS) algorithm has been successfully applied in many optimization problems. We define the new neighborhood conformation, tabu object and acceptance criteria of current conformation based on the original TS algorithm and put forward an improved TS algorithm. By integrating the heuristic initialization mechanism, the heuristic conformation updating mechanism, and the gradient method into the improved TS algorithm, a heuristic-based tabu search (HTS) algorithm is presented for predicting the two-dimensional (2D) protein folding structure in AB off-lattice model which consists of hydrophobic (A) and hydrophilic (B) monomers. The tabu search minimization leads to the basins of local minima, near which a local search mechanism is then proposed to further search for lower-energy conformations. To test the performance of the proposed algorithm, experiments are performed on four Fibonacci sequences and two real protein sequences. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has found the lowest-energy conformations so far for three shorter Fibonacci sequences and renewed the results for the longest one, as well as two real protein sequences, demonstrating that the HTS algorithm is quite promising in finding the ground states for AB off-lattice model proteins.",

A number of allergens have been identified and characterized in Fabaceae family, such as soybean and peanut, on the basis of biochemical and molecular biological approaches. However, our understanding of the allergens from chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), belonging to this family, is very limited.In this study, we aimed to identify putative and cross-reactive allergens from Chickpea (C. arietinum) by means of in silico analysis of the chickpea protein sequences and allergens sequences from Fabaceae family.We retrieved known allergen sequences in Fabaceae family from the IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Database. We performed a protein BLAST (BLASTp) on these sequences to retrieve the similar sequences from chickpea. We further analyzed the retrieved chickpea sequences using a combination of in silico tools, to assess them for their allergenicity potential. Following this, we built structure models using FUGUE: Sequence-structure homology; these models generated by the recognition tool were viewed in Swiss-PDB viewer.Through this in silico approach, we identified seven novel putative allergens from chickpea proteome sequences on the basis of similarity of sequence, structure and physicochemical properties with the known reported legume allergens. Four out of seven putative allergens may also show cross reactivity with reported allergens since potential allergens had common sequence and structural features with the reported allergens.The in silico proteomic identification of the allergen proteins in chickpea provides a basis for future research on developing hypoallergenic foods containing chickpea. Such bioinformatics approaches, combined with experimental methodology, will help delineate an efficient and comprehensive approach to assess allergenicity and pave the way for a better understanding of the biological and medical basis of the same.",

In vitro studies of Mtb growth have identified changes in isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (MS) that enable bacterial persistence under low oxygen and other environmentally limiting conditions. Systems chemical biology (SCB) enables us to evaluate the effects of small molecule inhibitors not only on the reaction catalyzed by malate synthase and isocitrate lyase, but the effect on the complete tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) by taking into account complex network relationships within that system.To study the kinetic consequences of inhibition on persistent bacilli, we implement a systems-chemical biology (SCB) platform and perform a chemistry-centric analysis of key metabolic pathways believed to impact Mtb latency. We explore consequences of disrupting the function of malate synthase (MS) and isocitrate lyase (ICL) during aerobic and hypoxic non-replicating persistence (NRP) growth by using the SCB method to identify small molecules that inhibit the function of MS and ICL, and simulating the metabolic consequence of the disruption.Results indicate variations in target and non-target reaction steps, clear differences in the normal and low oxygen models, as well as dosage dependent response. Simulation results from singular and combined enzyme inhibition strategies suggest ICL may be the more effective target for chemotherapeutic treatment against Mtb growing in a microenvironment where oxygen is slowly depleted, which may favor persistence.",

However, the observed sequences include many errors of base call. Therefore, if next-generation sequencing is applied to analysis of a heterogeneous population of various mutant sequences, it is necessary to discriminate between true bases as point mutations and errors of base call in the observed sequences, and to subject the sequences to error-correction processes. To address this issue, we have developed a novel method of error correction based on the Potts model and a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate of its parameters corresponding to the “true sequences”. Our method of error correction utilizes (1) the “quality scores” which are assigned to individual bases in the observed sequences and (2) the neighborhood relationship among the observed sequences mapped in sequence space. The computer experiments of error correction of artificially generated sequences supported the effectiveness of our method, showing that 50–90% of errors were removed.

Morphological and immunohistochemical features of HL as well as the spatial distribution of malignant cells differ from other lymphoma and cancer types. Sophisticated protocols for immunostaining and the acquisition of high-resolution images become routine in pathological labs. Large and daily growing databases of high-resolution digital images are currently emerging. A systematic tissue image analysis and computer-aided exploration may provide new insights into HL pathology. The automated analysis of high resolution images, however, is a hard task in terms of required computing time and memory. Special concepts and pipelines for analyzing high-resolution images can boost the exploration of image databases.In this paper, we report an analysis of digital color images recorded in high-resolution of HL tissue slides. Applying a protocol of CD30 immunostaining to identify malignant cells, we implement a pipeline to handle and explore image data of stained HL tissue images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic application of image analysis to HL tissue slides. To illustrate the concept and methods we analyze images of two different HL types, nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity as the most common forms and reactive lymphoid tissue for comparison. We implemented a pipeline which is adapted to the special requirements of whole slide images of HL tissue and identifies relevant regions that contain malignant cells.Using a preprocessing approach, we separate the relevant tissue region from the background. We assign pixels in the images to one of the six predefined classes: Hematoxylin+, CD30+, Nonspecific red, Unstained, Background, and Low intensity, applying a supervised recognition method. Local areas with pixels assigned to the class CD30+ identify regions of interest. As expected, an increased amount of CD30+ pixels is a characteristic feature of nodular sclerosis, and the non-lymphoma cases show a characteristically low amount of CD30+ stain. Images of mixed cellularity samples include cases of high CD30+ coloring as well as cases of low CD30+ coloring.",

The methods have been evolving over time by improving both experimental designs and computational techniques, and since the primary aim of these developments is the procurement of reliable and high-quality data, better techniques resulted on average in an evolution toward higher quality structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Each method leaves a specific quantitative and qualitative “trace” in the PDB entry. Certain information relevant to one method (e.g. dynamics for NMR) may be lacking for another method. Furthermore, some standard measures of quality for one method cannot be calculated for other experimental methods, e.g. crystal resolution or NMR bundle RMSD. Consequently, structures are classified in the PDB by the method used. Here we introduce a method to estimate a measure of equivalent X-ray resolution (e-resolution), expressed in units of Å, to assess the quality of any type of monomeric, single-chain protein structure, irrespective of the experimental structure determination method. We showed and compared the trends in the quality of structures in the Protein Data Bank over the last two decades for five different experimental techniques, excluding theoretical structure predictions. We observed that as new methods are introduced, they undergo a rapid method development evolution: within several years the e-resolution score becomes similar for structures obtained from the five methods and they improve from initially poor performance to acceptable quality, comparable with previously established methods, the performance of which is essentially stable.",

Then, we introduce a support vector machine method to discriminate the halophilic and non-halophilic proteins, by using a novel Pearson VII universal function based kernel. In the three validation check methods, it achieved an overall accuracy of 97.7%, 91.7% and 86.9% and outperformed other machine learning algorithms. We also address the influence of protein size on prediction accuracy and found the worse performance for small size proteins might be some significant residues (Cys and Lys) were missing in the proteins.",

     "abstract": "The modulation of the properties and function of cell membranes by small volatile substances is important for many biomedical applications. Despite available experimental results, molecular mechanisms of action of inhalants and organic solvents, such as acetone, on lipid membranes remain not well understood. To gain a better understanding of how acetone interacts with membranes, we have performed a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a POPC bilayer in aqueous solution in the presence of acetone, whose concentration was varied from 2.8 to 11.2 mol%. The MD simulations of passive distribution of acetone between a bulk water phase and a lipid bilayer show that acetone favors partitioning into the water-free region of the bilayer, located near the carbonyl groups of the phospholipids and at the beginning of the hydrocarbon core of the lipid membrane. Using MD umbrella sampling, we found that the permeability barrier of ∼0.5 kcal/mol exists for acetone partitioning into the membrane. In addition, a Gibbs free energy profile of the acetone penetration across a bilayer demonstrates a favorable potential energy well of −3.6 kcal/mol, located at 15–16 Å from the bilayer center. The analysis of the structural and dynamics properties of the model membrane revealed that the POPC bilayer can tolerate the presence of acetone in the concentration range of 2.8–5.6 mol%. The accumulation of the higher acetone concentration of 11.2 mol% results, however, in drastic disordering of phospholipid packing and the increase in the membrane fluidity. The acetone molecules push the lipid heads apart and, hence, act as spacers in the headgroup region. This effect leads to the increase in the average headgroup area per molecule. In addition, the acyl tail region of the membrane also becomes less dense. We suggest, therefore, that the molecular mechanism of acetone action on the phospholipid bilayer has many common features with the effects of short chain alcohols, DMSO, and chloroform.",

However, the traditional association analysis methods do not have enough power for detecting the effects of rare variants with limited sample size. As a solution to this problem, pooling rare variants by their functions into a composite variant provides an alternative way for identifying susceptible genes. In this paper, we propose a new pooling method to test the variant–disease association and to identify the functional rare variants related with the disease. Variants with smaller and larger risk measures defined as the ratio of allele frequencies between cases and controls are pooled and a chi-square test of the resultant pooled table is calculated. We vary the threshold of pooling over all possible values and use the maximal chi-square as test statistic. The maximal chi-square is in fact the global maximum over all possible poolings. Our approach is similar to the existing variable-threshold method, but we threshold on the risk measure instead of allele frequencies of controls. Simulation results show that our method performs better in both association testing and variant selection.",

Design of experiments employing central composite design technique was used to obtain the training samples. In the second step, ant colony optimization technique for continuous domain was employed to maximize the PGA activity by finding the optimal inputs for the developed ANN model. Further, the effect of a combination of ant colony optimization for continuous domain with a preferential local search strategy was studied to analyze the performance. For a comparative study, the training samples were fed into the response surface methodology optimization software to maximize the PGA production.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenous RNAs that play important regulatory roles in plant development and stress response by negatively affecting gene expression at post-transcriptional level. Three genes of pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS), pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR) and proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) are regulating proline metabolism. Until now, little is known about miRNAs regulating proline accumulation. In this work, in order to understand whether miRNAs related to mRNAs of enzymes to regulate proline enrichment under drought stress, we used mRNAs of related enzymes as the targets of miRNAs to search miRBase using BLAST and find many query miRNA sequences. After a range of filtering criteria, 11 known miRNAs classified into 6 miRNA families were predicted. The result from qRT-PCR assay showed that 10 out of 11 predicted miRNAs were successfully detected including 9 down-regulated miRNAs and one up-regulated miRNA. Based on expression and functional analysis, we identified miR172, miR396a, miR396c and miR4233 may regulate P5CS gene, and miR2673 and miR6461 may regulate P5CR and ProDH gene, respectively. The findings can help us make a good understanding of the roles of miRNAs in regulation of proline accumulation and provide molecular evidence for involvement process of drought tolerance in potato.",

For this, we assembled databases of interacting protein pairs for yeast and obtained an extremely large PPI dataset which comprises of 135 154 non-redundant interactions between 6191 yeast proteins. A scoring scheme considering eight heterogeneous biological features resulted with a broad score distribution and a highly reliable network consisting of 29 046 physical interactions with scores higher than the threshold value of 0.85, for which sensitivity, specificity and coverage were 86%, 68%, and 72%, respectively.

     "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation are reciprocally regulated. As hyperphosphorylation is implicated in tau pathology, approaches have been exploited to reduce the magnitude of tau phosphorylation by increasing the level of tau O-GlcNAcylation. With mathematic models constructed to describe different kinetic scenarios, we analyzed the temporal change of an O-GlcNAcylated protein in contrast to that of the phosphorylated form upon inhibition of O-GlcNAcase (OGA). The analyses indicate that when degradation of the modified protein is negligible relative to the naked one, the magnitude of O-GlcNAcylated protein increase is proportional to the level of inhibition, while the extent of phosphorylated protein decline varies due to other factors. Furthermore, the increase of O-GlcNAcylated protein parallels with the decrease of phosphorylated form upon acute or short-term inhibition of OGA, as observed in many in vitro and short term in vivo studies. However, phosphorylated protein is predicted to return to its initial level while O-GlcNAcylated protein to achieve a higher steady level under sustained inhibition. This simulated result is in line with a recent report on long-term inhibition of OGA in transgenic mice. Noticeably, inhibition withdrawal is anticipated to cause a transient rise of phosphorylated protein. If degradation of modified proteins proceeds in addition to the naked one, the characteristic temporal profiles of each form in response to OGA inhibition would depend on the relative importance of individual degradation pathways. The models described herein may serve as a useful investigational tool that will provide insight into pharmacological intervention for tauopathies in particular and for reciprocally modulated reactions in general.",

A statistical analysis of X motifs in all available tRNAs of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in the genomic tRNA database (September 2012, http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/GtRNAdb/, Lowe and Eddy, 1997) is carried out here. For this purpose, a search algorithm of X motifs in a DNA sequence is developed. Two definitions allow to determine the occurrence probabilities of X motifs and the circular codes X, X 1 = P ( X ) and X 2 = P 2 ( X ) ( P being a circular permutation map applied on X) in a population of tRNAs. This approach identifies X motifs in the 5′ and/or 3′ regions of 16 isoaccepting tRNAs (except for the tRNAs Arg, His, Ser and Trp). The statistical analyses are performed on different and large tRNA populations according to the taxonomy (prokaryotes and eukaryotes), tRNA length and tRNA score. Finally, a circular code property observed in genes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes is identified in the 3′ regions of 19 isoaccepting tRNAs of prokaryotes and eukaryotes (except for the tRNA Leu). The identification of X motifs and a gene circular code property in tRNAs strengthens the concept proposed in Michel (2012) of a possible translation (framing) code based on a circular code.",

     "abstract": "Finding candidate genes associated with a disease is an important issue in biomedical research. Recently, many network-based methods have been proposed that implicitly utilize the modularity principle, which states that genes causing the same or similar diseases tend to form physical or functional modules in gene/protein relationship networks. Of these methods, the random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm is considered to be a state-of-the-art approach, but the modularity principle has not been fully considered in traditional RWR approaches. Therefore, we propose a novel method called ORIENT (neighbor-favoring weight reinforcement) to improve the performance of RWR through proper intensification of the weights of interactions close to the known disease genes.Through extensive simulations over hundreds of diseases, we observed that our approach performs better than the traditional RWR algorithm. In particular, our method worked best when the weights of interactions involving only the nearest neighbor genes of the disease genes were intensified. Interestingly, the performance of our approach was negatively related to the probability with which the random walk will restart, whereas the performance of RWR without the weight-reinforcement was positively related in dense gene/protein relationship networks. We further found that the density of the disease gene-projected sub-graph and the number of paths between the disease genes in a gene/protein relationship network may be explanatory variables for the RWR performance. Finally, a comparison with other well-known gene prioritization tools including Endeavour, ToppGene, and BioGraph, revealed that our approach shows significantly better performance.Taken together, these findings provide insight to efficiently guide RWR in disease gene prioritization.",

The main advantage of the present platform is that all the miRNA target genes’ information and disease records are drawn from experimentally verified or high confidence records.MiRNA target gene results are annotated with reference to the disease gene as well as the pathway database. The correlation strength between miRNA and target gene expression profile is quantified by computing the correlation coefficient using the NCI-60 expression profiling data. Comprehensive analysis of the NCI-60 data found that the cumulative percentage of negative correlation coefficients for cleavage regulation is slightly higher than its positive counterpart; which indicated that the mRNA degradation mechanism is slightly dominant. In addition, the RNAHybrid and TargetScans scores are computed which potentially served as quantitative estimators for miRNA–mRNA binding events.Three scores are defined for each miRNA–mRNA pair, which are based on the disease gene and pathway information. These three scores allow user to sort out high confidence cancer-related miRNA–mRNA pairs.Statistical tests were applied to investigate the relations of three chromosomal features, i.e., CpG island, fragile site, and miRNA cluster, with cancer-related miRNAs. A web-based interface has been set up for query, which can be accessed at: http://ppi.bioinfo.asia.edu.tw/mirna_target/The main advantage of the present platform on miRNA–mRNA targeting information is that all the target genes’ information and disease records are experimentally verified.

Although this theory is well-established for protein–protein interfaces, its applicability to other protein interfaces remains unclear. Our goal was to verify its applicability to protein–DNA interfaces. We performed Molecular Dynamics simulations in explicit solvent of several protein–DNA complexes and measured a variety of solvent accessible surface area (SASA) features, as well as, radial distribution functions of hot-spots and null-spots. Our aim was to test the influence of water in their coordination sphere. Our results show that hot-spots tend to have fewer water molecules in their neighborhood when compared to null-spots, and higher values of ΔSASA, which confirms their occlusion from solvent.

Unfortunately, beta-lactamases are evolving at a rapid pace with new inhibitor resistant mutants emerging every day, driving the design and development of novel beta-lactamase inhibitors. Here, we examined the inhibitor recognition mechanism of two common beta-lactamases using molecular dynamics simulations. Binding of beta-lactamase inhibitor protein (BLIP) caused changes in the flexibility of regions away from the binding site. One of these regions was the H10 helix, which was previously identified to form a lid over an allosteric inhibitor binding site. Closer examination of the H10 helix using sequence and structure comparisons with other beta-lactamases revealed the presence of a highly conserved Trp229 residue, which forms a stacking interaction with two conserved proline residues. Molecular dynamics simulations on the Trp229Ala mutants of TEM-1 and SHV-1 resulted in decreased stability in the apo form, possibly due to loss of the stacking interaction as a result of the mutation. The mutant TEM-1 beta-lactamase had higher H10 fluctuations in the presence of BLIP, higher affinity to BLIP and higher cross-correlations with BLIP. Our results suggest that the H10 helix and specifically W229 are important modulators of the allosteric communication between the active site and the allosteric site.",

In this paper, we propose a novel approach called “Neighbor Relativity Coefficient” (NRC) based on interaction network topology which estimates the functional similarity between two proteins. NRC is calculated for each pair of proteins based on their graph-based features including distance, common neighbors and the number of paths between them. In order to ascribe function to an un-annotated protein, NRC estimates a weight for each neighbor to transfer its annotation to the unknown protein. Finally, the unknown protein will be annotated by the top score transferred functions. We also investigate the effect of using different coefficients for various types of functions. The proposed method has been evaluated on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens interaction networks. The performance analysis demonstrates that NRC yields better results in comparison with previous protein function prediction approaches that utilize interaction network.",

     "abstract": "Biomarker discovery is a challenging task of bioinformatics especially when targeting high dimensional problems such as SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) datasets. Various types of feature selection methods can be applied to accomplish this task. Typically, using features versus class labels of samples in the training dataset, these methods aim at selecting feature subsets with maximal classification accuracies. Although finding such class-discriminative features is crucial, selection of relevant SNPs for maximizing other properties that exist in the nature of population genetics such as the correlation between genetic diversity and geographical distance of ethnic groups can also be equally important. In this work, a methodology using a multi objective optimization technique called Pareto Optimal is utilized for selecting SNP subsets offering both high classification accuracy and correlation between genomic and geographical distances. In this method, discriminatory power of an SNP is determined using mutual information and its contribution to the genomic–geographical correlation is estimated using its loadings on principal components. Combining these objectives, the proposed method identifies SNP subsets that can better discriminate ethnic groups than those obtained with sole mutual information and yield higher correlation than those obtained with sole principal components on the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) SNP dataset.",

Although a number of researches have been done, the general properties of combinatorial transcriptional regulatory elements, including their patterns and distributions, are still not well understood. Specially, the understanding for laws of transcriptional regulation involving introns is challenging. Here, we performed statistical analyses on potentially interacting motif pairs in human housekeeping genes and tissue-specific genes of some tissues. We first identified transcriptional regulatory motifs in promoter sequences, including the first introns, using a sequence-based approach which incorporates several different sequence backgrounds. And then we predicted the potentially interacting motif pairs using Hypergeometric distribution and Mann–Whitney U-test. The validation of the predicted interacting motif pairs has been carried out via analyses of orthologous conservation and enrichment. The distribution characteristics of the identified motif pairs were examined using a probability model. We found that interacting motif pairs have some significant preferences in location, distance and orientation in housekeeping and tissue-specific genes. The results suggest that the features of transcriptional regulation in housekeeping genes are different from the tissue-specific genes. Besides, location preferences of the motif pairs provide clues to the way of the introns participating in transcriptional regulation in different tissue-specific genes.",

Furthermore, it is found that MAGEA/CSAG genes also exist in orangutan and rhesus monkey palindromes by homologous searching.

Comparative sequence analysis of the arms and genes on the primate MAGEA/CSAG-palindromes provides possible evidence of subsequently arm to arm gene conversion.

In this paper, we propose a one-per-class model for high dimensional datasets. In the proposed method, we extract different feature subsets for each class in a dataset and apply the classification process on the multiple feature subsets. Finally, we merge the prediction results of the feature subsets and determine the final class label of an unknown instance data. The originality of the proposed model is to use appropriate feature subsets for each class. To show the usefulness of the proposed approach, we have developed an application method following the proposed model.

Since the curve showing such a relationship in Nc-plot is a useful reference line to display the main features of codon usage pattern for a number of genes, its high accuracy is important and necessary. Under ideal and ultimate conditions listed in this text a computational sample of Nc versus GC3s was derived and calculated. By nonlinear regression analysis, the relationship between Nc and GC3s without synonymous codon selection can be approximated by: N c = 2.5 − s + 29.5 / ( s 2 + ( 1 − s ) 2 ) , instead of Wright's: N c = 2 + s + 29 / ( s 2 + ( 1 − s ) 2 ) , where s denotes GC3s.

Although the method did not generate as large of perturbations to the template structures as necessary, the analysis of the results gives unique insights into the differences in packing between the target structures and their templates. Considerable variation in packing is found between target and template structures even when the structures are close, and this variation is found due to 2 and 3 body packing interactions. Outside the inherent restrictions in packing representation of the PDB, the first steps in correctly defining those regions of variable packing have been mapped primarily to local interactions, as the packing at the secondary and tertiary structure are largely conserved. Of the scoring functions used, a loop scoring function based on water structure exhibited some promise for discrimination.

From simulations of a stochastic model of gene expression at the nucleotide and codon levels we show that, within realistic parameter values, the nucleotide length affects RNA and protein mean levels, as well as the expected transient time for RNA and protein numbers to change, following a signal. Fluctuations in RNA and protein numbers are found to be minimized for a small range of lengths, which matches the means of the distributions of lengths found in E. coli of both essential and non-essential genes. The variance of the length distribution for essential genes is found to be smaller than for non-essential genes, implying that these distributions are far from random. Finally, gene lengths are shown to affect the kinetics of a genetic switch, namely, the correlation between temporal proteins numbers, the stability of the two noisy attractors of the switch, and how biased is the choice of noisy attractor. The stability increases with gene length due to increased ‘memory’ about the previous states of the switch. We argue that, by affecting the dynamics of gene expression and of genetic circuits, gene lengths are subject to selection.",

In Lepidochelys the +2 frameshifted mitochondrial Cytb gene lacks stops, open reading frames from other genes code for unknown proteins, and for regular mitochondrial proteins after frameshifts according to the overlapping genetic code. Lepidochelys’ inversion between proteins coded by regular and overlapping genetic codes substantiates the existence of overlap coding. ND4 differs among Lepidochelys mitochondrial genomes: it is regular in DQ486893; in NC_011516, the open reading frame codes for another protein, the regular ND4 protein is coded by the frameshifted sequence reassigning stops as in other turtles. These systematic patterns are incompatible with Genbank/sequencing errors and DNA decay. Random mixing of synonymous codons, conserving main frame coding properties, shows optimization of natural sequences for overlap coding; Ka/Ks analyses show high positive (directional) selection on overlapping genes. Tests based on circular genetic codes confirm programmed frameshifts in ND3 and ND4l genes, and predicted frameshift sites for overlap coding in Lepidochelys. Chelonian mitochondria adapt for overlapping gene expression: cloverleaf formation by antisense tRNAs with predicted anticodons matching stops coevolves with overlap coding; antisense tRNAs with predicted expanded anticodons (frameshift suppressor tRNAs) associate with frameshift-coding in ND3 and ND4l, a potential regulation of frameshifted overlap coding.

No meaningful topological index has yet been suggested for the analysis of such type of RNA graphs. Recalling that the second eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix can be used to track topological changes in the case of coarse grain tree-graphs, it is plausible to assume that a topological index such as the Wiener index that represents all Laplacian eigenvalues may provide a similar guide for full graphs. However, by its original definition, the Wiener index was defined for acyclic graphs. Nevertheless, similarly to cyclic chemical graphs, small RNA graphs can be analyzed using elementary cuts, which enables the calculation of topological indices for small RNAs in an intuitive way. We show how to calculate a structural descriptor that is suitable for cyclic graphs, the Szeged index, for small RNA graphs by elementary cuts.

     "abstract": "The evolvability of proteins is not only restricted by functional and structural importance, but also by other factors such as gene duplication, protein stability, and an organism's robustness. Recently, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)/regions (IDRs) have been suggested to play a role in facilitating protein evolution. However, the mechanisms by which this occurs remain largely unknown. To address this, we have systematically analyzed the relationship between the evolvability, stability, and function of IDPs/IDRs. Evolutionary analysis shows that more recently emerged IDRs have higher evolutionary rates with more functional constraints relaxed (or experiencing more positive selection), and that this may have caused accelerated evolution in the flanking regions and in the whole protein. A systematic analysis of observed stability changes due to single amino acid mutations in IDRs and ordered regions shows that while most mutations induce a destabilizing effect in proteins, mutations in IDRs cause smaller stability changes than in ordered regions. The weaker impact of mutations in IDRs on protein stability may have advantages for protein evolvability in the gain of new functions. Interestingly, however, an analysis of functional motifs in the PROSITE and ELM databases showed that motifs in IDRs are more conserved, characterized by smaller entropy and lower evolutionary rate, than in ordered regions. This apparently opposing evolutionary effect may be partly due to the flexible nature of motifs in IDRs, which require some key amino acid residues to engage in tighter interactions with other molecules. Our study suggests that the unique conformational and thermodynamic characteristics of IDPs/IDRs play an important role in the evolvability of proteins to gain new functions.",

     "abstract": "In protein databases there is a substantial number of proteins structurally determined but without function annotation. Understanding the relationship between function and structure can be useful to predict function on a large scale. We have analyzed the similarities in global physicochemical parameters for a set of enzymes which were classified according to the four Enzyme Commission (EC) hierarchical levels. Using relevance theory we introduced a distance between proteins in the space of physicochemical characteristics. This was done by minimizing a cost function of the metric tensor built to reflect the EC classification system. Using an unsupervised clustering method on a set of 1025 enzymes, we obtained no relevant clustering formation compatible with EC classification. The distance distributions between enzymes from the same EC group and from different EC groups were compared by histograms. Such analysis was also performed using sequence alignment similarity as a distance. Our results suggest that global structure parameters are not sufficient to segregate enzymes according to EC hierarchy. This indicates that features essential for function are rather local than global. Consequently, methods for predicting function based on global attributes should not obtain high accuracy in main EC classes prediction without relying on similarities between enzymes from training and validation datasets. Furthermore, these results are consistent with a substantial number of studies suggesting that function evolves fundamentally by recruitment, i.e., a same protein motif or fold can be used to perform different enzymatic functions and a few specific amino acids (AAs) are actually responsible for enzyme activity. These essential amino acids should belong to active sites and an effective method for predicting function should be able to recognize them.",

Then, we showed that each of the five DE gene lists captured a part of the differential expression signals from which we were able to extract metastasis-associated functions non-randomly reproducible across different datasets.

     "abstract": "The p22phox protein is an essential subunit of the cytochrome b558 of the NADPH oxidase (Nox) complex which by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays important role in regulating cellular function. p22phox stabilises the Nox enzyme, assists in catalytic core maturation and in the meantime provides an anchoring site for cytosolic regulatory subunits to bind. However, the protein structure of the p22phox is still uncertain. In this study we use an in silico computational bioinformatic approach to produce a consensus 3-dimensional model of the p22phox. Based on published protein sequence data of human p22phox and by using transmembrane specific protein prediction algorithms, we found that p22phox consists of two domains: an N-terminal transmembrane domain (124 a.a.) and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (71 a.a.). In its predicted most stable form, p22phox contains three transmembrane helices leading to an extracellular N-terminus and an extensive (39 a.a.) extracellular loop between helices 2 and 3. Furthermore, we locate the cytosolic domain phosphorylation site at threonine147 which literature shows is capable of priming the p22phox, in order to accept its binding partners. Our results are consistent with the biological characterisation of p22phox derived from experiments using specific antibody or genetic manipulation. Our 3-D protein model provides insights into the biological function of p22phox and cytochrome b558, and can be used as tool to investigate the regulatory mechanism of Nox isoforms.",

Although several MI methods exist, prior to our contribution no systematic method had been developed to assess their performance, or to establish numerical thresholds to detect co-evolving amino acid sites. The current study performed a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm on influenza viral sequences to capture their evolutionary characteristics. A consensus maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was estimated from the samples, together with their amino acid substitution statistics, from which we generated synthetic sequences of known dependent and independent paired amino acid sites. A pair-to-pair and influenza-specific amino acid substitution matrix (P2PFLU) incorporated into Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees (BEAST) enumerated these synthetic sequences. The sequences inherited evolutionary features and co-varying characteristics from the real viral sequences, rendering these synthetic data ideal for exploring their co-evolving features. For the MI measure, we proposed a novel metric called the empirical MI (MIEm), which outperformed other MI measures in analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC). We implemented our approach on 1086 all-time PB2 sequences of influenza A H5N1 viruses, in which we found 97 sites exhibiting co-evolutionary substitution of one or more amino acid sites. In particular, PB2 451, along with eight other PB2 sites of various MIEm scores, was found to co-evolve with PB2 627, a known species-associated amino acid residue which plays a critical role in influenza virus replication.",

     "abstract": "Amyloidosis is characterized by misfolding of proteins. The clinical gastrointestinal manifestations of amyloidosis may mimic other disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease or colonic cancer. As these patients have a high risk for bleeding and poor wound healing following surgery it is important to diagnose them correctly and do a careful preoperative assessment. The most common form of colonic amyloidosis is caused by Serum Amyloid A (SAA), an acute phase protein of unknown function. It is expressed in response to inflammation and the increased levels may lead to amyloidosis. The main treatment is to suppress the acute phase response and thereby reduce production of SAA.As no structure for SAA is available we aim to perform an in silico assessment of its structural and fibrillation properties. In the paper we propose an ab initio model of the structure of SAA, which consists of a five membered helical bundle with a fold related to the tetratricopeptide repeat domain. As there are uncertainties relating to the packing of the helices, each helical region is subjected to triplicate molecular dynamics simulations to assess the integrity of the structural region. The first helix, stretching from residues 1 to 13, is the least stable according to the simulations; almost all of the helical conformation is lost during the 10 ns simulations, whereas the other helices maintain portions that remain in an helical conformation in at least 80% of the simulations. All helices are also subjected to a single 100 ns simulation to investigate how the secondary structure develops over time. In them helix 1 adopts a β-hairpin structure similar to other fibril forming proteins. The β-hairpin can in turn multimerise and form a mature fibril structure. The mechanism behind the conformational transition appears to be driven by interactions of side chains of charged residues, particularly Arginine 1. It exchanges interaction partners in the simulation and stabilizes intermediate conformations on the folding pathway to the final β-hairpin.",

Nineteen independent structures were determined for the Na+/β-hairpin interacting systems, and their folding pathways are different. (i) For NaS47, the turn is rapidly shaped with the help of Na+ and acts as the folding nucleus for the rest regions. Two intermediate states are observed and the resulted structure is the most folded. (ii) For NaB41, NaB52, NaB54, NaS55 and NaB56, the inclusive Na+ ions are anchored by β-strands. The local structures around the Na+ ions and the turn regions fold simultaneously and serve as two independent folding nuclei. (iii) The other systems have no folding nuclei and correspond to low-folded structures. Long-range electrostatic interactions contribute a lot to the folding, especially from the four negatively charged residues (Glu42, Asp46, Asp47 and Glu56). The initial positions of the Na+ ions are largely responsible for the different folding behaviors. The interactions with sidechain- rather than backbone-O atoms generally lead to more compact structures. Another factor affecting the folding is whether the O atoms are associated with native H-bonds, and those involved show decreased affinities to metal ions. The addition of water solvent does not induce obvious folding and conformational transitions to the Na+/β-hairpin interacting systems.",

It is important to know how this hormone is synthesized and how its production is regulated to understand the roles of ethylene in plant development. The aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS) gene is a rate-limiting enzyme in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway, which is encoded by a highly divergent multi-gene family in plant species. Although many ACS genes have been cloned from a wide variety of plant species previously, their origin and evolutionary process are still not clear. In this study, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis based on an updated dataset including 107 members of plant ACS genes and eight ACS-like genes from animal as well as six AATase genes. The motifs were identified and the positive selection and functional divergence in the ACS gene family were detected. The results obtained from these analyses are consistent with previous division of the ACS gene family in angiosperm, i.e., three distinct clades, and show that the duplications of three subclades (I, II and III) ACS genes have occurred after the divergence of gymnosperm and angiosperm. We conclude that the ACS genes could have experienced three times significant positive selection as they underwent expansion in land plants and gain the full-scale ethylene biosynthesis and regulatory functions, and all plant ACS genes originated from plant-ACS-like genes which come from AATase genes.",

However, the extremely difficult optimization problem arising from energy function is a key challenge in protein folding simulation. The energy landscape paving (ELP) method has already been applied very successfully to off-lattice protein models and other optimization problems with complex energy landscape in continuous space. By improving the ELP method, and subsequently incorporating the neighborhood strategy with the pull-move set into the improved ELP method, a heuristic ELP algorithm is proposed to find low-energy conformations of 3D HP lattice model proteins in the discrete space. The algorithm is tested on three sets of 3D HP benchmark instances consisting 31 sequences. For eleven sequences with 27 monomers, the proposed method explores the conformation surfaces more efficiently than other methods, and finds new lower energies in several cases. For ten 48-monomer sequences, we find the lowest energies so far. With the achieved results, the algorithm converges rapidly and efficiently. For all ten 64-monomer sequences, the algorithm finds lower energies within comparable computation times than previous methods. Numeric results show that the heuristic ELP method is a competitive tool for protein folding simulation in 3D lattice model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of ELP to the 3D discrete space.",

First, amino acid residues on a protein structure are clustered into spatial groups using hierarchical agglomerative clustering, based on the distance between them. Second, the protein structure is represented using a graph, where each node denotes a cluster of amino acids. The nodes are labeled with an evolutionary profile derived from the multiple alignment of homologous sequences. Then, a shortest-path graph kernel is used to calculate similarities between the graphs. Finally, a support vector machine using this graph kernel is used to train classifiers for protein function prediction.

For that, we model the kinetics of expression of a gene responsible for promoting cell division at the expense of resources in the environment in individual cells of a population. We model mutations that affect the kinetics of the rate limiting steps and selective pressure in various environmental conditions. Depletion of resources leads to cell death. We find that small changes in the evolutionary constraints can favor widely different noise levels in RNA and protein numbers. Increasing the cost in nutrients for division favors noisier expression.

This circular code X is a set of 20 trinucleotides allowing the reading frames in genes to be retrieved locally, i.e. anywhere in genes and in particular without start codons. This reading frame retrieval needs a window length l of 12 nucleotides (l ≥ 12). With a window length strictly less than 12 nucleotides (l < 12), some words of X, called ambiguous words, are found in the shifted frames (the reading frame shifted by one or two nucleotides) preventing the reading frame in genes to be retrieved. Since 1996, these ambiguous words of X were never studied.In the first part of this paper, we identify all the ambiguous words of the common trinucleotide circular code X. With a length l varying from 1 to 11 nucleotides, the type and the occurrence number (multiplicity) of ambiguous words of X are given in each shifted frame. Maximal ambiguous words of X, words which are not factors of another ambiguous words, are also determined. Two probability definitions based on these results show that the common trinucleotide circular code X retrieves the reading frame in genes with a probability of about 90% with a window length of 6 nucleotides, and a probability of 99.9% with a window length of 9 nucleotides (100% with a window length of 12 nucleotides, by definition of a circular code).In the second part of this paper, we identify X circular code motifs (shortly X motifs) in transfer RNA and 16S ribosomal RNA: a tRNA X motif of 26 nucleotides including the anticodon stem-loop and seven 16S rRNA X motifs of length greater or equal to 15 nucleotides. Window lengths of reading frame retrieval with each trinucleotide of these X motifs are also determined. Thanks to the crystal structure 3I8G (Jenner et al., 2010), a 3D visualization of X motifs in the ribosome shows several spatial configurations involving mRNA X motifs, A-tRNA and E-tRNA X motifs, and four 16S rRNA X motifs. Another identified 16S rRNA X motif is involved in the decoding center which recognizes the codon–anticodon helix in A-tRNA. From a code theory point of view, these identified X circular code motifs and their mathematical properties may constitute a translation code involved in retrieval, maintenance and synchronization of reading frames in genes.",

     "abstract": "tRNA, tmRNA and some small RNA genes are recognized as general integration hotspots of genomic islands (GIs). The GMP synthase gene (guaA) has been firstly identified as one insertion hotspot of foreign DNA fragments. Thirty four islands integrated into the guaA genes were identified in the 987 completely sequenced archaeal and bacterial genomes. These alien islands were widely distributed within the host strains belonging to Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. The analysis of structural characteristics of these GIs is important for further determination of the island mobility and transference into suitable hosts. The putative functional integrases encoded by guaA-associated islands were mainly composed of phage P4 integrases, and followed by phage PhiLC3 integrases. Interestingly, island-encoding AlpA is close to P4 integrase and is deduced to be the positive transcriptional regulatory factor of P4 integrase while the XRE protein is close to PhiLC3 integrase and may be the negative transcriptional regulatory factor of PhiLC3 integrase. An 8-bp consensus sequence (5′-GAGTGGGA-3′) within the direct repeats of these GIs is the cutting site of the P4 integrases encoding by guaA-associated islands, in which the third nucleotide (G) is the key site. The large-scale investigation of the content of GMP synthase gene hotspots may be useful to find important functional islands within members of many key bacterial species and to transfer useful islands into more suitable hosts.",

Potential STATREs in the region from −1819 to −271 bp of the hIR gene promoter were identified by their homology with the consensus STATRE (5′ TTC nnn GAA 3′) using the SEQFIND programme developed in our laboratory. We located five virtual STATRE-like sites: [(I): −1472/−1464], [(II): −1548/−1540], [(III): −1552/−1544], [(IV): −1587/−1579] and [(V): −1678/−1670] showing a difference of only one base from this consensus. These STATREs-like sites were situated between 33 bp upstream the 5′ half-element of the estrogen response element 1 (ERE1)-like (−1430/−1418) and 102 bp upstream the 5′ half-element of the ERE2-like (−1567/−1555) complexed with AP-1-like sites. A principal complex constituted by STATREs (II–IV) the ERE2 and AP-1 sites (IV and V) was located between −1587/−1540 bp of the hIR gene promoter.In conclusion, these results represent the first identification of virtual STATREs in the hIR gene promoter. These STATREs appear to be specifically located in the surroundings of the two EREs overlapped by various AP-1 sites. These complexes could mediate crosstalk among STATs, estrogen receptor β (ERβ), and AP-1 regulating the ERβ-mediated transcriptional repression of the hIR gene and insulin resistance in U-937 cells.",

The mitochondrial protein import machinery consists of dozens of subunits, and they are of modular design. However, to date, it is not clear when certain component was added to the machinery. Using extensive homology searches, the evolutionary history of the mitochondrial protein import machinery was reconstructed. The results indicated that 6 of the 35 subunits have homologs in prokaryote, suggesting that they were prokaryotic origin; the major subunit gains were occurred in the earliest stage of eukaryotic evolution; subsequent to the gain of these conserved set of subunits, the mitochondrial protein import machinery components diversified along the eukaryotic lineages and a number of lineage-specific subunits can be observed. Furthermore, protein import systems of mitochondria-like organelles (hydrogenosomes and mitosomes) have dramatically reduced their subunit contents, however, they share most of the prokaryotic origin components with mitochondrion.",

This cellular domain includes a large diversity of organisms characterized as prokaryotes with basal transcriptional machinery similar to eukarya. In this work we explore the most recent findings concerning the transcriptional regulatory organization in archaeal genomes since the perspective of the DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs), such as the high proportion of archaeal TFs homologous to bacteria, the apparent deficit of TFs, only comparable to the proportion of TFs in parasites or intracellular pathogenic bacteria, suggesting a deficit in this class of proteins. We discuss an appealing hypothesis to explain the apparent deficit of TFs in archaea, based on their characteristics, such as their small length sizes. The hypothesis suggests that a large fraction of these small-sized TFs could supply the deficit of TFs in archaea, by forming different combinations of monomers similar to that observed in eukaryotic transcriptional machinery, where a wide diversity of protein–protein interactions could act as mediators of regulatory feedback, indicating a chimera of bacterial and eukaryotic TFs’ functionality. Finally, we discuss how global experiments can help to understand in a global context the role of TFs in these organisms.",

     "abstract": "Proteins are involved in almost every action of every organism by interacting with other small molecules including drugs. Computationally predicting the drug–protein interactions is particularly important in speeding up the process of developing novel drugs. To borrow the information from existing drug–protein interactions, we need to define the similarity among proteins and the similarity among drugs. Usually these similarities are defined based on one single data source and many methods have been proposed. However, the availability of many genomic and chemogenomic data sources allows us to integrate these useful data sources to improve the predictions. Thus a great challenge is how to integrate these heterogeneous data sources. Here, we propose a kernel-based method to predict drug–protein interactions by integrating multiple types of data. Specially, we collect drug pharmacological and therapeutic effects, drug chemical structures, and protein genomic information to characterize the drug–target interactions, then integrate them by a kernel function within a support vector machine (SVM)-based predictor. With this data fusion technology, we establish the drug–protein interactions from a collections of data sources. Our new method is validated on four classes of drug target proteins, including enzymes, ion channels (ICs), G-protein couple receptors (GPCRs), and nuclear receptors (NRs). We find that every single data source is predictive and integration of different data sources allows the improvement of accuracy, i.e., data integration can uncover more experimentally observed drug–target interactions upon the same levels of false positive rate than single data source based methods. The functional annotation analysis indicates that our new predictions are worthy of future experimental validation. In conclusion, our new method can efficiently integrate diverse data sources, and will promote the further research in drug discovery.",

We have compiled the presently largest sample (120 sites) of published nucleotide sequences with experimentally confirmed binding to GAGA protein. Analysis of the sample has demonstrated that despite an apparent structural diversity of the GAGA sites, they fall into four distinct groups, namely, (1) the sites containing two GAG trinucleotides with no more than one nucleotide substitution in each and separated by spacers with a length of 1 or 3 nucleotides (GAGnGAG and GAGnnnGAG); (2) the sites containing a single GAGAG motif; (3) (GA)3–9 microsatellite repeats; and (4) the sites corresponding to three and more direct repeats of GAG trinucleotide homolog and its inverted repeats separated by spacers of various lengths. Using the software package SITECON, the methods were elaborated for recognizing the sites of GAGnGAG (method 1) and GAGnnnGAG (method 2) types in DNA sequences. Experimental verification confirmed the ability to interact with the GAGA factor for 72% of the sites predicted using method 1 and 94.5% of the sites predicted by method 2. Application of the experimentally verified methods to analyzing the localization of potential GAGA binding sites in the target genes of this transcription factor has demonstrated that the 5′-untranslated regions (5′UTRs) and first introns are enriched for these sites (two–threefold relative to the average occurrence frequency in the D. melanogaster genome) as compared with a moderate enrichment (not exceeding 1.5-fold) of promoter regions (−4000/+200 bp or −1000/+100 bp).",

     "abstract": "A complex network of biochemical reactions present in an organism generates various biological moieties necessary for its survival. It is seen that biological systems are robust to genetic and environmental changes at all levels of organization. Functions of various organisms are sustained against mutational changes by using alternative pathways. It is also seen that if any one of the paths for production of the same metabolite is hampered, an alternate path tries to overcome this defect and helps in combating the damage.Certain physical, chemical or genetic change in any of the precursor substrate of a biochemical reaction may damage the production of the ultimate product. We employ a quantitative approach for simulating this phenomena of causing a physical change in the biochemical reactions by performing external perturbations to 12 metabolic pathways under carbohydrate metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisae as well as 14 metabolic pathways under carbohydrate metabolism in Homo sapiens. Here, we investigate the relationship between structure and degree of compatibility of metabolites against external perturbations, i.e., robustness. Robustness can also be further used to identify the extent to which a metabolic pathway can resist a mutation event. Biological networks with a certain connectivity distribution may be very resilient to a particular attack but not to another. The goal of this work is to determine the exact boundary of network breakdown due to both random and targeted attack, thereby analyzing its robustness. We also find that compared to various non-standard models, metabolic networks are exceptionally robust. Here, we report the use of a ‘Resilience-based’ score for enumerating the concept of ‘network-breakdown’. We also use this approach for analyzing metabolite essentiality providing insight into cellular robustness that can be further used for future drug development.We have investigated the behavior of metabolic pathways under carbohydrate metabolism in S. cerevisae and H. sapiens against random and targeted attack. Both random as well as targeted resilience were calculated by formulating a measure, that we termed as ‘Resilience score’. Datasets of metabolites were collected for 12 metabolic pathways belonging to carbohydrate metabolism in S. cerevisae and 14 metabolic pathways belonging to carbohydrate metabolism in H. sapiens from Kyoto Encyclopedia for Genes and Genomes (KEGG).",

Although AsA and tocochromanol biosynthesis pathways have been well characterized using Arabidopsis, these pathways are still poorly understood in rice, which is an economically important monocot cereal crop. In this study using computational analysis of sequenced rice genome, we identified eight and seven potential non-redundant members involved in AsA and tocochromanol biosynthetic pathways, respectively. The results reveal that the common feature of these gene promoters is the combination of light-responsive, hormone-responsive, and stress-responsive elements.

We have investigated the interaction between the microtubule nucleation and dynamics parameters, using macroscopic Monte Carlo simulations, to determine how these parameters contribute to the underlying microtubule array morphology (i.e. polymer density and length distribution). In addition to the well-characterized steady state achieved between free tubulin subunits and microtubule polymer, we propose that microtubule nucleation and extinction constitute a second, interdependent steady state process. Our simulation studies show that the magnitude of both nucleation and extinction additively impacts the final steady state free subunit concentration. We systematically varied individual microtubule dynamics parameters to survey the effects on array morphology and find specific sensitivity to perturbations of catastrophe frequency. Altering the cellular context for the microtubule array, we find that nucleation template number plays a defining role in shaping the microtubule length distribution and polymer density.",

The most intriguing factor of this interest is that malfunctioning of these signaling pathways (Hedgehog, Notch, Wnt etc.) leads to several human diseases, especially to cancer. This study deals with the β-catenin dependent branch of Wnt signaling and the Hedgehog signaling pathways which offer potential targeting points for cancer drug development. The identification of all proteins functioning in these signaling networks is crucial for the efforts of preventing tumor formation. Here, through integration of protein–protein interaction data and Gene Ontology annotations, Wnt/β-catenin and Hedgehog signaling networks consisting of proteins that have statistically high probability of being biologically related to these signaling pathways were reconstructed in Drosophila melanogaster. Next, by the structural network analyses, the crucial components functioning in these pathways were identified. The proteins Arm, Frizzled receptors (Fz and Fz2), Arr, Apc, Axn, Ci and Ptc were detected as the key proteins in these networks. Futhermore, the hub protein Mer having tumor suppressor function may be proposed as a putative drug target for cancer and deserves further investigation via experimental methods. Finally, the crosstalk analysis between the reconstructed networks reveals that these two signaling networks crosstalk to each other.",

In comparison to scoring function, the development of gap penalty functions has rarely been addressed in profile–profile alignment algorithms. Although indel frequency profiles have been used to construct profile-based variable gap penalties in some profile–profile alignment algorithms, there is still no fair comparison between variable gap penalties and traditional linear gap penalties to quantify the improvement of alignment accuracy. We compared two linear gap penalty functions, the traditional affine gap penalty (AGP) and the bilinear gap penalty (BGP), with two profile-based variable gap penalty functions, the Profile-based Gap Penalty used in SP5 (SPGP) and a new Weighted Profile-based Gap Penalty (WPGP) developed by us, on some well-established benchmark datasets. Our results show that profile-based variable gap penalties get limited improvements than linear gap penalties, whether incorporated with secondary structure information or not. Secondary structure information appears less powerful to be incorporated into gap penalties than into scoring functions. Analysis of gap length distributions indicates that gap penalties could stably maintain corresponding distributions of gap lengths in their alignments, but the distribution difference from reference alignments does not reflect the performance of gap penalties. There is useful information in indel frequency profiles, but it is still not good enough for improving alignment accuracy when used in profile-based variable gap penalties.

The proposed approach utilizes features obtained from both dipeptide composition (DC) and amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) based feature extraction strategies. Different feature spaces are obtained by varying the dimensionality using PseAAC for a selected base learner. The performance of the individual learning mechanisms such as support vector machine, nearest neighbor, probabilistic neural network, covariant discriminant, which are trained using PseAAC based features is first analyzed. Classifiers are developed using same learning mechanism but trained on PseAAC based feature spaces of varying dimensions. These classifiers are combined through voting strategy and an improvement in prediction performance is achieved. Prediction performance is further enhanced by developing CE-PLoc through the combination of different learning mechanisms trained on both DC based feature space and PseAAC based feature spaces of varying dimensions. The predictive performance of proposed CE-PLoc is evaluated for two benchmark datasets of protein subcellular locations using accuracy, MCC, and Q-statistics. Using the jackknife test, prediction accuracies of 81.47 and 83.99% are obtained for 12 and 14 subcellular locations datasets, respectively.

In the presence of errors in the experimental data, the assembly problem is computationally challenging, and its solution may not lead to a unique reconstruct. The enumeration of all alternative solutions is important in drawing a reliable conclusion on the target sequence, and is often overlooked in the heuristic approaches that are currently available. In this paper, we develop an integer programming formulation and global optimization solution strategy to solve the sequence assembly problem with errors in the data. We also propose an efficient technique to identify all alternative reconstructs. When applied to examples of sequencing-by-hybridization, our approach dramatically increases the length of DNA sequences that can be handled with global optimality certificate to over 10,000, which is more than 10 times longer than previously reported. For some problem instances, alternative solutions exhibited a wide range of different ability in reproducing the target DNA sequence. Therefore, it is important to utilize the methodology proposed in this paper in order to obtain all alternative solutions to reliably infer the true reconstruct. These alternative solutions can be used to refine the obtained results and guide the design of further experiments to correctly reconstruct the target DNA sequence.",

     "abstract": "Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis has been widely applied in the investigation of the mechanisms of diseases, especially cancer. Recent studies revealed that cancer proteins tend to interact more strongly than other categories of proteins, even essential proteins, in the human interactome. However, it remains unclear whether this observation was introduced by the bias towards more cancer studies in humans. Here, we examined this important issue by uniquely comparing network characteristics of cancer proteins with three other sets of proteins in four organisms, three of which (fly, worm, and yeast) whose interactomes are essentially not biased towards cancer or other diseases. We confirmed that cancer proteins had stronger connectivity, shorter distance, and larger betweenness centrality than non-cancer disease proteins, essential proteins, and control proteins. Our statistical evaluation indicated that such observations were overall unlikely attributed to random events. Considering the large size and high quality of the PPI data in the four organisms, the conclusion that cancer proteins interact strongly in the PPI networks is reliable and robust. This conclusion suggests that perturbation of cancer proteins might cause major changes of cellular systems and result in abnormal cell function leading to cancer.",

     "abstract": "When using microarray data for studying a complex disease such as cancer, it is a common practice to normalize data to force all arrays to have the same distribution of probe intensities regardless of the biological groups of samples. The assumption underlying such normalization is that in a disease the majority of genes are not differentially expressed genes (DE genes) and the numbers of up- and down-regulated genes are roughly equal. However, accumulated evidences suggest gene expressions could be widely altered in cancer, so we need to evaluate the sensitivities of biological discoveries to violation of the normalization assumption. Here, we analyzed 7 large Affymetrix datasets of pair-matched normal and cancer samples for cancers collected in the NCBI GEO database. We showed that in 6 of these 7 datasets, the medians of perfect match (PM) probe intensities increased in cancer state and the increases were significant in three datasets, suggesting the assumption that all arrays have the same median probe intensities regardless of the biological groups of samples might be misleading. Then, we evaluated the effects of three currently most widely used normalization algorithms (RMA, MAS5.0 and dChip) on the selection of DE genes by comparing them with LVS which relies less on the above-mentioned assumption. The results showed using RMA, MAS5.0 and dChip may produce lots of false results of down-regulated DE genes while missing many up-regulated DE genes. At least for cancer study, normalizing all arrays to have the same distribution of probe intensities regardless of the biological groups of samples might be misleading. Thus, most current normalizations based on unreliable assumptions may distort biological differences between normal and cancer samples. The LVS algorithm might perform relatively well due to that it relies less on the above-mentioned assumption. Also, our results indicate that genes may be widely up-regulated in most human cancer.",

     "abstract": "Identifying essential proteins is very important for understanding the minimal requirements of cellular survival and development. Fast growth in the amount of available protein–protein interactions has produced unprecedented opportunities for detecting protein essentiality from the network level. Essential proteins have been found to be more abundant among those highly connected proteins. However, there exist a number of highly connected proteins which are not essential. By analyzing these proteins, we find that few of their neighbors interact with each other. Thus, we propose a new local method, named LAC, to determine a protein's essentiality by evaluating the relationship between a protein and its neighbors. The performance of LAC is validated based on the yeast protein interaction networks obtained from two different databases: DIP and BioGRID. The experimental results of the two networks show that the number of essential proteins predicted by LAC clearly exceeds that explored by Degree Centrality (DC). More over, LAC is also compared with other seven measures of protein centrality (Neighborhood Component (DMNC), Betweenness Centrality (BC), Closeness Centrality (CC), Bottle Neck (BN), Information Centrality (IC), Eigenvector Centrality (EC), and Subgraph Centrality (SC)) in identifying essential proteins. The comparison results based on the validations of sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy consistently show that LAC outweighs these seven previous methods.",

In this article, we performed a meta-analysis of 10 prostate cancer microarray expression datasets to identify the common signatures at both the gene and pathway levels. As the enrichment analysis result of GeneGo's database and KEGG database, 97.8% and 66.7% of the signatures show higher similarity at pathway level than that at gene level, respectively.

An overlap of 15 enriched pathways was observed in at least eight datasets. Eight of these pathways were first described as being associated with prostate cancer.

Surprisingly, we also found a vectorial folding pathway that was shown recently for co-translational folding in the ribosome exit tunnel. Furthermore, we found that all three-helix subunits in the chain can fold into native-like conformations independently, especially those at the two terminal parts and the middle of the chain, which may be responsible for the nucleation's.

As a resolution to this we present a method based on the use of topological descriptions of global protein structure, providing an independent means to assess the ability of structural alignment to maintain meaningful structural correspondances on a large scale.Using a large set of decoys of specified global fold we benchmark three widely used methods for structure comparison, SAP, TM-align and DALI, and test the degree to which this assumption is justified for these methods. Application of a topological edit distance measure to provide a scale of the degree of fold change shows that while there is a broad correlation between high structural alignment scores and low edit distances there remain many pairs of highly significant score which differ by core strand swaps and therefore are structurally different on a global level.

The experimental performance analysis shows that optimistic synchronization algorithms, together with careful controls over the speculative execution, are necessary to achieve considerable speedup and scalability in parallel spatial stochastic simulation of chemical reactions.

Most composition-based classification methods use all features instead of a subset of features that may maximize classifier accuracy. We show that feature selection methods can boost performance of taxonomic classifiers. This work proposes three different filter-based feature selection methods that stem from information theory: (1) a technique that combines Kullback–Leibler, Mutual Information, and distance information, (2) a text mining technique, TF-IDF, and (3) minimum redundancy-maximum-relevance (mRMR). The feature selection methods are compared by how well they improve support vector machine classification of genomic reads. Overall, the 6mer mRMR method performs well, especially on the phyla-level. If the number of total features is very large, feature selection becomes difficult because a small subset of features that captures a majority of the data variance is less likely to exist. Therefore, we conclude that there is a trade-off between feature set size and feature selection method to optimize classification performance. For larger feature set sizes, TF-IDF works better for finer-resolutions while mRMR performs the best out of any method for N = 6 for all taxonomic levels.",

Using a large set of experimentally confirmed eukaryotic N-glycoproteins we analyzed the relative position and distribution of sequons. N-Glycosylation probability was found to be lower in the termini of protein sequences compared to the mid region. N-glycosylated sequons were found much farther from C terminus compared to the N-terminus of the protein sequence and this effect was more pronounced for NXS sequons. The distribution of sequons, modeled based on balls-in-boxes classical occupancy, showed a near-maximum probability. Considerable proportion of sequons was found within a distance of ten amino acids, indicating that the steric hindrance was not a key factor in protein N-glycosylation. Interestingly, the distribution of all sequons present in N-glycoproteins showed a pattern very similar to that of glycosylated sequons.

In this paper, all the Arabidopsis anther genes and every gene's potential co-expressed partners are collected by cross-database search. By combining simple pair gene co-expression networks, a complex Arabidopsis anther co-expression network is constructed. Maximum-clique algorithm is then applied to mine the groups reflecting co-expression relationships among multiple Arabidopsis anther genes that are represented by completely connected graphs. As a result, 254 Arabidopsis anther complete co-expression groups are obtained and our analysis shows that all the genes in the same group have high propensity to be functionally related and co-expressed together.

     "abstract": "Codon–anticodon mismatches and tRNA misloadings cause translational amino acid misinsertions, producing dysfunctional proteins. Here I explore the original hypothesis whether mismatches tend to compensate misacylation, so as to insert the amino acid coded by the codon. This error compensation is promoted by the fact that codon–anticodon mismatch stabilities increase with tRNA misacylation potentials (predicted by ‘tfam’) by non-cognate amino acids coded by the mismatched codons for most tRNAs examined. Error compensation is independent of preferential misacylation by non-cognate amino acids physico-chemically similar to cognate amino acids, a phenomenon that decreases misinsertion impacts. Error compensation correlates negatively with (a) codon/anticodon abundance (in human mitochondria and Escherichia coli); (b) developmental instability (estimated by fluctuating asymmetry in bilateral counts of subdigital lamellae, in each of two lizard genera, Anolis and Sceloporus); and (c) pathogenicity of human mitochondrial tRNA polymorphisms. Patterns described here suggest that tRNA misacylation is sometimes compensated by codon–anticodon mismatches. Hence translation inserts the amino acid coded by the mismatched codon, despite mismatch and misloading. Results suggest that this phenomenon is sufficiently important to affect whole organism phenotypes, as shown by correlations with pathologies and morphological estimates of developmental stability.",

Three novel propensity scales namely, BTMC, BTMI and HTMI were derived for the TMB residues at the hydrophobic core region of the outer membrane (OM), the lipid–water interface regions of the OM, and for the helical membrane proteins (HMPs) residues at the lipid–water interface regions of the inner membrane (IM), respectively. Separate propensity scales were derived for monomeric and functionally oligomeric TMBs. The derived propensities reflect differing physico-chemical properties of the respective membrane bilayer regions and were employed in a computational method for the prediction of the exposure status of TMB residues. Based on the these propensities, the conservation indices and the frequency profile of the residues, the transmembrane residues were classified into buried/exposed with an accuracy of 77.91% and 80.42% for the residues at the membrane core and the interface regions, respectively.

The glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes are one of the important supergene families that are involved in protecting the organism from oxidative stress and xenobiotics including the acaricides. The analysis of GST supergene family from Ixodes identified all the three broad GST classes, viz. canonical, mitochondrial, and microsomal forms. In total, 35 GST genes belong to five different canonical GST classes, namely Delta (7 genes), Epsilon (5), Mu (14), Omega (3), and Zeta (3 genes) GST classes, and two mitochondrial Kappa class GST genes, and a single microsomal GST gene were found. Interestingly, Delta- and Epsilon-class members, which are thought to be specific to the class Insecta, were also identified in Ixodes. Further, vertebrate/mammalian specific Mu-GSTs (14 genes) were also identified in Ixodes. Analyses of the intron–exon organization revealed higher frequency of phase ‘0’ and phase ‘2’ introns. The comprehensive listing of the GST supergene family members from Ixodes may help in understanding molecular mechanisms of the acaricide resistance in mites and ticks.

In this article a combined classifier based on the information content of extracted features from the primary structure of protein has been introduced to face this challenging problem. In the first stage of our proposed two-tier architecture, there are several classifiers each of which is trained with a different sequence based feature vector. Apart from the application of the predicted secondary structure, hydrophobicity, van der Waals volume, polarity, polarizability, and different dimensions of pseudo-amino acid composition vectors in similar studies, the position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) has also been used to improve the correct classification rate (CCR) in this study. Using K-fold cross validation on training dataset related to 27 famous folds of SCOP, the 28 dimensional probability output vector from each evidence theoretic K-NN classifier is used to determine the information content or expertness of corresponding feature for discrimination in each fold class. In the second stage, the outputs of classifiers for test dataset are fused using Sugeno fuzzy integral operator to make better decision for target fold class. The expertness factor of each classifier in each fold class has been used to calculate the fuzzy integral operator weights. Results make it possible to provide deeper interpretation about the effectiveness of each feature for discrimination in target classes for query proteins.",

Among them 64 genes were selected to construct glucosinolate network because their individual connection to at least one known glucosinolate gene was predicted by all the software tools. Microarray data of candidate gene mutants were used for validation of the results. The mutants of nine genes predicted by glucosinolate seed genes all exhibited changes in the expression of glucosinolate genes. Four of the genes have been well-known to functionally interact with glucosinolate biosynthesis. These results indicate that the approach we took provides a powerful way to reveal new players in glucosinolate networks. Creation of an in silico network of glucosinolate biosynthesis will allow the generation of many testable hypotheses and ultimately enable predictive biology.",

A growing trend is to regard protein fold space as a continuum rather than a series of discrete structures. From this perspective, homologous protein structures within the same functional classification should reveal a constant rate of structural drift relative to sequence changes. The clusters of orthologous groups (COG) classification system was used to annotate homologous bacterial protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The structures and sequences of proteins within each COG were compared against each other to establish their relatedness. As expected, the analysis demonstrates a sharp structural divergence between the bacterial phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Additionally, each COG had a distinct sequence/structure relationship, indicating that different evolutionary pressures affect the degree of structural divergence. However, our analysis also shows the relative drift rate between sequence identity and structure divergence remains constant.",

     "abstract": "Affected relatives are essential for pedigree linkage analysis, however, they cause a violation of the independent sample assumption in case–control association studies. To avoid the correlation between samples, a common practice is to take only one affected sample per pedigree in association analysis. Although several methods exist in handling correlated samples, they are still not widely used in part because these are not easily implemented, or because they are not widely known. We advocate the effective sample size method as a simple and accessible approach for case–control association analysis with correlated samples. This method modifies the chi-square test statistic, p-value, and 95% confidence interval of the odds-ratio by replacing the apparent number of allele or genotype counts with the effective ones in the standard formula, without the need for specialized computer programs. We present a simple formula for calculating effective sample size for many types of relative pairs and relative sets. For allele frequency estimation, the effective sample size method captures the variance inflation exactly. For genotype frequency, simulations showed that effective sample size provides a satisfactory approximation. A gene which is previously identified as a type 1 diabetes susceptibility locus, the interferon-induced helicase gene (IFIH1), is shown to be significantly associated with rheumatoid arthritis when the effective sample size method is applied. This significant association is not established if only one affected sib per pedigree were used in the association analysis. Relationship between the effective sample size method and other methods – the generalized estimation equation, variance of eigenvalues for correlation matrices, and genomic controls – are discussed.",

One more methene group in the side chain of Q64 of hCA VII makes it possible to form the hydrogen bond with the bromide atom of the known inhibitor. From the point of view, the modification to the known inhibitor was performed to obtain an inhibitor with higher selectivity. The complex conformations of the new designed inhibitor and two isozymes designate the formation of the hydrogen bond between the newly added group (hydroxypropyl group) and Q64 of hCA VII but N67 of hCA II. The results of the binding free energy from the MM/PBSA approach also prove the selectivity improvement of the new inhibitor in comparison with the known inhibitor.

     "abstract": "We develop here a new class of stochastic models of gene evolution based on residue Insertion–Deletion Independent from Substitution (IDIS). Indeed, in contrast to all existing evolution models, insertions and deletions are modeled here by a concept in population dynamics. Therefore, they are not only independent from each other, but also independent from the substitution process.After a separate stochastic analysis of the substitution and the insertion–deletion processes, we obtain a matrix differential equation combining these two processes defining the IDIS model. By deriving a general solution, we give an analytical expression of the residue occurrence probability at evolution time t as a function of a substitution rate matrix, an insertion rate vector, a deletion rate and an initial residue probability vector. Various mathematical properties of the IDIS model in relation with time t are derived: time scale, time step, time inversion and sequence length. Particular expressions of the nucleotide occurrence probability at time t are given for classical substitution rate matrices in various biological contexts: equal insertion rate, insertion–deletion only and substitution only. All these expressions can be directly used for biological evolutionary applications.The IDIS model shows a strongly different stochastic behavior from the classical substitution only model when compared on a gene dataset. Indeed, by considering three processes of residue insertion, deletion and substitution independently from each other, it allows a more realistic representation of gene evolution and opens new directions and applications in this research field.",

Thus a full understanding of the transcriptional gene regulation system will depend on successful functional analyses of cis-acting elements.Cis-acting regulatory elements present within the 5′ regulatory region of the sucrose transporter gene families in rice (Oryza sativa Japonica cultivar-group) and Arabidopsis thaliana, were identified using a bioinformatics approach.The possible cis-acting regulatory elements were predicted by scanning 1.5 kbp of 5′ regulatory regions of the sucrose transporter genes translational start sites, using Plant CARE, PLACE and Genomatix Matinspector professional databases.Several cis-acting regulatory elements that are associated with plant development, plant hormonal regulation and stress response were identified, and were present in varying frequencies within the 1.5 kbp of 5′ regulatory region, among which are; A-box, RY, CAT, Pyrimidine-box, Sucrose-box, ABRE, ARF, ERE, GARE, Me-JA, ARE, DRE, GA-motif, GATA, GT-1, MYC, MYB, W-box, and I-box.

     "abstract": "Over the past ten years, a variety of microRNA target prediction methods has been developed, and many of the methods are constantly improved and adapted to recent insights into miRNA–mRNA interactions. In a typical scenario, different methods return different rankings of putative targets, even if the ranking is reduced to selected mRNAs that are related to a specific disease or cell type. For the experimental validation it is then difficult to decide in which order to process the predicted miRNA–mRNA bindings, since each validation is a laborious task and therefore only a limited number of mRNAs can be analysed. We propose a new ranking scheme that combines ranked predictions from several methods and – unlike standard thresholding methods – utilises the concept of Pareto fronts as defined in multi-objective optimisation. In the present study, we attempt a proof of concept by applying the new ranking scheme to hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-125b, and hsa-miR-373 and prediction scores supplied by PITA and RNAhybrid. The scores are interpreted as a two-objective optimisation problem, and the elements of the Pareto front are ranked by the STarMir score with a subsequent re-calculation of the Pareto front after removal of the top-ranked mRNA from the basic set of prediction scores. The method is evaluated on validated targets of the three miRNA, and the ranking is compared to scores from DIANA-microT and TargetScan. We observed that the new ranking method performs well and consistent, and the first validated targets are elements of Pareto fronts at a relatively early stage of the recurrent procedure, which encourages further research towards a higher-dimensional analysis of Pareto fronts.",

A crucial part in the gene structure prediction is to determine the splice sites in the coding region. Identification of splice sites depends on the precise recognition of the boundaries between exons and introns of a given DNA sequence. This problem can be formulated as a classification of sequence elements into ‘exon–intron’ (EI), ‘intron–exon’ (IE) or ‘None’ (N) boundary classes. In this study we propose a new Weighted Position Specific Scoring Method (WPSSM) to recognize splice sites which uses a position-specific scoring matrix constructed by nucleotide base frequencies. A genetic algorithm is used in order to tune the weight and threshold parameters of the positions on. This method consists of two phases: learning phase and identification phase. The proposed WPSS method poses efficient results compared with the performance of many methods proposed in the literature.

Several ambitious sRNA projects have been established based on the technical support of NGS. Thanks to the high-throughput feature of NGS, huge amounts of sRNA sequencing data have been generated. However, much more research efforts are needed to further exploit these valuable data. In this study, we carried out functional analyses of sRNAs from 26 angiosperms by utilizing public sRNA NGS data. We proposed that the endogenous sRNAs largely represented by the 24-nt ones had a potential role in transposable element (TE) control in both Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa), based on the comparison of sRNA locus densities within the TEs to the non-TE genes. Functional analysis was performed for the predicted targets of the conserved sRNAs that were classified into eudicot-specific, monocot-specific, and angiosperm-conserved ones. Moreover, several miRNA families were found to be highly conserved, and miR396 was suggested to be the most conserved miRNA family between the eudicots and the monocots, indicating its essential role in angiosperm development. At last, we demonstrated that it was a great challenge for researchers to fully exploit these huge sRNA NGS datasets and numerous sRNA species remained to be uncovered and functionally characterized.",

Thus the sample of a protein is represented by a set of discrete components which incorporate both the sequence order and the length effect. On the basis of such a statistical framework a simple radial basis function network based classifier is introduced to predict protein structural class.

Being able to compute such measures is of paramount importance in data mining, model development, and model comparison.

These primate-specific miRNAs (ps-miRNAs) may attribute to the difference between high-level primates and non-primate mammals or lower vertebrates. Despite of their importance, the genome-wide miRNA conservation patterns and the properties of these ps-miRNAs are largely elusive.In this study, we developed a robust classification system to assess the conservation pattern of all human mature miRNAs across 44 vertebrate genomes. By this comparative genomic analysis, a novel set of 269 ps-miRNAs were identified. We found that many ps-miRNAs were enriched in chromosome 19 and X, forming two main clusters hereafter referred as C19MC and CXMC, respectively. When comparing the seed of ps-miRNAs themselves or with non-ps-miRNAs, more than one half ps-miRNAs sharing common seeds were belonged to C19MC, 9 of which retained a unique seed that had been reported to be enriched in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) specific miRNAs. Moreover, the most abundant ps-miRNA common seed was possessed by miR-548 family. Most ps-miRNAs had very low expression in adult tissues, which may be attributed to temporal and spatial specific transcript regulation. The ps-miRNAs with relatively high expression were mainly belonged to C19MC and CXMC, and preferentially expressed in hESCs and reproductive system. Sequence anatomy revealed that C19MC ps-miRNAs were highly conserved but not beyond primates and of great sequence similarity. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of predicted target genes indicated that C19MC ps-miRNAs were strongly associated with developmental processes and various cancers.In conclusion, ps-miRNAs may play critical roles in differentiation and growth regulation during early development, especially in maintaining the pluripotency of hESCs.

     "abstract": "We study how long pause-prone sites, commonly sequence-dependent, affect transcription and RNA temporal levels in a delayed stochastic model of transcription at the single nucleotide level. We vary pause propensity, duration and the probability of premature termination of elongation at the pause site. We also study the effects of multiple pause sites. We show that pause sites can be used to fine-tune noise strength and burst size distribution of RNA levels. Varying pause rate and duration alone affects bursting but noise is not significantly affected. Noise strength can be changed by varying both parameters and, even more pronouncedly, by varying the probability of premature termination. Adding multiple pause sites amplifies the increase in noise and bursting. This regulatory mechanism of noise and bursting, being evolvable, may partially explain how different genes exhibit a wide spectrum of different behaviors. The results might assist the engineering of genes with a desired degree of noise.",

     "abstract": "The problem of finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) for an arbitrary number of sequences is a very interesting and challenging problem in computer science. This problem is NP-complete, but because of its importance, many heuristic algorithms have been proposed, such as Long Run, Expansion Algorithm and THSB. However, the performance, either in result quality or in process time, of many current heuristic algorithms deteriorates fast when the number of sequences and sequence length increase. In this paper, we have proposed a post-process heuristic algorithm for the LCS problem, the Deposition and Extension Algorithm (DEA). This algorithm first generates common subsequence by “sequence deposition” based on fine tuning of search range, and then extends this common subsequence. The algorithm is proven to generate Common Subsequences (CSs) with guaranteed lengths. The experiments on different dataset showed that the results of DEA algorithm were better than those of Long Run and Expansion Algorithm, especially on many long sequences. The algorithm also had superior efficiency both in time and memory space.",

Some divergence was observed between expression distributions based on sequence count of the most abundant isomiR and sum of all isomiR sequence counts, respectively. But the divergence showed less effect on expression patterns in miRNA gene cluster and family. Because of high sensitivity of sequencing technology and ambiguous distribution of common isomiRs among multicopy miRNA precursors and homologous genes, most gene clusters and families showed inconsistent expression levels. Inconsistent expression pattern implied expression diversification in vivo although they maybe showed close relationship during transcription and/or gene regulation. Some gene clusters and families generated mature miRNAs from the same arms and even with the same lengths, especially in gene family. The interesting expression and length distribution maybe implied strict regulation during pre-miRNA processing through cleavage of Dicer and Drosha.

     "abstract": "In a fine-grained computational analysis of protein structure, we investigated the relationships between a residue's backbone conformations and its side-chain packing as well as conformations. To produce continuous distributions in high resolution, we ran molecular dynamics simulations over a set of protein folds (dynameome). In effect, the dynameome dataset samples not only the states well represented in the PDB but also the known states that are not well represented in the structural database. In our analysis, we characterized the mutual influence among the backbone ϕ,ψ angles with the first side-chain torsion angles (χ1) and the volumes occupied by the side-chains. The dependencies of these relationships on side-chain environment and amino acids are further explored. We found that residue volumes exhibit dependency on backbone 2° structure conformation: side-chains pack more densely in extended β-sheet than in α-helical structures. As expected, residue volumes on the protein surface were larger than those in the interior. The first side-chain torsion angles are found to be dependent on the backbone conformations in agreement with previous studies, but the dynameome dataset provides higher resolution of rotamer preferences based on the backbone conformation. All three gauche−, gauche+, and trans rotamers show different patterns of ϕ,ψ dependency, and variations in χ1 value are skewed from their canonical values to relieve the steric strains. By demonstrating the utility of dynameomic modeling on the native state ensemble, this study reveals details of the interplay among backbone conformations, residue volumes and side-chain conformations.",

     "abstract": "With the proliferation of related microarray studies by independent groups, a natural approach to analysis would be to combine the results across studies. In this article, we address a meta-analysis of the gene expression data on imatinib resistance in chronic myelogenous leukemia. First, an analysis of the overlapping among 6 published studies revealed that only 3 genes were coincident between 2 studies. A later reprocessing using different methods on 4 publicly available datasets revealed that 2 extra genes were overlapped between two sets. Both poor overlappings may be due to large differences in the sample source, the microarray platforms used, and a small difference in gene expression between the imatinib non-responder and responder patients. A search of common genes inside 4 public datasets afforded 404 well defined genes. Nevertheless, this necessary condition for meta-analysis caused the loss of many genes of possible interest. The expression signals of the common genes in the four datasets were reanalyzed using three summary statistical methods for combining quantitative information: Fisher, Stouffer and effect-size. Taking the three methods together and using an FDR < 0.10 threshold, a gene-list with 33 differentially expressed genes was found. Considering all the reanalysis approaches used in this work, a final gene-list with 38 differentially expressed genes is reported. Despite the important limitations to this microarray meta-analysis, the presented procedures and integrated gene-list may have some potential value as regards imatinib resistance in CML patients since it is the first attempt to integrate evidence about gene-lists in this area.",

The expression of only few genes have to be known to model the global stress response of all but a few atypical responder genes. Those required genes and the atypical response genes are shown to be good biomarker for tox predictions. In total, 138 experiments and 13 different compounds were used to train models for different toxicity classes. The deduced biomarkers were shown to be biologically plausible. A neural network was trained to predict the toxic effects of compounds from profiling experiments. On a validation data set of 189 experiments with 16 different compounds the accuracy of the predictions was assessed: 14 out of 16 compounds have been classified correctly.

Additional information is provided by cis-acting regulatory sequences that serve to enhance or repress splicing, and that may be exonic or intronic in nature: the splicing enhancers and the splicing silencers, respectively. In this study, we tested by computational and statistical approaches if the exonic splicing enhancer motif binding to the SF2/ASF SR protein is conserved among several groups of human genes. The results showed that the SF2/ASF ESE consensus was conserved between genes within the same chromosome, within different chromosomes and between different levels of muscular cells differentiation. However, this motif displays subtle variations within the consensus sequence between genes expressed in different tissues. These results can emphasize the presence of different translational isoforms of the SFRS1 gene encoding for the SF2/ASF, or different post-translational protein maturations in different tissues.

Expected effects are weak, but are apparent in 14 among 16 independent taxonomic groups for the non-coding +1 frame, and 12 among 16 for the −1 frame. Results stress that many molecular factors determine phenotypes in a complex manner, frequently undetectable by classical quantitative genetics. Explicit molecular hypotheses can partially palliate this shortcoming, and uncover unsuspected links between genotype and phenotype, especially when molecular epistasis (here interactions between hidden stops and ribosomes), is involved. Effects of hidden stops on morphological developmental stability suggest that mitochondrial off frame stops might also affect human cumulative neurodegenerative diseases.

The population is divided into households of various sizes and also based on commuting status.

Following the general SLIR models, the population is further segmented into susceptible (S), exposed/latently infected (L), active/infectious (I), and recovered (R) individuals. During the daytime, commuters travel on public transport, while non-commuters randomly interact in the community to mimic chance encounters with infectious persons. At night, each family interacts and sleeps together in the home. The risk of exposure to TB is based on the proximity, duration, and frequency of encounters with infectious persons. The model is applied to a hypothetical population to explore the effects of different intervention strategies including vaccination, wearing of masks during the commute, prophylactic treatment of latent infections and more effective case-finding and treatment. The most important findings of the model are: (1) members of larger families are responsible for more disease transmissions than those from smaller families, (2) daily commutes on public transport provide ideal conditions for transmission of the disease, (3) improved diagnosis and treatment has the greatest impact on the spread of the disease, and (4) detecting TB at the first clinic visit, when patients are still smear negative, is key.",

We first extract some potential transcriptional regulatory motifs based on a statistical comparative analysis. 98% of these motifs are accordance with experimental analyses. Then by pairing these motifs each other, we identify some potential synergistic motif pairs between upstream regions and introns of yeast RP genes (RPGs). Among 48 detected motif pairs, 44 match the binding sites for interacting transcriptional factors known from experiments or predictions. Checking the positions of these motif pairs in yeast RPGs, it is found that both motifs of the detected motif pairs are enriched in specific regions of upstream regions and introns, respectively. Some motif pairs present distance and orientation preferences, which may be favorable for transcription factors to bind simultaneously to DNA.

     "abstract": "The traditional experimental practice in enzyme kinetics involves the measurement of substrate or product concentrations as a function of time. Advances in computing have produced novel approaches for modeling enzyme catalyzed reactions from time course data. One example of such an approach is the selection of appropriate chemical reactions that best fit the data. A common limitation of this approach resides in the number of chemical species considered. The number of possible chemical reactions grows exponentially with the number of chemical species, which makes difficult to select reactions that uniquely describe the data and diminishes the efficiency of the methods. In addition, a method’s performance is also dependent on several quantitative and qualitative properties of the time course data, of which we know very little. This information is important to experimentalists as it could allow them to setup their experiments in ways that optimize the network reconstruction. We have previously described a method for inferring reaction mechanisms and kinetic rate parameters from time course data. Here, we address the limitations in the number of chemical reactions by allowing the introduction of information about chemical interactions. We also address the unknown properties of the input data by determining experimental data properties that maximize our method’s performance. We investigate the following properties: initial substrate–enzyme concentration ratios; initial substrate–enzyme concentration variation ranges; number of data points; number of different experiments (time courses); and noise. We test the method using data generated in silico from the Michaelis–Menten and the Hartley–Kilby reaction mechanisms. Our results demonstrate the importance of experimental design for time course assays that has not been considered in experimental protocols.

We developed an algorithm to accomplish this goal based on the Damped Least Squares (DLS) inversion method and then tested the effectiveness of this method on the McKillop–Geeves (MG) model of thin filament regulation. The kinetics of MG model is defined by a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that predict the evolution of troponin–tropomyosin–actin and actin–myosin states. The values of the rate constants are estimated by integrating these ODEs numerically and fitting them to a series of stopped-flow pyrene fluorescence transients of myosin-S1 fragment binding to regulated actin in solution. The accuracy and robustness of the estimated rate constants are evaluated for DLS and two other methods, namely quasi-Newton (QN) and simulated annealing (SA). The comparison of these methods revealed that SA provides the best estimates of the model parameters because of its global optimization scheme. However it converges slowly and does quantify the uniqueness of the estimated parameters. On the other hand the QN method converges rapidly but only if the initial guess of the parameters is close to the optimum values, otherwise it diverges. Overall, the DLS method proves to be the most convenient method. It converges fast and was able to provide excellent estimates of kinetic parameters. Furthermore, DLS provides the model resolution matrix, which quantifies the interdependence of model parameters thereby evaluating the uniqueness of their estimated values. This property is essential for estimating of the dependence of the model parameters on experimental conditions (e.g. Ca2+ concentration) when it is assessed from noisy experimental data such as pyrene fluorescence from stopped-flow transients. The advantages of the DLS method observed in this study should be further examined in other physicochemical systems to firmly establish the observed effectiveness of DSL vs. the other parameter estimation methods.",

Our analysis also reveals the previously not described basic cluster 343R–345K (16.1% of interactions) and 373K (3.2%) and the acidic clusters 113D–115E–116E (25.8%), 92E–93E (12.9%), 101D (3.2%) and 179E (3.2%).Cluster pairings among the previously defined charge clusters include the pairing of cluster 421K–422R to cluster 207D–208D–209D. Moreover, 433K–434R and 207D–208D–209D, respectively the dominant positively and negatively charged clusters, are uncorrelated. Instead our analysis suggests that the newly identified cluster 113D–115E–116E is the main partner of the 433K–434R cluster while the newly described cluster 343R–345K is correlated to the cluster 207D–208D–209D.",

     "abstract": "In vitro molecular evolution creates a lot of peptide aptamers that bind to each target protein. In many cases, their binding sites on a protein surface are not known. Then, predicting the binding sites through computation within a reasonable time is desirable. With this aim, we have developed a novel system of fast and robust blind docking of a peptide to a fixed protein structure at low computational costs. Our algorithm is based on the following scheme. Representing each of the amino acid residues by a single point corresponding to its side-chain center, the structure of a target protein and that of a ligand peptide are coarse-grained. The peptide, which is described as a flexible bead model, is movable along the grid-points which are set surrounding the protein. An arbitrary state of the protein–peptide complex is subjected to Delaunay tessellation. Then, the fitness of a peptide-coordination to the protein is measured by a four-body statistical pseudo-potential. Through 1000 trials of a simple hill-climbing optimization, the best 15 peptide-coordinations with the 1st–15th highest fitness values are selected as candidates for the putative coordination. Retrieving the available 28 protein–peptide complexes from the Protein Databank, we carried out the blind docking test for each system. The best 15 peptide-coordinations fell into several clusters by the cluster analysis based on their spatial distribution. We found that, in most cases, the largest cluster or second largest cluster correspond to nearly correct binding sites, and that the mean ( ± standard deviation) of GTGD over all the 28 cases is 4.8 Å( ± 3.8 Å), where GTGD represents the distance from the putative binding site to the correct binding site.",

     "abstract": "Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) is a powerful tool to obtain gene expression profiles. Clustering analysis is a valuable technique for analyzing SAGE data. In this paper, we propose an adaptive clustering method for SAGE data analysis, namely, PoissonAPS. The method incorporates a novel clustering algorithm, Affinity Propagation (AP). While AP algorithm has demonstrated good performance on many different data sets, it also faces several limitations. PoissonAPS overcomes the limitations of AP using the clustering validation measure as a cost function of merging and splitting, and as a result, it can automatically cluster SAGE data without user-specified parameters. We evaluated PoissonAPS and compared its performance with other methods on several real life SAGE datasets. The experimental results show that PoissonAPS can produce meaningful and interpretable clusters for SAGE data.",
