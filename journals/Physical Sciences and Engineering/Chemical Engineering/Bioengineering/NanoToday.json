     "abstract": "The dynamics of single molecules are critical in determining how biological systems function. The number of measurement techniques to image and characterise single molecules is growing rapidly, however very few techniques are applicable in biologically relevant settings. Here, I provide a perspective on a relatively new field of research focused on the development of diamond-based quantum probes to measure the dynamics of single paramagnetic molecules in ambient aqueous solutions. The magnetic sensitivity of these quantum probes coupled with the biocompatible sensing platform offers a potential pathway towards 3D single molecule microscopy.",

     "abstract": "Nanotechnology is expected to transform biomedical sectors providing more sensitive and specific imaging techniques, nano-devices and nano-robotics for early detection of biochemical changes, targeted and less toxic drug treatments, as well as enhanced supports for regenerative medicine. Although beneficial, some concerns have emerged on the possible adverse impact that nano-enabled applications may have on human health, particularly on workers exposed throughout the product life cycle, due to the still unpredictable toxicological behavior of nano-sized materials. Therefore, for biomedical nano-technological applications to be considered for a “responsible benchtop to the bedside” translation, occupational health implications should be carefully addressed.",

     "abstract": "Catalytic materials are an essential component of the chemical industry. They find applications in everything from fine chemical manufacturing to greenhouse gas mitigation. They are indispensable for developing a sustainable future. Their development has been continuous, from early trial and error efforts to the first fundamental insights gained through surface science, to modern in-situ characterization and computational predictions. The accumulation of knowledge on the working principles of catalytic surfaces allowed designing and producing better systems with improved performance. Even though tremendous progress has been made thanks to surface science techniques, these studies are usually performed under ultra-high vacuum and are therefore limited in their applicability to more relevant industrial conditions. The control over size, shape and composition in colloidal nanocrystals makes them formidable precursors for model heterogeneous catalysts. These model systems enable linking the insights from surface science studies via in-situ and operando studies to realistic catalytic reaction conditions. In this review, colloidal nanocrystals are presented as powerful building blocks for catalytic materials in the quest for fundamental understanding. A review of the principal methods to produce colloidal nanocrystals with a high level of control is reported, complemented by procedures for how to prepare active catalysts from these particles. Examples and guidelines for the catalytic applications of these materials revolve around the three guiding objectives in catalysis science: activity, selectivity and stability. This work will be limited to examples of this colloidal approach in the areas of thermal, electro- and photocatalysis. The exposed approaches can be used and extended to many other areas of catalysis science, thus providing a new avenue to explore fundamentals and applications of catalytic materials.",

     "abstract": "The binary cooperative complementary phenomenon refers to two opposite but cooperative and complementary species or states, which can be observed from atom scale to universe. When binary cooperative complementary pairs in nanoscale are separated by a related characteristic physical distance, the electron and energy transfer through interface can be well tuned, consequently the macroscopic property of a nanomaterial can be highly enhanced, such materials are defined as binary cooperative complementary interfacial nanomaterials (BCCINMs). A variety of BCCINMs have been developed and exhibited outstanding performance. In this review, for fabrication, various binary cooperative complementary pairs are summarized, the obtained BCCINMs and building blocks are classified into 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D materials, some effective methods and advices are also given. In the following, various properties and applications of existing BCCINMs are introduced. In the next part, BCCINMs are extended, multiple binary cooperative complementary pairs and smart BCCINMs are introduced. Moreover, temporal and spatial regulation is also essential for BCCINMs such as bulk heterojunctions and core-shell quantum dots. There is plenty of room at the bottom for BCCINMs, in the future, more binary cooperative complementary pairs should be employed, effective methods should be created and applied to assemble binary cooperative complementary pairs with suitable distribution size and for spatial and temporal regulation.",

     "abstract": "Printing of binder-free graphene electrodes directly on substrates has the potential to enable a large number of applications. Though conventional processing techniques such as ink-jet, screen-printing, and roll coating methods offer reliable and scalable fabrication, device performance has often been limited by re-stacking of the graphene sheets and by presence of passive binders and or additives. Laser-based, direct-write technologies have shown promise as a reliable, maskless, and template-free patterning method. Thus, laser-derived graphene (LDG) electrode is emerging as a promising three-dimensional graphene electrode that can be simultaneously derived from precursor carbons or polymers and patterned upon laser exposure. The LDG can be obtained through irradiation by a variety of laser sources including CO2 infrared laser and femtosecond laser pulses, depending on the nature of the starting carbon precursors. Controlling the microstructure, amount and types of doping, and post-deposition methods enable a variety of applications including energy storage, catalysis, sensing and biomedicine. In this review article, we discuss recent progress in using laser-based fabrication of printed 3D graphene electrodes and its wide spectrum of applications. The review also discusses the material aspects of 3D graphene electrodes and provides an outlook for future potential.",

This review article comprehensively summarizes the recent developments in synthetic methods, including the hard template strategy, soft template strategy, and template-free strategy for successful preparation of PCNs. Three representative electrochemical applications of such PCNs materials for lithium ion batteries, supercapacitors, and electrocatalytic oxygen reductions are presented.

     "abstract": "Optical imaging represents one of the most essential tools in biological studies. Although with great advances, bio-optical imaging still suffers from problems such as resolution, sensitivity, speed, and penetration depth. Due to the unique optical properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), i.e., surface plasmon resonance, AuNPs can be readily used to enhance optical imaging based on their absorption, scattering, fluorescence, Raman scattering, etc. Here, we include the most recent achievements and challenges associated with using AuNPs to improve resolution and sensitivity in biological imaging in vitro and in vivo. The application of AuNPs in the following three aspects were discussed: 1) Direct visualization of AuNPs inside the biosystems using i) dark field (DF) microscopy, ii) differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, and iii) other techniques, such as interferometric scattering (iSCAT) microscopy and photothermal imaging. Additionally, since orientation and rotational motions are closely related to various biological processes, we also summarized the recent advances of optical imaging methods in the rotational and orientation tracking of AuNPs. 2) Monitoring of biomolecular events and physiological processes using i) surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and ii) plasmon enhanced fluorescence (PEF) for ultra-sensitive detection of biomolecules, including proteins, metabolites, DNA, RNA, etc. 3) In vivo deep tissue imaging using i) two-photon and/or multi-photon imaging, ii) optical coherence tomography (OCT), and iii) photoacoustic (PA) imaging for disease diagnoses, such as detecting tumors and other diseases in eye, brain, and bone. In conclusion, based on our literature study, AuNPs-assisted bioimaging acts as a promising tool in exploring fundamental biological questions and early diagnosis of diseases.",

In this review, we elaborate the importance of improved understanding of EHS of ENMs for the sustainable development of nano-industries. Based on our analysis of the current knowledge gaps and challenges in nano-EHS research, we propose that future research directions should mainly focus on: elucidating the impacts of environmental exposure, transport, transformation and fate of EMMs on their toxicity and health risks; identifying more appropriate assays and biomarkers for ENMs risk assessment framework; taking a systems innovation approach for scaling up from laboratory to industrial level.",

     "abstract": "Messenger RNA based therapeutics have the potential to cause a big revolution in medicine as they can facilitate personalized medicines and allow patients to produce their own therapeutic proteins without the current purification, solubility and inappropriate glycosylation issues associated with recombinant therapeutic proteins. Moreover, a generic and much cheaper production process can be used for mRNA therapeutics as the physicochemical properties of mRNA are independent of its sequence. Furthermore, mRNA vaccines will allow us to respond much quicker to epidemic outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases as their production is much faster and more flexible than the production of the current vaccines. In the past, the in vivo delivery of mRNA therapeutics was considered as a major bottleneck. However, very recently it has been demonstrated that in vivo delivery issues like low cellular uptake and in vivo degradation by nucleases can be overcome by formulating the therapeutic mRNA into nanoparticles. In this review, we describe the different synthetic mRNA platforms, their production and purification, strategies to tackle the inherent innate immunogenicity of synthetic mRNA, the recent progress in the development of nanoformulations for the in vivo delivery of mRNA, as well as the efficacy and safety of mRNA therapeutics in recent clinical trials.",

     "abstract": "Polypeptides and proteins have a high density of chemical functionality, which can be used to construct defined macromolecular nano architectures, such as low dimensional assemblies (i.e., nanoparticles, nanofibers and nanotubes), two-dimensional nanosheets, and extended three-dimensional structures (i.e., crystalline solids). Two-dimensional nanosheets are a fundamentally important geometry that bridges the gap between low dimensional assemblies and three-dimensional structures. In view of the considerable impact on a great many fundamental and applied aspects of biological and material sciences, it is therefore significant and valuable to review the recent works related to this field. In recent years, a central goal is to design novel materials with molecular-level information that can be utilized to direct highly specific intra- and intermolecular interactions promoting self-assembly of thermodynamically stable and structurally defined two-dimensional (2D) assemblies. In this review, we present a variety of strategies for constructing the 2D nanoscale assemblies and nanomaterials using specific interactions of polypeptides or similar peptoid molecules in a well-predictable manner. These controllable 2D nanomaterials can also display a variety of functionalities. Initially, the primary and secondary structure of peptides will be introduced. Examples of controlled fabrication of two-dimensional assemblies on the nanoscale are subsequently presented based on different secondary structures of the peptides, e.g. two-dimensional crystals from α-helix, nanoscale sheets from self-assembly of collagen-mimetic peptides with triple helix, co-assembled nanosheet structures assembled from peptide-organic molecules with β-strand conformation, and 2D crystals assembled from peptoid with Σ-strand structure. Furthermore, macrofilms assembled from protein fibril arrays are introduced. These bottom-up strategies can arrange polypeptides and proteins into well-ordered 2D structures, which can have wide-ranging applications, such as membrane-based separations with specific mechanical properties, the control of surface properties in nanodevice and nanosensor fabrication, retroviral transduction in biology and diagnosis of some disease in biomedicine.",

     "abstract": "Organic-inorganic nanocomposite materials have attracted a great attention since they cover a wide range of properties by combining the contrasting properties and/or creating novel properties. Functional properties of composites could further be manipulated by stimuli such as light, pH, magnetic/electric field, mechanical force, and heat. When the stimuli can control a wide range of materials’ property, it can be applied to a device with an ON-OFF system: a switch. A switchable material should exhibit the property that is noticeably different upon stimulation (i.e. ON and OFF states) with reversible mechanism. Research on switchable materials has been actively carried out to maximize the difference between ON and OFF states by modifying the structure and composition of nanocomposites, and also on stimuli to control the response time. Switchable materials find their applications in various fields such as catalysts, sensors, photodetectors, memory devices, and drug delivery systems. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in the design/synthesis of organic-inorganic nanoscale materials in which their properties can be controlled in response to a specific stimulus. In addition, we introduce various stimuli (furthermore, multi-stimuli), applications of switchable nanocomposites in a wide range of fields, and also challenges with an outlook.",

     "abstract": "Carbon dots (CDs) – small crystalline or amorphous carbon-based nanoparticles – have attracted much attention as promising fluorescent materials for a wide range of applications. One of their widely accepted advantages is the simplicity of the formation of highly luminescent CDs from a wide variety of organic precursors. At the same time, several recent studies on these chemically synthesized CDs raised questions about the nature of the resulting products. Their strong fluorescence can arise due to the presence of molecular organic fluorophores, not necessary CDs, as was assumed in the earlier publications. In this review, we consider fundamental characteristics of CDs and discuss several issues that currently prevent a better understanding of their structure-property correlation. Analysis of recent related studies identifying the presence of organic fluorophores in CDs with an emphasis on the optical properties of the synthesis products shows that their emission characteristics may be a complex interplay of stand-alone molecular fluorophores and their aggregates, possibly embedded in an amorphous carbon/polymer network. The review concludes with an outlook towards the challenges in the field of the bottom-up synthesized CDs, and their proper identification within the variety of the organic side-products eventually formed during the synthesis.",

     "abstract": "Studies in surface science have yielded many perspectives and techniques to solve the two biggest issues in the synthesis of two dimensional materials: degradation during transfer and restriction of applying functional substrates. Atomic manipulation of the surface environment is considered as an essential factor to solve these issues. For example, for the synthesis of graphene, an extremely clean surface can modify the substrate catalytic activity, assist uniform nucleation and avoid structural defects, which can improve the quality of graphene. In addition, many surface treatment techniques have shown great potential for achieving smooth and clean surfaces via physical and chemical etching methods while providing sufficient energy for precursors to decompose, which could potentially avoid the transfer process and enable the use of dielectric substrates at low temperatures. In all, an extremely clean surface is key to the success of direct synthesis of high quality 2D materials on functional substrates in different shapes.",

A novel and potential approach to design catalysts based on nonprecious metal encapsulated by two-dimensional (2D) carbon supporting materials has demonstrated unique advantages in terms of enhanced catalytic activity and stability, especially under harsh operational conditions.

Various stakeholders in government and industry have traditionally employed risk assessment quantifying material hazard, exposure, and effects assessments based upon available measurable data to derive safe exposure limits and acceptable environmental releases. This approach forms the foundation of risk-based governance. However, where manufactured nanomaterials do not have robust quantitative data to populate models for evaluation of hazard, exposure and effects, an alternative set of tools is needed for nanomaterial governance. One option is governance using holistic, multi-criteria approaches, which comparatively review risks, benefits, and other implications of nano-enabled products against conventional alternatives. Such multi-criteria approaches are in line with recent calls for research by the European Commission, and are increasingly discussed in scholarly literature.

Scientists and engineers have a tendency to review and envision the future based on the past, but innovation does not work like this. Herein, we do not provide a comprehensive review of nanocomposites with 2D materials; rather, we highlight unusual or unconventional directions emerging for nanocomposite materials research. This forward-looking perspective of current trends focuses on new research directions. In this review, we summarize the fundamentals of nanocomposites in regards to the mechanical and functional reinforcement at the theoretical limit, and we briefly introduce the synthesis of large-area 2D materials with high quality and their controlled dispersion into matrix materials to achieve the maximum reinforcement predicted by theory. We continue with the classical and fundamentally important problem of the mechanical reinforcement in nanocomposites; that is, does the reinforcing contribution come from the modification of matrix or the direct mechanical reinforcement by the nanofillers? We present and discuss new forms of nanocomposites with layered and scrolled structure and well-positioned, semi-infinite 2D layers in detail. We also address the functional reinforcement from the continuous 2D sheets and the unusual applications of nanocomposites enabled by these functional 2D layers. In particular, we discuss fiber devices, such as an electromagnetic inductor and a thermal spiral conductor, an atomic-thick barrier film, a bioactive hybrid via attaching 2D layers to a living organism such as plant leaves, intelligent particle devices acting as state machines, and optical devices such as single photon emitters. With these, we further introduce the new nanocomposite concept of a three-dimensional (3D) macroscopic nanocomposite body comprised exclusively of 2D topology. Finally, we discuss the scalability challenges of the production process and the outlook of potential solutions. We hope this review and perspective can intrigue researchers who are currently working in the fields of 2D materials, polymers, and nanocomposites and provide some new insights to promote the future development of nanocomposites.",

In this regard, nanomedicine strategies have shown significant potential as intensively reported in recent years. In this review, we would like to summarize the latest efforts utilizing nanomedicine to modulate various features within the microenvironment of solid tumors, including tumor hypoxia, tumor pH, the extracellular matrix, as well as the immune microenvironment within the tumor.

The GO-based membranes are classified and presented in three typical forms: single-layered porous GO membranes, few-layered laminated GO membranes, and multi-layered composited GO membranes. More attention is paid to target-oriented preparation strategies for the assembly of GO building blocks, involving multiple interactions and technical advantages, and to the resulting membrane characteristics. The overview also explores the serviceability of these GO-based membranes for full-scale use in environmental practices in gas, water, and biological treatments to pave the way for the promising development and realization of their prospects.",

     "abstract": "Nanophotonics research relies heavily on state-of-the-art and costly nano and microfabrication technologies. While such technologies are fairly mature, their implementation in large-scale manufacturing of photonic devices is not straightforward. This is a major roadblock for integrating nanophotonic functionalities, such as flat optics or high definition, ink-free color printing, into real life applications. In particular, optical metasurfaces – nanoscale textured surfaces with engineered optical properties – hold great potential for a myriad of such applications. Digital laser printing has recently been introduced as a low-cost lithography solution, which allows the fabrication of high-resolution features on optical substrates. By exploiting resonant opto-thermal modification of individual nanoscale elements, laser printing can achieve nanometer-sized resolution. In addition, the concept of digital resonant laser printing at the nanoscale supports mass-customization and may therefore convert nanophotonic science into everyday consumer products.",

Catalytic self-propelled motors have implications for understanding out-of-equilibrium systems and have potential applications in active transport at the nanoscale, where they can be used as motors and pumps. Although much research has been done on micron-sized motors, progress in catalytic nanomotors of sub 100 nm is still in its infancy. These nanosized motors are of great importance for future molecular transport at the cellular level because they operate at length scales at which protein motors work. This opinion article focusses on recent advances in the synthesis of catalytic nanomotors and experimental strategies to measure their self-propulsion, which differ from that of micromotors. Enzymatic and metallic nanomotors are surveyed, together with various theoretical models for self-propulsion. Solutions to current challenges are proposed, which include a chemical synthesis approach, new characterisation of motor activity and potential uses of nanomotors in nanomedicine.",

Nevertheless, challenging issues involving both sulfur cathode and lithium anode hinder their practical applications, which are followed by the extensive research efforts to resolve them. A wide variety of carbon nanomaterials with different characteristics has played an important role in enhancing the performance of LSBs via immobilizing sulfur in cathodes, accommodating the volume expansion of sulfur, enhancing the reaction kinetics and stabilizing lithium anodes. This report overviews the state-of-the-art progress in designing and fabricating nanocarbon for advanced LSBs with particular focuses on the correlations among porosity, electrical conductivity and surface chemistry as some of the most critical factors. More importantly, statistical analysis of electrochemical performance of batteries collected from literatures allows us to identify substantial disparities between the current achievements and the requirements for real-world applications. In an effort to bridge this gap, we highlight recent advances in the design of LSBs with improved sulfur loading, enhanced charge transfer and minimized electrolyte/sulfur ratio.

     "abstract": "It is well established that the high dispersion of active catalyst is vital to determine the performance in heterogeneous catalysis after decades of research on nanomaterials. Since the minimum scale for catalytic species is the single-atom metal with isolated metal atoms singly dispersed on, and/or coordinated with the surface atoms of some suitable supports, explosive growth of research on atomically dispersed metal catalysts has emerged especially in frontier heterogeneous catalysis. Such highly dispersed metallic sites (HDMS) imitate the function of site-directed mutagenesis in enzymology, not only maximizing the efficiency of metal atom of interest, but also offering a possibility to achieve the highest catalytic activity and selectivity and make up the gap between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. However, the formidable challenge lies in that with the decreasing size of metal particles or the decreased coordination of metal atoms, the surface free energy of metals is significantly increased, which would lead to serious aggregation of the intended single-atom dispersed catalysts. Therefore, appropriate approaches to construct HDMS and control the HDMS in good homogeneity are importantly necessary to realize the fantastic catalytic activity of HDMS. Problems lie in how to synthesize precisely site-isolated supported metals and how to make sure the metals bond selectively to specific support surface sites. In this review, we aim to assess the above issues via summarizing the key recent progress on HDMS constructing and controlling in terms of the supports and metal precursors engineering, as well as the known interactions between the support and HDMS. We believe that the summary and discussion in the review will lead to a better understanding of HDMS configuration and constructing, and even shed light on novel design for new HDMS based on the discovered interactions between the support and HDMS. We also give a prospect for the future research on HDMS, with emphasizing on the emergence of new fabrication for HDMS with improved catalysts’ thermal stability and possibility for industrial application.",

Here we introduce the impact that colloidal aggregation has had on early drug discovery, and then turn to the physical and thermodynamic driving forces for small molecule colloidal aggregation, including the particulate nature of the colloids, their critical aggregation concentration-governed formation, their mechanism of protein adsorption and subsequent inhibition, and their sensitivity to detergent.

Thinning metal carbides down to two-dimension can result in nontrivial properties such as superconductivity. The versatile chemistry of metal carbides offers the tunability for applications in Li-ion, Na-ion batteries and supercapacitors. However, from the point of view of surface and interface science, fundamental study at molecular/atomic levels which is crucial for understanding the origin of these superior properties, as well as the mechanism underlying interface catalysis is still missing. Furthermore, deviation of theoretical calculations from real conditions requires the building of model catalysts to mimic surface processes.

     "abstract": "Semiconductive metal oxides are of great importance in environmental remediation and electronics because of their ability to generate charge carriers when excited with appropriate light energy. The electronic structure, light absorption and charge transport properties of the metal oxides have made possible their applications as photocatalysts. Recently, facet-engineering by morphology control has been intensively studied as an efficient approach to further enhance their photocatalytic performance. However, various processing steps and post-treatments used during the preparation of facet-engineered particles may generate different surface active sites which may affect their photocatalysis. Moreover, many traditional techniques (PL, EPR, XPS and Raman) used for materials characterization (oxygen vacancy, hydroxyl group, cation…etc.) are not truly surface specific but the analyses range from top few layers to bulk. Accordingly, they can only provide very limited information on the chemical states of the surface active features and distributions among facets, causing difficulty to unambiguously correlate facet-dependent results with activity. As a result, this always leads to different interpretations amongst researchers during the past decades. In this article, we will review on the controversies generated among researchers, when they correlated the performance of two most popular photocatalysts, ZnO and TiO2 with their facet activities based on characterization from the traditional techniques. As there are shortcomings of these techniques in producing truly facet-dependent features, some results can be misleading and with no cross-literature comparison. This review is also focussed on the new capability of probe-molecule-assisted NMR which allows a genuine differentiation of surface active sites from various facets. This surface-fingerprint technique has been demonstrated to provide both qualitative (chemical shift) and quantitative (peak intensity) information on the concentration and distribution of truly surface features. In light of the new technique this article will revisit the facet-dependent photocatalytic properties and shed light on these issues.",

However, their unique electrochemical behavior involving the formation of dissolved polysulfide intermediate species and the insulating nature of sulfur and Li2S are the main drawbacks that must still be overcome. To tackle these limitations, solutions such as appropriate cathode architecture design, electrolyte optimization, and lithium metal stabilization have been proposed. Recently, high areal sulfur loading, a high sulfur content, and a high electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio have also become prominent issues for the commercialization of the Li–S batteries. This paper reviews a wide range of reports on the design of structural and functional nanomaterials for Li–S batteries and suggests future research directions.",

Interestingly, an increase in the sensitivity factor was observed when increasing the number of nanocubes in the chain and by orienting them in edge-to-edge configuration, with a few exceptions. Additionally, linear chains of edge-to-edge and face-to-face assembled gold nanocube with sub-nanometer interparticle distances (0.2 nm), where the effect of tunneling-induced charge transfer plasmons (tCTPs) becomes significant, was studied using a quantum-corrected model.

Our results suggest that plasmonic coupling in linearly assembled nanoparticles becomes extremely important at sub-nanometer interparticle distances.

To date, various methods have been explored to solving this significant issue. Totally to say, the methods can be classified into two aspects, the traditional size, structure, surface and crystal field controls of the UCNCs, and the novel local electromagnetic field modulation surrounding the UCNCs. The local electromagnetic field modulation on UCNCs is a powerful strategy to enhance the strength/efficiency of UCNCs, reporting enhancement from several times up to four orders in short times.

Plasmonic nanostructures recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventionally used photosensitizers (e.g., organic dyes) that complement semiconductors as they can uniquely harness the energy of visible photons through the excitation of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Provided the solid foundation of the mechanisms with which the plasmonic enhancement effects occur, we herein review the recent progress in the field of plasmonic water splitting by classifying different obstacles and breakthroughs made over the past decade and a half. While plasmonic nanostructures initially served to expand the light harvesting spectrum of semiconductors, rational designs and advanced fabrication techniques have increasingly improved the light absorption capabilities of the plasmonic metal/semiconductor hybrid architectures as a whole. More recently, the use of various analytical tools has allowed a more fundamental issue of short hot carrier lifetime to be tackled which, in turn, has brought about great interest in optimizing the structures and interfaces for more efficient charge transfer. Other issues associated with the field include the complexity of fabrication methods, limited choices in material selection, and cost effectiveness. The review ends with perspectives on future steps to be taken namely the incorporation of co-catalysts, the possibility of using plasmonic heating to assist the catalytic activities, and further investigation of the direct interfacial charge transfer mechanism driven by chemical interface damping (CID).",

To date there is no curative therapy for IBD; therefore life-long medication can be necessary for IBD management if surgery is to be avoided. Drug delivery systems specific to the colon have improved IBD treatment and several such systems are available to patients. However, current delivery systems for IBD do not target drugs to the site of inflammation, which leads to frequent dosing and potentially severe side effects that can adversely impact patients’ adherence to medication. There is a need for novel drug delivery systems that can target drugs to the site of inflammation, prolong local drug availability, improve therapeutic efficacy, and reduce drug side effects. Nanoparticulate (NP) systems are attractive in designing targeted drug delivery systems for the treatment of IBD because of their unique physicochemical properties and capability of targeting the site of disease. This review analyzes the microenvironment at the site of inflammation in IBD, highlighting the pathophysiological features as possible cues for targeted delivery; discusses different strategies and mechanisms of NP targeting IBD, including size-, charge-, ligand-receptor-, degradation- and microbiome-mediated approaches; and summarizes recent progress on using NPs towards improved therapies for IBD.

Plasma proteins on adsorption to surfaces of nanoparticles also play a significant role in complement activation and particularly through the alternative pathway. This process is continuous and changeable in vivo; protein-complement complexes are formed on the nanoparticle surface and then released and the cycle repeats on further plasma protein deposition. This complement activation turnover poses a challenge for design of immune-safe nanomedicines.",

     "abstract": "The notorious PM2.5 (2.5 μm diameter particulate matters) that can reach human lungs, considered as responsible for most deleterious effects of air pollution, are now unmasked. Anthropogenic carbon nanotubes and other carbon nanoparticles have been unambiguously identified as the major components of PM2.5 in alveolar macrophages of Parisian children. Soot and diesel particulate matter have recognized detrimental health effects. However, information on the health effects of anthropogenic carbon nanotubes, which are the main components of PM2.5 found within human alveolar cells, is still lacking. While nanotechnologists are focused on applications with a profit, notably in the field of nano-biomedicine, the health effects of nano-particulate pollutants attract little of their attention. In an attempt to bridge the research gaps between cutting-edge nanotechnologies, environmental studies and biomedical approaches, this opinion paper attempts to inform the nanotechnology community about critical issues related to airborne anthropogenic carbon nanotubes. The question that has to be urgently addressed is whether carbon nanotubes are the main culprit or act only as nano-vectors of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other toxic gaseous pollutants.",

     "abstract": "Supercapacitors are evolving into an important component in energy storage technology with the capability for storing and discharging energy very quickly and effectively. State-of-the-art supercapacitors feature activated carbon electrodes impregnated with a non-aqueous electrolyte (typically acetonitrile) that operate at voltages between 2.2–2.7 V. Unfortunately, activated carbons have low specific capacitance (100–120 F g−1) in organic electrolytes which severely limits the energy density of supercapacitors. In addition, organic solvents are often flammable leading to safety and environmental concerns. Aqueous electrolytes, on the other hand, are safer, cheaper and have higher ionic conductivity, promising higher capacitance electrodes. However, the low voltage window enforced by the low decomposition voltage of water around 1.23 V is a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate symmetric supercapacitors operating at an ultrahigh voltage of 1.8 V that can provide specific electrode capacitances up to 716 F g−1, which is higher than traditional activated carbon electrodes. This is possible through designing both the electrode and electrolyte to work synergistically towards improving not only the capacitance of the electrodes, but also the voltage and cycling stability of the supercapacitor. We also demonstrate by using a simple laser technique the possibility of fabricating micro-supercapacitors with great potential for miniaturized electronics. This work provides an effective strategy for designing and fabricating aqueous supercapacitors that hold promise for a sustainable energy future.",

Therefore, NDDS have been extensively explored in recent years. However, current NDDS did not achieve satisfied clinical therapeutic effect against to tumor treatment. This is mainly ascribed to two reasons. One is that nanocarriers would inevitably encounter a series of physiological and pathological barriers in vivo, leading to low drug transport efficiency. The other is that tumor stroma pose a huge obstruction to tumor therapy, nanotherapeutics just focus on the tumor cells themselves are insufficient for complete tumor eradication. Here in this review, we first outlining sequential biological obstacles encountered by nanocarriers from three levels of blood, tumor tissue and tumor cells. Then, we give a detailed discussion of the role of tumor stroma, and highlight the therapeutic resistances mediated by tumor stroma. In light of these formidable barriers, we provide promising approaches to overcome each barrier or remodel stroma through innovative NDDS design.

Utilising non-traditional methods has the potential to improve the human relevance of nanosafety assessment, reduce the numbers of animals that are used, and shift the paradigm to a ‘21st century’ approach that exploits recent scientific and technological advances. This article considers how application of the 3Rs principles can be used as a framework to support and guide this paradigm shift in the short, medium and long-term. Bringing the community together to facilitate the transition is necessary to ensure that tangible impacts are made on the efficiency and robustness of the nanosafety assessment process.",

     "abstract": "Nanoscale materials have long promised to revolutionize science and technology, with claims being sustained by both the advances in their fabrication and by the many fundamental studies that have been carried out to date, which have revealed fascinating properties when materials dimensions shrink all the way down to a few hundreds/thousands of atoms. In this ongoing hype, on one side we have the futuristic views and promises of ubiquitous devices in which the operating units will be eventually scaled down to individual atoms or molecules. On the other side, we have the more realistic (and already unfolding) scenario represented by nanoscale materials making their way in a wide variety of applications (not always and not necessarily flagged as “high-tech”) where downsizing truly brings about new or improved features that can be immediately exploited for some practical use. These applications have encompassed fields as disparate as medicine, biology, energy conversion and storage, catalysis, sensing, nanocomposite engineering, cosmetics, to cite the most popular ones. For a new technology to be pervasive and disruptive, the costs associated to the fabrication, the characterization and the assemblage of its key components have to drop quickly over time, while at the same time the material quality and the reproducibility of the various processes must keep improving. In the case of nanomaterials, we have not yet witnessed such an ubiquitous revolution, and one of the reasons is probably the lack of straightforward and reproducible synthetic protocols providing large amounts of nanomaterials and thus capable of efficient up-scaling to fulfil industrial needs. Another reason likely resides in the growing concern that nanomaterials will pose new threats to the environment, but this aspect will not be investigated here.In this review, we will touch upon the critical feature of nanomaterials science and engineering dealing with the high throughput synthesis, with a focus on materials prepared in the liquid phase, where the expertise of the authors of this review lays. As a note of caution to the reader, we will not cover in depth all existing approaches to large scale syntheses. Our discussion will be instead a broad summary of the main types of synthetic approaches developed to date, and which we believe will be useful to scientists and engineers who are approaching the fabrication of nanomaterials with an eye on their use in large-scale, industrial applications. The review has been written according to the principle “from the simple to the complex”: it begins with the simplest one-batch heat-up synthesis approach, followed by hot-injection methods and ends by discussing the more sophisticated continuous flow syntheses of nanoparticles. Similarly, in each section, wherever possible, the discussion will start from simpler compounds, (for example, one-component noble metal nanocrystals), and will then move on to more complex structures (from binary to ternary and even quaternary compounds, which will be mainly metal oxides and chalcogenides).",

For example, a seat designed based on the average size of a population will not be suitable for the tallest and the shortest persons. Indeed, by definition an average does not represent extreme values that can be significantly different. The same applies for life sciences as living organisms are made of many cell populations and biological processes are usually investigated globally. Based on a very simplified example, this paper discusses this concept for the particular case of the characterization of the nanoparticle protein corona. Firm conclusions cannot be drawn from the global analysis of samples containing a large number of nanoparticles. It results that in future, different approaches will be required to identify corona subclasses rather than averaging over them. A way to face this challenging task may be through the combined use of different analytical techniques, each shedding light on a different aspect of this complex layer to gain true insight about its nature and dynamics.",

Great efforts have been devoted to fabricating ordered/disordered SiNWs using cost-effective approaches and achieving optimized structural parameters, such as array periodicity, nanowire morphology, length and diameter. Systematic theoretical investigations along with experimental studies on optical and electrical properties of SiNWs have been carried out. These efforts have led to obtaining remarkable improvement of the power conversion efficiency of SiNW solar cells from <1% to >10% in the last few years. However, till now, the power conversion efficiency of these SiNW solar cells is far from satisfactory for any commercial applications compared with the traditional bulk silicon solar cells. Further development of SiNW solar cells requires better understanding of the optical and electrical properties of the nanowire solar cells.

To improve the performance of energy devices, nanomaterials with delicately controlled structures and interfaces have been applied. However, low-dimensional nanomaterials suffer from inhomogeneous aggregation, severe re-stacking, and the formation of bottlenecks and poor contacts during the processing and assembly, thus hindering the transport of electrons or ions in energy devices. Gel materials, a special class of bio-inspired materials, are emerging as promising candidates to overcome the drawbacks of low-dimensional nanomaterials. The 3D nanostructured gel network promotes electron transport along the backbone while facilitating the diffusion of ions through hierarchical pores, as well as providing high surface area for interfacial reactions. In addition, the properties of gels can be facilely tuned, thereby further extending their applications and improving their performance.To date, various synthetic strategies have been developed for the preparation of gel materials, including carbon-based gels, conductive polymer gels, ionically conductive gels and inorganic gels. These gel materials have successfully served as electrode materials, electrolytes, self-supported current collectors, 3D binder systems, etc. in various kinds of energy conversion and storage applications, such as lithium ion batteries, supercapacitors, catalysts, and fuel cells.

Real-world electrocatalysts are usually based on precious metals in the form of nanoparticles due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, which enables better utilization of employed materials. Ability to tailor nanostructure of an electrocatalyst is critical in order to tune their electrocatalytic properties. Over the last decade, that has mainly been achieved through implementation of fundamental studies performed on well-defined extended surfaces with distinct single crystalline and polycrystalline structures. Based on these studies, it has been demonstrated that performance of an electrocatalyst could be significantly changed through the control of size, composition, morphology and architecture of employed nanomaterials. This review outlines the following steps in the process of rational development of an efficient electrocatalyst: 1) electrochemical properties of well-defined surfaces, 2) synthesis and characterization of different classes of electrocatalysts, and 3) correlation between physical properties (size, shape, composition and morphology) and electrochemical behavior (adsorption, electrocatalytic activity and durability) of electrocatalyst.

Due to high densities of atomic steps and kinks and their abundance of unsaturated coordination sites, noble metal NCs with high-energy surfaces often exhibit superior performances compared to those with low-energy surface structures. A complete understanding of the growth mechanisms of noble-metal NCs with high-energy surface structures would enable the rational design of noble metal NCs with optimized performances for specific applications. In this review, we concentrate on the growth mechanisms of noble-metal NCs with high-energy facets by summarizing the state-of-the-art progress in the surface structure-controlled synthesis of noble metal NCs with high-energy facets. By carefully considering both the thermodynamic and kinetic factors that affect the surface structures, we intentionally classify different approaches into four categories (i.e., surface-regulating-agent assisted strategies, supersaturation controlled strategies, electrochemical methods, and template directed methods), and insights into the respective growth mechanisms are demonstrated by representative examples. Especially, we highlight the role of supersaturation in the formation of the high-energy surface, which successfully explained apparent contradictory results when only taking the “capping” effect into consideration. Then several typical examples are given to demonstrate the versatility of the high-energy facets in improving both catalytic activity and selectivity.

     "abstract": "Tumor heterogeneity is increasingly implicated in the limited therapeutic efficacy exerted by nanomedicines in vivo. Such heterogeneity is manifold – existing at macro- and microscopic scales, and subject to tumor differentiation, region, intervention, and time. Further, variable patient response to nano-based therapy has called into question the current pursuit, and practices, of nano-formulation development. Long-standing concepts in advanced drug delivery may therefore benefit from renewed examination in light of ongoing elucidations into tumor pathophysiology. Tumor microenvironmental features bear significant structural and functional constraints to effective nanomedicine delivery. Importantly, the relationship between delivery and therapeutic efficacy has proved elusive, owing to inefficient drug release from nanocarriers and/or target site access resulting from physical or physiological hindrance. Characterization of local tumor parameters as potential determinants of nanomedicine efficacy may complement conventional whole-tumor measurements. The challenges in identifying key determinants of nanomedicine efficacy and monitoring their impact in space and time are non-trivial. Newly developed image-based methodologies provide a non-invasive and quantitative means of measuring the performance of both nanomedicine (e.g., pharmacodynamic effect) and microenvironmental properties (e.g., abnormal supply and transport of nutrients/drugs), with the potential to enable appropriate treatment design. Ultimately, the personalization of anti-cancer therapies may require the characterization of underlying pathophysiological parameters, and their association with therapeutic outcomes.",

In recent years, the use of noble metal nanoparticle polymer composites for plasmonic sensing has attracted much attention. Because several fabrication methodologies for such nanocomposites have already been established, resulting in a substantial collection of plasmon-active sensing devices, it would be timely to review the progress made so far and discuss future research directions. Although the synthesis and applications of a variety of nanoparticle polymer composites have been described in general and at length in several earlier reviews, no review to date has been dedicated to noble metal nanoparticle polymer composites on solid substrates fabricated for plasmonic sensing. One of the greatest advantages of nanoparticle polymer composites on solid substrates is their convenient utilization in practical applications, as they can be readily produced on gold and silicon substrates, glass and even paper. This makes them more suitable than solution phase nanoparticle polymer composites for device integration, bringing them closer to commercialization and consumer use. To facilitate rapid technology transfers in the near future, an in-depth understanding of the subject matter as well as an update of the state-of-the-art is therefore necessary, prompting this review.

It is expected that these 2D nanosheets, in bulk or in composite materials, could maintain their extraordinary properties.

Indeed, interfacing high performance active devices with biology could impact a variety of fields, including regenerative bioelectronic medicines, smart prosthetics, medical robotics, and human–machine interfaces. Biology, from the molecular scale of DNA and proteins, to the macroscopic scale of tissues and organs, is three-dimensional, often soft and stretchable, and temperature sensitive. This renders most biological platforms incompatible with the fabrication and materials processing methods that have been developed and optimized for functional electronics, which are typically planar, rigid and brittle. A number of strategies have been developed to overcome these dichotomies. One particularly novel approach is the use of extrusion- based multi-material 3D printing, which is an additive manufacturing technology that offers a freeform fabrication strategy. This approach addresses the dichotomies presented above by (1) using 3D printing and imaging for customized, hierarchical, and interwoven device architectures; (2) employing nanotechnology as an enabling route for introducing high performance materials, with the potential for exhibiting properties not found in the bulk; and (3) 3D printing a range of soft and nanoscale materials to enable the integration of a diverse palette of high quality functional nanomaterials with biology. Further, 3D printing is a multi-scale platform, allowing for the incorporation of functional nanoscale inks, the printing of microscale features, and ultimately the creation of macroscale devices. This blending of 3D printing, novel nanomaterial properties, and ‘living’ platforms may enable next-generation bionic systems.

Establishing correlations between nanoparticle properties and their physiological response is vitally important for nanomedicine design and optimization.

Here, we systematically investigated the influence of surface charge on the pharmacokinetics, tumor accumulation, penetration, and antitumor efficacy of nanoparticles constructed from PEG-b-PLA, loaded with docetaxel, and tuned by various lipids to yield three groups of ∼100 nm nanoparticles with positive, neutral or negative charge. Our results indicate that cationic PEGylated nanoparticles, although slightly inferior in blood circulation time and tumor accumulation, outperform their anionic or neutral counterparts in inhibiting tumor growth in five different tumor models. Docetaxel-loaded cationic nanoparticles significantly suppressed tumor growth with an inhibition ratio of ∼90%, compared with the ∼60% achieved by their anionic or neutral counterparts. Further studies reveal that better tumor penetration and 2.5-fold higher cellular uptake of cationic PEGylated nanoparticles is responsible for their superior treatment efficacy.

     "abstract": "Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals which exhibit strong photoluminescence and have a variety of applications in modern nanotechnology. Specifically, QDs may serve as source of photoelectrical response to optical excitation, thus paving the way to development of novel optoelectronic and photovoltaic QD-based systems and devices. QD photoexcitation gives rise to excitons, electron–hole pairs which are bound by Coulomb forces and may dissociate in such a way that the charge carriers leave the nanoparticle and interact with the environment. The surface of inorganic QDs is always covered with organic ligands ensuring their colloidal stability during the synthesis and subsequent processing. The possibility to control the composition of the surface ligands is considered a promising way to modulate different parameters of charge formation and separation in nanoparticles, including the secondary pathways of charge transfer, rates of carrier generation, radiative or nonradiative electron–hole recombination, and some others.The rates and directions of these processes strongly affect the fundamental photophysical properties of QDs, such as luminescence quantum yield, quenching, bleaching, blinking, and photostability; they also determine the applicability of nanocrystals to specific areas of photovoltaics, photocatalysis, and bioanalysis, as well as fabrication of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and QD cellular automata (the transistorless computation paradigm).In this review we analyze recent advances in controlled charge generation, separation, and transfer in QD-based organic and inorganic systems, with a special emphasis on the role of the surface-stabilizing ligands in the transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carriers. The prospects of development of advanced QD-based photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices employing carefully selected surface ligands that improve the nanocrystal photophysical properties are analyzed in the “Summary and outlook” section.",

With direct visualization, the technological development of future innovative devices on the nanoscale becomes feasible.Although an enormous effort has been devoted to the comprehension and improvement of these materials and devices, the capability of investigating their dynamic behavior is hindered by the difficulty of simultaneously studying their evolution in space and time at the appropriate scales. The traditional characterization techniques and the steady-state theoretical models are both not adequate for describing their nonequilibrium behavior. Instead, a novel approach for visualization of matter with high temporal and spatial resolutions, together with energy and momentum selection, is indispensable to fully exploit their potential.Four-dimensional electron microscopy (4D-EM) has been developed with the capability of performing time-resolved imaging, diffraction and electron-spectroscopy. The acquired and sufficient spatial, temporal, energy and momentum resolution, provide the real-time access to the dynamic behavior of surfaces, interfaces and nanosystems.In this review, after outlining the 4D-EM approach, which enables sub-nanometer spatial resolution and temporal speed of 10 orders of magnitude faster than previously possible, we address several recent applications in materials science and biology, highlighting for each case the challenges that had to be overcome, the main scientific contributions, and future trends in the field. The highly inter- and multi-disciplinary approach presented here will pave the way for an unprecedented insight into the nonequilibrium phenomena of advanced materials, and should play a decisive role in the rational design and engineering of future applications.",

These developments can extend battery life in portable devices, and open new markets such as electric vehicles and large-scale grid energy storage. It is well known that surface reactions largely determine the performance and stability of electrochemical energy storage devices. Despite showing impressive capacities and high energy and power densities, many of the new nanostructured electrode materials suffer from limited lifetime due to severe electrode interaction with electrolytes or due to large volume changes. Hence control of the surface of the electrode material is essential for both increasing capacity and improving cyclic stability of the energy storage devices.Atomic layer deposition (ALD) which has become a pervasive synthesis method in the microelectronics industry, has recently emerged as a promising process for electrochemical energy storage. ALD boasts excellent conformality, atomic scale thickness control, and uniformity over large areas. Since ALD is based on self-limiting surface reactions, complex shapes and nanostructures can be coated with excellent uniformity, and most processes can be done below 200 °C. In this article, we review recent studies on the use of ALD coatings to improve the performance of electrochemical energy storage devices, with particular emphasis on the studies that have provided mechanistic insight into the role of ALD in improving device performance.",

This strategy allows for the creation of self-delivering supramolecular nanomedicines containing a high and fixed drug content.

     "abstract": "Being driven by non-covalent interactions, the formation of functional assemblies (or aggregates) of small molecules at nanoscale is a more common process in water than one would think. While most efforts on self-assembly in cellular environment concentrate on the assemblies of proteins (e.g., microtubules or amyloid fibers), nanoscale assemblies of small molecules are emerging functional entities that exhibit important biological function in cellular environments. This review describes the increasing efforts on the exploration of nanoscale assemblies of small molecules that largely originate from the serendipitous observations in research fields other than nanoscience and technology. Specifically, we describe that nanoscale assemblies of small molecules exhibit unique biological functions in extracellular and intracellular environment, thus inducing various cellular responses, like causing cell death or promoting cell proliferation. We first survey certain common feature of nanoscale molecular assemblies, then discuss several specific examples, such as, nanoscale assemblies of small peptides accumulated in the cells for selectively inhibiting cancer cells via promiscuous interactions with proteins, and nanoscale assemblies of a glycoconjugate for promoting the proliferation of stem cells or for suppressing immune responses. Subsequently, we emphasize the spatiotemporal control of nanoscale assemblies for controlling the cell fate, particularly illustrate a paradigm-shifting approach—enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA), that is, the integration of enzymatic reaction and self-assembly—for generating nanoscale assemblies from innocuous monomers for selectively inhibiting cancer cells. Moreover, we introduce a convenient assay for proteomic study of the proteins that interact with nanoscale assemblies of small molecules in cellular environment. Furthermore, we introduce the use of ligand–receptor interaction to catalyze the formation of nanoscale assemblies. By illustrating these experimental strategies for controlling the formation of nanoscale assemblies of small molecules and for identifying their corresponding protein targets, we aim to highlight that, though not being defined at the genetic level, nanoscale assemblies of small molecules are able to perform many critical biological functions. We envision that nanoscale assemblies of small molecules are a new frontier at the intersection of nanoscience and cell biology and biomedicine. In addition, we discuss the challenges and perspectives of relevant potential biomedical applications of nanoscale assemblies of small molecules.",

     "abstract": "The value of polymers is manifested in their vital use as building blocks in material and life sciences. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polynucleic acid, but its polymeric nature in materials and technological applications is often overlooked due to an impression that RNA is seemingly unstable. Recent findings that certain modifications can make RNA resistant to RNase degradation while retaining its authentic folding property and biological function, and the discovery of ultra-thermostable RNA motifs have adequately addressed the concerns of RNA unstability. RNA can serve as a unique polymeric material to build varieties of nanostructures including nanoparticles, polygons, arrays, bundles, membrane, and microsponges that have potential applications in biomedical and material sciences. Since 2005, more than a thousand publications on RNA nanostructures have been published in diverse fields, indicating a remarkable increase of interest in the emerging field of RNA nanotechnology. In this review, we aim to: delineate the physical and chemical properties of polymers that can be applied to RNA; introduce the unique properties of RNA as a polymer; review the current methods for the construction of RNA nanostructures; describe its applications in material, biomedical and computer sciences; and, discuss the challenges and future prospects in this field.",

These bioresponsive nanosystems present several unique features such as no need of an external device, precision control over site of response (from tumor tissue down to cellular organelle level) following accumulation in the tumor via either passive or active targeting, and spontaneous activation in the tumor site or inside the tumor cells.

Nanostructuring of photocatalysts and photoelectrodes has been proven to be a strong strategy to dramatically improve overall solar-to-fuel conversion efficiencies. Another technological barrier for the practical implementation of solar fuel production is long-term material durability, which has recently been well addressed through use of conformal coatings of protective layers onto the narrow band-gap semiconductors that are suitable for efficient solar-to-fuel conversions but photoelectrochemically unstable. These significant progresses may lead us to the practical implementation of solar fuel production. In this review, we will focus on these exciting progresses achieved using nanostructuring strategies, specifically regarding how the nanostructure influences the charge transport and separation; special attention will be paid to how a nanoscale coating (overlayer) passivates the surface states, thereby reducing the surface electron–hole recombination, and how a nanoscale coating (protective layer) prevents the photocorrosion or photopassivation of the semiconductors with optimal band gaps.

     "abstract": "Immunotherapy is a promising treatment modality for cancer as it can promote specific and durable anti-cancer responses. However, limitations to current approaches remain. Therapeutics administered as soluble injections often require high doses and frequent re-dosing, which can result in systemic toxicities. Soluble bolus-based vaccine formulations typically elicit weak cellular immune responses, limiting their use for cancer. Current methods for ex vivo T cell expansion for adoptive T cell therapies are suboptimal, and achieving high T cell persistence and sustained functionality with limited systemic toxicity following transfer remains challenging. Biomaterials can play important roles in addressing some of these limitations. For example, nanomaterials can be employed as vehicles to deliver immune modulating payloads to specific tissues, cells, and cellular compartments with minimal off-target toxicity, or to co-deliver antigen and danger signal in therapeutic vaccine formulations. Alternatively, micro- to macroscale materials can be employed as devices for controlled molecular and cellular delivery, or as engineered microenvironments for recruiting and programming immune cells in situ. Recent work has demonstrated the potential for combining cancer immunotherapy and biomaterials, and the application of biomaterials to cancer immunotherapy is likely to enable the development of effective next-generation platforms. This review discusses the application of engineered materials for the delivery of immune modulating agents to the tumor microenvironment, therapeutic cancer vaccination, and adoptive T cell therapy.",

The success of Li–S storage technology in living up to this promise calls for solutions to fundamental problems associated with the inherently low electrical conductivity of sulfur and sulfides, and the complex solution chemistry of lithiated sulfur compounds in commonly used electrolytes. These problems appear well posed for innovative solutions using nanomaterials and for fundamental answers guided by the tools of nanotechnology. Beginning with a review of the current understanding of Li–S battery chemistry and operation, this review discusses how advances in nano-characterization and theoretical studies of the Li–S system are helping advance the understanding of the Li–S battery. Factors that prevent Li–S cells from realizing the theoretical capacity set by their chemistry are discussed both in terms of the impressive advances in cell design enabled by nanomaterials and recent progress aimed at nanoengineering the cathode and other cell components.

The role of Ag+ release in the action mechanism was also indirectly observed in numerous studies, and explains the sensitivity of the antimicrobial activity to the presence of some chemical species, notably halides and sulfides which form insoluble salts with Ag+. As such, surface properties of Ag nanoparticles have a crucial impact on their potency, as they influence both physical (aggregation, affinity for bacterial membrane, etc.) and chemical (dissolution, passivation, etc.) phenomena.

     "abstract": "Scattering of light by disordered structures is a common phenomenon in our daily life. For many scientific applications, scattering is often treated as a detrimental effect. However, recent development in the field of nanophotonics shows that scattering in disordered nanostructures can enable new functionalities, including the unexpected property of random lasing. A random laser is different from a traditional laser in that the feedback amplification is not provided by a cavity formed by reflection components, but by disorder-induced scattering. Depending on the nature of disordered nanostructures, which can range from a few nanometers to several hundreds of nanometers in size, disorder-induced scattering can provide intensity feedback or amplitude feedback. Thus random lasers are classified into two categories: incoherent random lasers and coherent lasers. During the past two decades, many disordered nanostructures, including laser dye in colloidal systems, photonic crystals, polymeric matrices, rare earth doped nanopowders, quantum dots, semiconductors, and biological tissues have been proposed and demonstrated to form high-performance random lasers. Excitation mechanisms have included optical and electrical pumping. In the former, besides single photon excitation, multiphoton pumped upconversion random lasing has also been demonstrated.In this review, we describe the physics that explains the optical properties of disordered nanostructures and scattering used to develop the random lasers, particularly discussing the role of modes in random lasers. We then present the current state-of-art of fabrication and processing of various disordered nanostructures for the development of random lasers, including techniques to manipulate characteristics such as tunability and directionality. In this context, random fiber lasers will be discussed, as they play an important role in applications of random lasers. It will also be pointed out that random lasers keep the spatial and the temporal coherence characteristic behavior of conventional lasers, as well as the Poissonian statistics well above the threshold. Recent achievements in upconversion lasing, Raman lasing and SPASER lasing in a random medium will also be covered. Then we discuss the impact of random lasers in cross-disciplinary areas such as astrophysics. A major emphasis of this review is to cover the various applications that have already emerged.

As an on-going effort to increase the cycle life and energy densities of lithium-ion batteries, high-capacity alloy anodes, such as silicon, tin, and their alloys have attracted considerable attention due to their high specific capacities (4200 mAh/g for Si, 994 mAh/g for Sn) compared to state-of-the-art graphite materials (372 mAh/g). These alloy materials are made into nano-size materials to achieve their full potential in capacity and life. The high-capacity material is assembled into a polymer laminate composite for a functional lithium-ion cell. However, these alloys experience a large volume change during lithiation and delithiation, which disturbs the electrode integrity, causing its mechanical failure, including delamination from the current collector and cracking of the electrode. Unlike the traditional approach to electrode architecture, new materials and approaches have been developed to assemble nanoparticles into hierarchical structures to achieve high capacity and performance. In this hierarchical approach, polymer electrode binders are a critical component to address the large volume change induced by the high specific capacity during lithiation and delithiation.

     "abstract": "Based on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of metallic nanoparticles, plasmonic nanosensors have emerged as a powerful tool for biosensing applications. Many detection schemes have been developed and the field is rapidly growing to incorporate new methodologies and applications. Amidst all the ongoing research efforts, one common factor remains a key driving force: continued improvement of high-sensitivity detection. Although there are many excellent reviews available that describe the general progress of LSPR-based plasmonic biosensors, there has been limited attention to strategies for improving the sensitivity of plasmonic nanosensors. Recognizing the importance of this subject, this review highlights recent progress on different strategies used for improving the sensitivity of plasmonic nanosensors. These strategies are classified into the following three categories based on their different sensing mechanisms: (1) sensing based on target-induced local refractive index changes, (2) colorimetric sensing based on LSPR coupling, and (3) amplification of detection sensitivity based on nanoparticle growth. The basic principles and cutting-edge examples are provided for each kind of strategy, collectively forming a unifying framework to view the latest attempts to improve the sensitivity of nanoplasmonic sensors. Future trends for the fabrication of improved plasmonic nanosensors are also discussed.",

Here, we outlined recent efforts geared toward risk assessment for nanotechnologies and nanomaterials, and discuss the challenges associated with providing accurate risk information to policymakers and regulators.

     "abstract": "Nanoparticles have been intensely pursued for drug delivery for three decades, but their delivery efficiency remains low despite numerous innovations in nanoparticle manufacturing including materials, particle size, surface physicochemistry and targeting moieties. A major reason for this shortfall is their unintended uptake by reticuloendothelial system (RES) in the liver, spleen, lung, lymph nodes, etc., which competes with the intended targets. Here we demonstrate a temporary blockade of RES by commercial liposome to substantially delay blood clearance and increase tumor accumulation of small sized, PEGylated nanoparticles. RES-blockade dramatically enhanced therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel-containing nanoparticles against human prostate cancer: substantial tumor cell kill was detected within 48 h of administration by diffusion MRI and a remarkably longer tumor growth delay was achieved in comparison with nanoparticle treatment alone. Importantly, RES-blockade did not result in any weight loss or impairment of liver function, neither did it jeopardize RES-mediated host defense. Cellular and molecular studies have revealed blockade mechanisms, suggesting this safe and effective blockade strategy has broad utility.",

     "abstract": "Anisotropic nanoparticles are ideal building blocks for a variety of functional materials due to their unique and anisotropic optical, electronic, magnetic and mechanical properties. Precise control over the orientation and spatial arrangement of these nanomaterials is often requisite to achieve coupling between nanoparticles and thereby translate the properties of individual nanoparticles to macroscopic material properties. The physics and thermodynamics involved in the self-assembly are inherently more complex than isotropic nanoparticles due to the anisotropy within the system. However, the anisotropy also introduces anisotropic nanoparticle surface chemistry and stronger interparticle interactions which could be leveraged to achieve self-assembly. To address these challenges and opportunities, a plethora of strategies have been conceived and developed to induce the self-assembly of anisotropic nanoparticles into desired nanostructures over macroscopic areas and volumes. These strategies involve manipulation of interparticle physical interactions, modification of nanoparticle surface chemistry, application of external fields, and utilization of physically or chemically patterned templates to achieve the required level of spatial and orientational control over the assembly of anisotropic nanoparticles. The resulting ordered anisotropic nanoparticle assemblies display strong plasmonic, electronic, and excitonic coupling, which render these assemblies as ideal materials for chemical and biological sensing, energy harvesting, and many other technological applications. Considering the rapid advancement in this field of research, this review aims to provide an overview of the assembly, applications, and opportunities of anisotropic nanomaterials.",

These polyhedral supercrystals are considered as a new class of superlattice structures in which particle morphology strongly dictates the shapes of resulting supercrystals if the particles are larger than 20 nm. This review provides examples and advances in fabricating supercrystals on a substrate during the process of solvent evaporation and through diffusion transport of surfactant to generate free-standing supercrystals. The diversity of supercrystal morphologies observed is illustrated. In many cases, the supercrystal formation process has been found to be surfactant-mediated with surfactant molecules residing between adjacent nanocrystals. Polyhedral nanocrystal assembly was found to be strongly shape-guided. Thus, the formation of polyhedral supercrystals offers a unique opportunity to reconsider the forces involved from a more global perspective instead of focusing on mainly local interactions. Efforts have been made to record the entire supercrystal formation process. Finally, some results of properties of supercrystals and future directions for supercrystal research are provided.",

Many different PM have been designed and evaluated over the years, and some of them have steadily progressed through clinical trials.

Core-crosslinking is among the most popular methods to improve the in vivo stability of PM, and a number of core-crosslinked polymeric micelles (CCPM) have demonstrated promising efficacy in animal models. The latter is particularly true for CCPM in which (pro-) drugs are covalently entrapped. This ensures proper drug retention in the micelles during systemic circulation, efficient drug delivery to pathological sites via EPR, and tailorable drug release kinetics at the target site. We here summarize recent advances in the CCPM field, addressing the chemistry involved in preparing them, their in vitro and in vivo performance, potential biomedical applications, and guidelines for efficient clinical translation.",

However, graphene also suffers from a severe drawback: it is gapless, implying that a graphene based field-effect transistor is not within reach. Silicene, the silicon analog of graphene, is in many aspects very similar to graphene, but in contrast to the planar graphene lattice, the silicene lattice is slightly buckled and composed of two vertically displaced sub-lattices. By breaking the sub-lattice symmetry a band gap can be opened, which would in principle allow the realization of a silicene field-effect transistor.

The Cy3-labeled cationic micelles showed remarkable Cy3 distribution in the MCC whereas charge-shielded micelles with a poly(ethylene glycol) surface accumulated on the surface of the MCC. Penetration occurred against convectional flow caused by a hydraulic pressure gradient. The study using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) showed that the cationic micelles dissociate at the interface between the culture media and the MCC or possibly inside of the first-layer cells and penetrates into the MCC as unimers. The penetration and distribution were energy-dependent and suppressed by various endocytic inhibitors. These suggest that cationic unimers mainly utilized clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis for cellular entry and a significant fraction were exocytosed by an unknown mechanism.",

     "abstract": "Nanomedicines have the potential to significantly impact cancer therapy by improving drug efficacy and decreasing off-target effects, yet our ability to efficiently home nanoparticles to disease sites remains limited. One frequently overlooked constraint of current active targeting schemes is the relative dearth of targetable antigens within tumors, which restricts the amount of cargo that can be delivered in a tumor-specific manner. To address this limitation, we exploit tumor-specific responses to drugs to construct a cooperative targeting system where a small molecule therapeutic modulates the disease microenvironment to amplify nanoparticle recruitment in vivo. We first administer a vascular disrupting agent, ombrabulin, which selectively affects tumors and leads to locally elevated presentation of the stress-related protein, p32. This increase in p32 levels provides more binding sites for circulating p32-targeted nanoparticles, enhancing their delivery of diagnostic or therapeutic cargos to tumors. We show that this cooperative targeting system recruits over five times higher doses of nanoparticles to tumors and decreases tumor burden when compared with non-cooperative controls. These results suggest that using nanomedicine in conjunction with drugs that enhance the presentation of target antigens in the tumor environment may be an effective strategy for improving the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.",

Upon interaction with the nanoparticles, the toxins become retrained and lose their toxicity as they are precluded from interacting with cellular targets. The resulting particle/toxin complex adopts a nanoparticulate morphology that facilitates the toxins’ intracellular delivery. This sequestration approach has immense immunological implications owing to its ability in enabling structurally preserved toxins for immune processing. This technique offers opportunities in novel toxoid vaccine designs that promise more effective anti-toxin immune responses and contrasts the existing paradigm in toxoid preparation, in which toxins are antigenically altered to ensure virulence removal. The potent nanotoxoid formulations provide a viable anti-virulence measure in combating microbial infections that involve membrane-damaging toxins, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Group A streptococcal infections.",

Judicious structural manipulation of carbon to modulate its chemical, electronic, and crystalline properties is key to the rational design of many high-performance electrochemical devices. Here we focus on three types of carbon nanomaterials of recent interest in electrochemistry, namely, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, and graphene. We concentrate on how structural variations in these carbon nanomaterials impact their electrochemical activities. In this review, following a brief overview of the synthesis methods for each class of carbon nanomaterials, we discuss their electrochemical applications for sensing, electrocatalysis, and energy storage, with emphasis on general carbon structure manipulation strategies that impart specific functionalities to suit each application area. Special attention is devoted to articulating how the electronic structure of carbon influences its electrochemical activity. Through the analysis of different electrochemical devices, we find that some of the modification techniques apply to more than one application area; thus structural manipulation methods in one class of electrochemical devices may be extended to other types.",

     "abstract": "Nanotechnology has received extraordinary attention recently due to its burgeoning role in biomedical science. The materials composing the nanoparticles produce fascinating and diverse functionalities as a result of their exceptionally small size. In fact, even seemingly insignificant changes in particle size can have profound effects on these properties. Thus size control, both during synthesis and in particle suspensions, is a sine qua non for functionality. This can be accomplished by masking the particle surface with a multitude of different ligands. Not only can surface ligands constrain the growth of nucleation, they can also direct the shape of crystallization. However no single ligand can do everything. Fortunately ligands are essentially fungible and can be exchanged at various times to confer the desired properties to the particle. This can include protecting the particle from harsh aqueous conditions, such as pH extremes, maximizing optical properties for diagnostics or shielding the particle from potentially hostile conditions found in the body. Because these moieties interact ubiquitously with various biological materials, particularly proteins, there needs to be a rationalized design of surface ligands. The design of the ligand can have crucial effects on biodistribution as well as evasion of biological defenses. Ligands can even be designed to provide new functionality in response to various environmental stimuli to improve their therapeutic or diagnostic capabilities. Considering the importance of ligands then on this emerging field, this review will thoroughly consider the ligand design for the various steps of nanodevelopment, from synthesis and assembly through biomedical translation.",

The design of structurally oriented nanoparticles can circumvent the thermodynamic instability, undesired side reactions, high processing costs, and potential nano-toxicity effects associated with nanoparticle synthesis, processing, and use. A great deal of recent efforts have focused on the formation and understanding of ordered nanoparticle superstructures with a vast range of architectures; in particular, crystallographically oriented nanoparticle superstructures, or mesocrystals. Mesocrystals can be delineated by their high degree of crystallinity, porosity, and nanoparticle subunit alignment along a crystallographic register.

     "abstract": "Ultrasound technology in combination with echogenic particles is currently having a considerable effect on the modern medical field, not only as a conventional diagnostic modality but also as a methodology that administers therapeutics to various lesions. The diagnostic and therapeutic effects of ultrasound technologies on diseased sites are governed by several primary factors such as the ultrasound technique itself and the physicochemical properties of echogenic particles. Therefore, rational design and a good combination of echogenic particles with the ultrasound technique are the most decisive factors in achieving optimal diagnostic and therapeutic goals. In this respect, great research advances in design and engineering of echogenic particles to meet these diagnostic and therapeutic demands have consistently been made.Since echogenic particles exhibit quite different behaviors in response to ultrasound, the most important issue in achieving maximal therapeutic efficacy must be the establishment of technical rationales that depend on these particles’ biomedical uses, from the selection of shell materials and gas types to the manufacturing techniques used to make particles of the proper diameter. Several attempts have been made to develop highly effective theranostic echogenic particles that have the proper particle size and yet can sustain intense echo signals for long enough to circulate repeatedly through the body, a primary requirement for targeting and accumulating at a diseased site. However, a very important challenge has been the technical barrier between the most favorable in vivo nano-size for desirable biodistribution and the obtaining of a strong echo intensity.In this review paper, the present status and the critical issues for developing theranostic echogenic particles as an ultrasound contrast agent and drug delivery vehicle will be described. Firstly, conventional micro-sized echogenic particles are comprehensively introduced with their research history, diagnostic applications and intrinsic limitations. Then recent progress in developing more advanced echogenic particles for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes will be described. Most importantly, in this review paper, the design criteria for developing promising theranostic echogenic particles to satisfy recent research and clinicians’ demands will be given, with special emphasis on overcoming the conflicting and insuperable size issue of echogenic particles.",

     "abstract": "There is an urgent need to establish a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of nanomaterial (NM) interaction with living systems and the environment, in order for regulation of NMs to keep pace with their increasing industrial application. Identification of critical properties (physicochemical descriptors) that confer the ability to induce harm in biological systems is crucial, enabling both prediction of impacts from related NMs (via quantitative nanostructure–activity relationships (QNARs) and read-across approaches) and development of strategies to ensure these features are avoided or minimised in NM production in the future (“safety by design”). A number of challenges to successful implementation of such a strategy exist, including: (i) the lack of widely available systematically varied libraries of NMs to enable generation of sufficiently robust datasets for development and validation of QNARs; (ii) the fact that many physicochemical properties of pristine NMs are inter-related and thus cannot be varied systematically in isolation from others (e.g. increasing surface charge may impact on hydrophobicity, or changing the shape of a NM may introduce defects or alter the atomic configuration of the surface); and (iii) the effect of ageing, transformation and biomolecule coating of NMs under environmental or biological conditions.A novel approach to identify interlinked physicochemical properties, and on this basis identify overarching descriptors (axes or principle components) which can be used to correlate with toxicity is proposed. An example of the approach is provided, using three principle components which we suggest can be utilised to fully describe each NM, these being the intrinsic (inherent) properties of the NM, composition (which we propose as a separate parameter) and extrinsic properties (interaction with media, molecular coronas etc.).",

Various forms of NPs including liposomes, polymer particles, micelles, dendrimers, quantum dots, gold NPs and carbon nanotubes have been synthesized and tested for therapeutic applications. One of the greatest challenges that limit the success of NPs is their ability to reach the therapeutic site at necessary doses while minimizing accumulation at undesired sites. The biodistribution of NPs is determined by body's biological barriers that manifest in several distinct ways. For intravascular delivery of NPs, the barrier manifests in the form of: (i) immune clearance in the liver and spleen, (ii) permeation across the endothelium into target tissues, (iii) penetration through the tissue interstitium, (iv) endocytosis in target cells, (v) diffusion through cytoplasm and (vi) eventually entry into the nucleus, if required. Certain applications of NPs also rely on delivery through alternate routes including skin and mucosal membranes of the nose, lungs, intestine and vagina. In these cases, the diffusive resistance of these tissues poses a significant barrier to delivery. This review focuses on the current understanding of penetration of NPs through biological barriers.

Nano-crystalline materials and nano-glasses are solid materials composed of nanometer-sized crystalline or nanometer-sized glassy regions connected by crystal/crystal or glass/glass interfaces. As the atomic structures of these interfaces differ from the ones in the building blocks, the atomic and electronic structures of these interfaces differ from the ones in the building blocks. The atomic and the electronic structures (and hence the properties) of nano-crystalline materials and/or nano-glasses differ from the ones of single crystals or of glasses, respectively, that are available today with the same chemical compositions.In the second part of this review solid materials will be discussed the properties of which are controlled by nanometer spaced solid/liquid or solid/gas interfaces. The first group of materials of this kind to be discussed are nano-porous metals with electrolyte or gas filled interconnected nanometer-sized ligaments. The properties of the resulting numerous solid/liquid or solid/gas interfaces may be controlled reversibly by external variables e.g. by applying an external voltage between an aqueous electrolyte in the pores and the nano-porous metal or by varying the chemical composition of the gas in the pores. Due to the high density (∼1015 mm−3) of nano-scale ligaments, the entire nano-porous material reacts and becomes a solid of macroscopic dimensions with tunable mechanical, electric, magnetic, etc. properties. The other group of materials to be discussed in the second section of this review are nanometer-sized single crystals embedded in an aqueous electrolyte. By varying the boundary conditions for the formation of these nanometer-sized crystals, the size, the shape and the electronic structure of these nanometer-sized crystals can be switched reversibly so that switchable quantum transistors are obtained.All of these findings may also be interpreted in a more general context suggesting that in all the above mentioned cases, complex structures evolve if the following four conditions are met: (i) a substrate or nucleation site, on which the structures can organize, (ii) a free volume providing the sterical degrees of freedom for building the new structures, (iii) a reservoir of building blocks (molecules, atoms, ions, crystallites, glassy clusters) from which the structures can be (reversibly or irreversibly) formed and finally (iv) confined geometries preventing the return to thermal equilibrium by preventing the growth of macroscopic single crystals. This general approach seems to open the way for understanding and developing the guidelines for the growth of new self-organized complex material systems far from thermal equilibrium.",

     "abstract": "In recent years, the syntheses of III–V quantum dots have attracted extensive interests because of their remarkable quantum-confinement-effects, other attractive properties such as large exciton radius and potential applications in a number of areas such as gas sensing and biological probing. Some III–V members are low toxic and suitable to be used in bio-system with their excellent fluorescent characteristics. Although a solution-phase preparation of III–V quantum dots has become possible, the synthesis approach is still in its infancy and the quality of III–V products is inferior to those of II–VI and IV–VI quantum dots due to some difficulties such as lack of suitable precursors, high covalent characteristic, and difficult control of their nucleation and growth. The size, size distribution and crystallinity are strongly dependent on a specific reaction procedure and preparation technique. It is also believed that the selection of suitable precursors and designing corresponding key reactions should hold the keys for a successful production of the desired III–V quantum dots. This article focuses on the solution-phase synthesis of In- and Ga-based III–V quantum dots, and these developments are presented through a classification of their chemical routes including metathesis, thermolysis, dehalosilylation and transmetalation with a discussion on their preparation techniques such as one-pot heating-up and hot-injection. Furthermore, III–V quantum dots acted in gas sensing and bio-imaging applications are outlined as well. Eventually, an outlook of current challenges and promising direction for the development of III–V quantum dot synthesis is provided.",

     "abstract": "The paper reviews physical concepts related to the collective dynamics of plasmon excitations in metal nanocrystals with a focus on the photogeneration of energetic carriers. Using quantum linear response theory, we analyze the wave function of a plasmon in nanostructures of different sizes. Energetic carriers are efficiently generated in small nanocrystals due to the non-conservation of momentum of electrons in a confined nanoscale system. On the other hand, large nanocrystals and nanostructures, when driven by light, produce a relatively small number of carriers with large excitation energies. Another important factor is the polarization of the exciting light. Most efficient generation and injection of high-energy carriers can be realized when the optically induced electric current is along the smallest dimension of a nanostructure and also normal to its walls and, for efficient injection, the current should be normal to the collecting barrier. Other important properties and limitations: (1) intra-band transitions are preferable for generation of energetic electrons and dominate the absorption for relatively long wavelengths (approximately >600 nm), (2) inter-band transitions efficiently generate energetic holes and (3) the carrier-generation and absorption spectra can be significantly different. The described physical properties of metal nanocrystals are essential for a variety of potential applications utilizing hot plasmonic electrons including optoelectronic signal processing, photodetection, photocatalysis and solar-energy harvesting.",

     "abstract": "The ability of enzymes to catalyze reactions and engage in complex syntheses has long made them attractive for use in a multitude of industrial, biotechnological, and research applications. Although this utility grows with each passing year, the exploitation of enzymes in ex vivo formats is still hampered by relatively low rates of turnover, particularly when attached to planar surfaces. However, a growing number of reports suggest that assembling enzymes or their substrates onto nanoparticle (NP) surfaces can accelerate or otherwise improve catalysis when compared to freely diffusing enzyme in bulk solution. Here, we present an in-depth review and discussion of what is currently known about this phenomenon with an emphasis on inorganic NPs. The assembly of enzyme–NP and substrate–NP bioconjugates is first described, emphasizing their heterogeneity and the expected impact on enzymatic activity within the framework of collision theory, biomolecular interactions, and the classic Michaelis–Menten model. We next discuss representative examples from the literature where accelerated enzyme activity has been reported in conjunction with NP materials, the mechanisms that have been proposed to account for the accelerated activity, and the challenges that remain to fully understand and optimize this potentially valuable phenomenon. Finally, approaches to quantitative modeling of NP-associated enzyme activity are discussed, including a kinetic analysis that we suggest can provide insight into the underlying mechanisms that may drive the observed rate enhancements. We conclude with a perspective on the future evolution and broader impact of this growing area of nanoresearch.",

While paying attention to the equipment of the nanodevice for the transport and molecular recognition for the delivery, they have to face the challenges posed by the messy environment of the body.

     "abstract": "Targeted nanoparticles are increasingly being engineered for the treatment of cancer. By design, they can passively accumulate in tumors, selectively bind to targets in their environment, and deliver localized treatments. However, the penetration of targeted nanoparticles deep into tissue can be hindered by their slow diffusion and a high binding affinity. As a result, they often localize to areas around the vessels from which they extravasate, never reaching the deep-seeded tumor cells, thereby limiting their efficacy. To increase tissue penetration and cellular accumulation, we propose generalizable guidelines for nanoparticle design and validate them using two different computer models that capture the potency, motion, binding kinetics, and cellular internalization of targeted nanoparticles in a section of tumor tissue. One strategy that emerged from the models was delaying nanoparticle binding until after the nanoparticles have had time to diffuse deep into the tissue. Results show that nanoparticles that are designed according to these guidelines do not require fine-tuning of their kinetics or size and can be administered in lower doses than classical targeted nanoparticles for a desired tissue penetration in a large variety of tumor scenarios. In the future, similar models could serve as a testbed to explore engineered tissue-distributions that arise when large numbers of nanoparticles interact in a tumor environment.",

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), in particular, have proven to be indispensable for clean and efficient energy conversion as well as storage in fuel cells. MOFs offer several advantages as electrocatalysts, electrolyte membranes, and fuel storage materials – they possess remarkable design flexibility, ultra-large surface-to-volume ratios, and they allow functionalization with multivalent ligands and metal centers to increase avidity for fuel cells. Considerable efforts have been made to utilize the unique properties of MOFs as energy materials in developing high performance fuel cells.

     "abstract": "In view of the worldwide energy challenge in the 21st century, the technology of semiconductor-based photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has received considerable attention as an alternative approach for solar energy harvesting and storage. The performance of advanced PEC devices is fundamentally related to the semiconductor photoelectrode design at the nanoscale. Among various architectures, two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets with thickness generally below 100 nm hold great promise for highly efficient PEC water splitting. Hence, this article mainly provides a comprehensive review of current research efforts that focus on the scientific and technological possibilities of using 2D nanosheets to fabricate efficient photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting, followed by a concise overview of the state-of-the-art progress of 2D nanosheets, where we also present a discussion of how to overcome the challenges that have prevented realizing the full potential of 2D nanosheets. Particular attention is paid on two major approaches. One is to align nanosheets directly on the substrate to maximize the morphological advantages of 2D nanosheets. The other is to further reduce the thickness of common 2D nanosheets to single or a few atomic layers aiming at regulating the intrinsic physical and chemical properties for PEC water splitting. Both of the approaches have led to excellent improvements on PEC performance and greatly broaden the knowledge about where and how the existing semiconductor materials can be used in solar energy-related applications. It is hence envisioned that 2D nanosheets can offer wide opportunities and perspectives on the directions toward high-efficiency solar energy conversion.",

Piezotronics is about the devices fabricated using the piezopotential as a “gate” voltage to tune/control charge carrier transport at a contact or junction. The piezo-phototronic effect is to use the piezopotential to control the carrier generation, transport, separation and/or recombination for improving the performance of optoelectronic devices, such as solar cell and LED. Starting from the fundamental physics principles, this article gives an updated review about the fabrication of array of piezotronic devices so that they can be integrated into a system for achieving specific functions as sensors and MEMS.

Compared with the traditionally used biological labels such as organic dyes and quantum dots (QDs), upconversion nanomaterials have many advantages, including higher chemical stability, lower toxicity, and higher signal-to-noise ratio. However, the low upconversion efficiency of the lanthanide UCNPs is still the most serious limitation for their applications. Improvements are still needed to optimize upconversion optical properties for further applications. In this review, we summarize the recent progresses for the enhancement of upconversion efficiency of UCNPs and discuss the challenges and opportunities to realize the highly efficient upconversion nanomaterials by systematic comparison of the advantages and shortcomings between UCNPs and QDs & organic dyes from various aspects, such as the luminescence mechanism, multicolor emission, luminescent stability, efficiency, ultra-small nanocrystals fabrication and so on.

     "abstract": "One of the most difficult problems facing the integrated circuit industry is that conventional top-down strategies, which have been the methods of choice for decades, have almost reached their limit. With the industry quest for smaller electronic devices of higher functional complexity based on nano-technologies, which are faster, more portable and less energy-consuming, intensive efforts for solutions based on bottom-up strategies are currently invested. A major difficulty that challenges the creation of functional high-performance devices based on bottom-up grown nanostructures is the accurate deterministic positioning of the individual nanostructures into large perfectly aligned arrays, in a similar manner to top-down strategies. Two main approaches are chosen to solve these issues, involving post-growth assembly-based methods or grow-in-place assembly-free methods. This review provides an overview of the most recent developments in this field, with present perspective concerning their applicability as industrial processes, concentrating on the assembly of one-dimensional nanowires and nanotubes structures. Another route is devised that combines top-down and bottom-up strategies for the on-place NWs growth in a single step, exploiting the strengths of both approaches. Although major advance is shown in the field, it is concluded that current methods are still lacking on their way to become high throughput, industrial-scale manufacturable, and potentially can be covered by a hybrid approach, integrating top-down techniques with grow-in-place assembly-free growth methods.",

We describe the modulation of nanorod growth through the addition of an enzymatically-produced thiolated molecule. The enzyme acetylcholinesterase was selected because it hydrolyzes the substrate acetylthiocholine to produce the thiol-containing molecule thiocholine, in a controlled manner. UV–vis spectroscopic monitoring showed that the resulting localized surface plasmon resonance bands of the formed colloidal nanoparticles are highly sensitive to the concentration of thiocholine, while transmission electron microscopy allowed us to confirm that the observed optical changes arise from the evolution of the shape of the obtained gold nanoparticles from nanorods to cubes and finally to spheres, upon increasing the concentration of thiocholine. Hence, enzyme concentrations could be correlated with different plasmon bands and/or gold nanoparticle shapes. On the basis of this result, a simple colorimetric assay is proposed for the detection of subnanomolar concentrations of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which are close analogs of nerve gases.",

The integration of TFTs on flexible substrates is of considerable interest for diverse applications including electronic displays and radio frequency identification, and can enable a new generation of flexible, wearable and disposable electronics.

The organic semiconductors can be processed in solution and applied onto plastic substrate at room temperature, but are typically limited by rather poor electronic performance.

     "abstract": "Semiconductor nanowires configured as the active channels of field-effect transistors (FETs) have been used as detectors for high-resolution electrical recording from single live cells, cell networks, tissues and organs. Extracellular measurements with substrate supported silicon nanowire (SiNW) FETs, which have projected active areas orders of magnitude smaller than conventional microfabricated multielectrode arrays (MEAs) and planar FETs, recorded action potential and field potential signals with high signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution from cultured neurons, cultured cardiomyocytes, acute brain slices and whole animal hearts. Measurements made with modulation-doped nanoscale active channel SiNW FETs demonstrate that signals recorded from cardiomyocytes are highly localized and have improved time resolution compared to larger planar detectors. In addition, several novel three-dimensional (3D) transistor probes, which were realized using advanced nanowire synthesis methods, have been implemented for intracellular recording. These novel probes include (i) flexible 3D kinked nanowire FETs, (ii) branched intracellular nanotube SiNW FETs, and (iii) active silicon nanotube FETs. Following phospholipid modification of the probes to mimic the cell membrane, the kinked nanowire, branched intracellular nanotube and active silicon nanotube FET probes recorded full-amplitude intracellular action potentials from spontaneously firing cardiomyocytes. Moreover, these probes demonstrated the capability of reversible, stable, and long-term intracellular recording, thus indicating the minimal invasiveness of the new nanoscale structures and suggesting biomimetic internalization via the phospholipid modification. Simultaneous, multi-site intracellular recording from both single cells and cell networks were also readily achieved by interfacing independently addressable nanoprobe devices with cells. Finally, electronic and biological systems have been seamlessly merged in 3D for the first time using macroporous nanoelectronic scaffolds that are analogous to synthetic tissue scaffold and the extracellular matrix in tissue. Free-standing 3D nanoelectronic scaffolds were cultured with neurons, cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells to yield electronically-innervated synthetic or ‘cyborg’ tissues. Measurements demonstrate that innervated tissues exhibit similar cell viability as with conventional tissue scaffolds, and importantly, demonstrate that the real-time response to drugs and pH changes can be mapped in 3D through the tissues. These results open up a new field of research, wherein nanoelectronics are merged with biological systems in 3D thereby providing broad opportunities, ranging from a nanoelectronic/tissue platform for real-time pharmacological screening in 3D to implantable ‘cyborg’ tissues enabling closed-loop monitoring and treatment of diseases. Furthermore, the capability of high density scale-up of the above extra- and intracellular nanoscopic probes for action potential recording provide important tools for large-scale high spatio-temporal resolution electrical neural activity mapping in both 2D and 3D, which promises to have a profound impact on many research areas, including the mapping of activity within the brain.",

     "abstract": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) originate from the primary tumor mass and enter into the peripheral bloodstream. CTCs hold the key to understanding the biology of metastasis and also play a vital role in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, disease monitoring, and personalized therapy. However, CTCs are rare in blood and hard to isolate. Additionally, the viability of CTCs can easily be compromised under high shear stress while releasing them from a surface. The heterogeneity of CTCs in biomarker expression makes their isolation quite challenging; the isolation efficiency and specificity of current approaches need to be improved. Nanostructured substrates have emerged as a promising biosensing platform since they provide better isolation sensitivity at the cost of specificity for CTC isolation. This review discusses major challenges faced by CTC isolation techniques and focuses on nanostructured substrates as a platform for CTC isolation.",

This article reviews the interfacial morphologies and electronic structures between organic molecules and graphene, prepared on different substrates.

     "abstract": "The metal–support interaction (MSI) plays an essential role in the catalysis by gold. We summarized the support effect on the catalysis by gold in this review. According to the reducibility of the oxide supports, we divide the supports into two categories: reducible metal-oxide (RMO) and irreducible oxide (IRO) supports. The catalytic mechanisms for low-temperature CO oxidation over RMO supported gold catalysts are discussed based on the recent progress on this topic and the key role of gold–support interface in the catalytic reactions is highlighted. To prolong the perimeters of the gold–support interfaces, one can both decrease the sizes of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and tune the morphology of the support (e.g., shape, size, etc.). From the point of view of decreasing the size of both gold and the support simultaneously for maximizing the boundary of gold and the support, we classify the gold-based bimetallic catalysts into metal supported gold and inversely metal/RMO supported gold. The nanoporous gold (NPG) synthesized by dealloying bulk Au–Ag alloy can also be considered as an inversely Ag/AgOx supported gold catalyst. Thus, the traditional concept of support can be extended greatly. Finally, the strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) in the Au-based and Pt-based system has been compared to show the distinctive feature of gold catalysts.",

One of the fundamental issues concerning nanoparticles upon processing and utilization is overcoming the problem of aggregation. Special methods are therefore required to keep them as individual, isolated objects. Especially for inorganic particles, we demonstrate practical methods herein for nanoparticle functionalization, stabilization, and transfer between media of different polarities. The homogeneous incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles into matrix polymers to yield nanocomposites is a primary concern. In all cases, amphiphiles appear to play a decisive role in avoiding aggregation. We therefore compare block copolymers, statistical copolymers and low molecular weight surfactants to derive practical guidelines regarding the efficient stabilization of nanoparticles.

The newly designed barcodes exhibited enhanced stability and a two-order improvement in analytical sensitivity compared with barcodes without any metal coating. This sensitivity enabled the barcodes to be used for multiplexed biosensing, for example, to differentiate the deadly malaria pathogen strain Plasmodium falciparum from the less lethal Plasmodium vivax specie in a single vial.

     "abstract": "Nanoparticles are under active investigation for the detection and treatment of cancer. Yet our understanding of nanoparticle delivery to tumors is limited by our ability to observe the uptake process on its own scale in living subjects. We chose to study single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) because they exhibit among the highest levels of tumor uptake across the wide variety of available nanoparticles. We target them using RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) peptide which directs them to integrins overexpressed on tumor vasculature and on the surface of some tumor cells (e.g., U87MG as used here). We employ intravital microscopy (IVM) to quantitatively examine the spatiotemporal framework of targeted SWNT uptake in a murine tumor model. IVM provided a dynamic microscale window into nanoparticle circulation, binding to tumor blood vessels, extravasation, binding to tumor cells, and tumor retention. RGD-SWNTs bound to tumor vasculature significantly more than controls (P < 0.0001). RGD-SWNTs extravasated similarly compared to control RAD-SWNTs, but post-extravasation we observed as RGD-SWNTs eventually bound to individual tumor cells significantly more than RAD-SWNTs (P < 0.0001) over time. RGD-SWNTs and RAD-SWNTs displayed similar signal in tumor for a week, but over time their curves significantly diverged (P < 0.001) showing increasing RGD-SWNTs relative to untargeted SWNTs. We uncovered the complex spatiotemporal interplay between these competing uptake mechanisms. Specific uptake was delimited to early (1–6 h) and late (1–4 weeks) time-points, while non-specific uptake dominated from 6 h to 1 week. Our analysis revealed critical, quantitative insights into the dynamic, multifaceted mechanisms implicated in ligand-targeted SWNT accumulation in tumor using real-time microscopic observation.",

The basis for enhancement in these hybrid nanostructures resides in four general structures in which conjugated polymers act as conduits that interface and respond to nanoparticle interactions or conversely play the role of the sensitizing agent to enhance sensitivity, lower detection limit, response time or selectivity of relatively inert substances, ultimately giving rise to high performance sensors. This review is focused on chemiresistive hybrid conducting polymer sensors for detection of gaseous chemicals discussing several recent reports along with strategies for further development of hybrid sensors.",

     "abstract": "Sensitivity and specificity are two most important factors to take into account for molecule sensing, chemical detection and disease diagnosis. A perfect sensitivity is to reach the level where a single molecule can be detected. An ideal specificity is to reach the level where the substance can be detected in the presence of many contaminants. The rapidly progressing nanopore technology is approaching this threshold. A wide assortment of biomotors and cellular pores in living organisms perform diverse biological functions. The elegant design of these transportation machineries has inspired the development of single molecule detection based on modulations of the individual current blockage events. The dynamic growth of nanotechnology and nanobiotechnology has stimulated rapid advances in the study of nanopore based instrumentation over the last decade, and inspired great interest in sensing of single molecules including ions, nucleotides, enantiomers, drugs, and polymers such as PEG, RNA, DNA, and polypeptides. This sensing technology has been extended to medical diagnostics and third generation high throughput DNA sequencing. This review covers current nanopore detection platforms including both biological pores and solid state counterparts. Several biological nanopores have been studied over the years, but this review will focus on the three best characterized systems including α-hemolysin and MspA, both containing a smaller channel for the detection of single stranded DNA, as well as bacteriophage phi29 DNA packaging motor connector that contains a larger channel for the passing of double stranded DNA. The advantage and disadvantage of each system are compared; their current and potential applications in nanomedicine, biotechnology, and nanotechnology are discussed.",

     "abstract": "Tailored materials with tunable properties are crucial for applications as biomaterials, for drug delivery, as functional coatings, or as lightweight composites. An emerging paradigm in designing such materials is the construction of hierarchical assemblies of simple building blocks into complex architectures with superior properties. We review this approach in a case study of silk, a genetically programmable and processable biomaterial, which, in its natural role serves as a versatile protein fiber with hierarchical organization to provide structural support, prey procurement or protection of eggs. Through an abstraction of knowledge from the physical system, silk, to a mathematical model using category theory, we describe how the mechanism of spinning fibers from proteins can be translated into music through a process that assigns a set of rules that governs the construction of the system. This technique allows one to express the structure, mechanisms and properties of the ‘material’ in a very different domain, ‘music’. The integration of science and art through categorization of structure–property relationships presents a novel paradigm to create new bioinspired materials, through the translation of structures and mechanisms from distinct hierarchical systems and in the context of the limited number of building blocks that universally governs these systems.",

In this review, we present an overview of recent advances in beetle-inspired, artificial dry and wet adhesives in the context of nanofabrication and material properties. For convenience, the beetle's adhesions from wing to tiptoe are classified into four types: hair interlocking, mushroom-shaped pads, oil-assisted spatula-shaped pads, and claws. After introducing the structural features and functions of these systems, we describe how the current nanofabrication methods can be applied to mimic or exploit the systems. Furthermore, relevant beetle-inspired structural materials, devices (fastener, medical tape, electric connector, etc.) and microrobots are briefly overviewed, which would shed light on future smart, directional and reversible adhesion systems.",

In the past years, near-field nanoscopy – using near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) – has enabled key breakthroughs in this fast moving area. These two highly-sensitive surface scanning probe techniques go far beyond nano-imaging, by enabling researchers to localize and manipulate individual molecules on cell surfaces with nanoscale spatial resolution. Specifically, nanophotonic approaches and dynamic measurements in ultra-confined volumes allow nowadays the visualization of dynamic processes on cell membranes with optical spatial resolution down to 30 nm and sub-millisecond time resolution. These NSOM approaches are now exploited to reveal the existence of pre-assembled nanoplatforms of multi-molecular components on mammalian cells, to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the well-defined architecture of the cell surface and to decipher the molecular bases of diverse cellular processes, ranging from cell adhesion to pathogen recognition. In parallel, remarkable progress in AFM techniques now provides new opportunities for localizing single molecules in living cells and for analyzing their adhesive and mechanical properties in relation to function. Notably, the ability to observe and force-probe the cell surface machinery at molecular resolution has lead to the discovery of functional protein nanocomplexes that form under mechanical stress to activate cell signaling and cell adhesion.",

     "abstract": "Successful therapeutic modalities against breast cancer (BC) are highly dependent on the accurate prognosis and quantitative simultaneous classification of BC subtypes. Current methods based on semi-quantitative analysis or subjective interpretations are not efficient for BC prognosis and classification considering tumor heterogeneity. In this work, simultaneous monitoring and quantitative estimation of four targeted receptors (EGFR1, HER2, ER and PR) was carried out using quantum dot (QD) based hypermulticolor high-content single cell imaging cytometry. Four different QD-antibody conjugates (QD525-EGFR1, QD565-HER2, QD605-ER, and QD655-PR) were used as QD immunoassay probes for the subtype classification of biopsied samples from BC patients. The molecular profiling obtained by QD imaging cytometry was in line with that of conventional immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis with regard to the expression profiles of known predominant target receptors in in vitro model. Multi-target-single cell imaging cytometry facilitated the quantitative classification of BC subtypes with deeper insights into the existence of heterogeneity and homogeneity in BC cell lines (MCF-7, SK-BR-3, JIMT-1, and HCC-70) and primary cells from biopsied tissues. Quantitative estimates showed 36.96%, 41.45%, 23.14%, 57.45% and 63.21% heterogeneity in MCF-7, SK-BR-3, JIMT-1, HCC-70 and MCF-10A cell lines, respectively, in addition to the remarkable heterogeneity of primary cells. In consideration of BC tumor heterogeneity, highly sensitive QD immunohistochemistry was executed on different regions of BC tumors. Significant heterogeneous subtypes that have to be considered for proper drug treatment were determined depending on the tumor regions of BC patients. Herein, we presented a quantitative hypermulticolor high-content QD single cell imaging cytometry as a new model for BC prognosis and classification based on accurate quantification of tumor heterogeneity.",

The field of RNA nanotechnology is emerging.

Herein, we report the construction of thermodynamically stable X-shaped RNA nanoparticles to carry four therapeutic RNA motifs by self-assembly of reengineered small RNA fragments. We proved that each arm of the four helices in the X-motif can harbor one siRNA, ribozyme, or aptamer without affecting the folding of the central pRNA-X core, and each daughter RNA molecule within the nanoparticle folds into their respective authentic structures and retains their biological and structural function independently. Gene silencing effects were progressively enhanced as the number of the siRNA in each pRNA-X nanoparticles gradually increased from one to two, three, and four. More importantly, systemic injection of ligand-containing nanoparticles into the tail-vein of mice revealed that the RNA nanoparticles remained intact and strongly bound to cancers without entering the liver, lung or any other organs or tissues, while remaining in cancer tissue for more than 8 h.",

     "abstract": "There are two main mechanisms by which cells become multidrug resistant (MDR): by increasing drug efflux pumps on the cell membrane and by increasing anti-apoptotic pathways. The use of nanotechnology to develop nanodelivery systems has allowed researchers to overcome limitations of antineoplastic drugs by increasing the solubility of the drug and decreasing the toxicity to healthy tissues. By encapsulating drugs into nanoparticles that bypass the efflux pumps, drug efflux is reduced, hence increasing the intracellular concentration of the drug. siRNA has the ability to disrupt cellular pathways by knocking down genes, opening the door to down regulating anti-apoptotic pathways.The use of nanocarriers to deliver siRNA, prevents both renal clearance and RNase degradation by protecting siRNA chains, increasing their half life in blood. It has been suggested that co-delivering drugs and siRNA together in the same delivery system would be more effective in overcoming resistance of cancer cells than co-treatment of cancer cells with delivery systems carrying either siRNA or drugs. In this study we discuss the progress of nanoscale co-delivery systems in overcoming multidrug cancer resistance.",

This general strategy is exemplified in various lithium-free iron compounds. Reversible lithium ion extraction and reinsertion take place for Fe2+F2, Fe2+SO4, and Fe22+P2O7, when blended with LiF in nanoscale, in which a simultaneous valence change of Fe2+/3+ occurs above 3 V. FeF2–LiF could deliver 190 mAh g−1 (∼3.53 V) at 50 mA g−1 which is even higher energy density than that crystalline LiFePO4 can offer.

Thiolated Pluronic was immobilized on the gold surface to take advantage of its sol–gel transition to enhance the entrapment of doxorubicin on the nanorods. The ratio of doxorubicin to folate can be precisely controlled by varying the length of their respective segments. Doxorubicin-incorporated nanorods showed reversible release-association behavior of doxorubicin according to temperature change, and the degree of thermo-responsiveness was dependent on the length of the gold segments. A549 cells incubated with the doxorubicin nanorods at 4 °C for 2 h showed increased localization of doxorubicin in the cytoplasm compared to non-treated groups; higher potency was also observed compared to doxorubicin-treated or non-treated groups.

In this paper, we first take a critical review of heat conduction mechanisms proposed in literature, and then summarize our work. Our experimental studies demonstrate that nanoparticle clustering is the key contributor to the thermal conductivity enhancement. Guided by this insight, we use graphite flakes as additives and develop a method to prepare stable graphite suspensions with large thermal conductivity enhancement in water and oil.

The anisotropic spatial heterogeneity was introduced by a line-of-sight deposition of a thin SiO2 layer onto a carbon-fiber paper. The deposited SiO2 was later converted into SiC by a magnesiothermic reaction. The SiO2 and SiC decorated 3D current collectors were confirmed dendrite-free by ex situ SEM observation after a deep lithium deposition of 28.8 C cm−2 at a high current density of 4 mA cm−2. A high lithium cycling efficiency of 94% was achieved over deep deposition (14.4 C cm−2) and stripping cycles in a carbonate based organic electrolyte, demonstrating the superiority of the novel current collector for dendrite control and lithium cycling.

These simple systematic controls can be used to program the fibers to bundle together, twist around each other into chiral swirls, and assemble into patterned arrays of complex hierarchical architectures. The delicate balance between fiber elasticity and surface adhesion plays a critical role in determining the shape, chirality, and higher order of the assembled structures, as does the dynamic evolution of the geometric, mechanical, and surface parameters throughout the assembly process. Hierarchical assembly can also be programmed to run backwards, enabling a wide range of reversible, responsive behaviors to be encoded through rationally chosen surface chemistry. These strategies provide a foundation for designing a vast assortment of functional surfaces with anti-fouling, adhesive, optical, water and ice repellent, memory storage, microfluidic, capture and release, and many more capabilities with the structural and dynamic sophistication of their biological counterparts.",

Considerations of polymer composition, drug encapsulation, and environmental conditions influence polymeric micelle stability.

By providing a well-defined mesoporous nanostructure, we established an efficient and controllable energy transfer mechanism via the facile modification of a two-photon antenna molecule and photosensitizer on different topological domains in the MSN. The cytotoxicity induced by the singlet oxygen, generated following relay of energy transfer, was demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo breast cancer models.

Mechanisms of cytotoxicity are discussed and the problem of extrapolating knowledge gained from cell-based studies into a human scenario is highlighted. The so-called ‘proof-of-principle’ approach, whereby ultra-high NP concentrations are used to ensure cytotoxicity, is evaluated on the basis of two considerations; firstly, from a scientific perspective, the concentrations used are in no way related to the actual doses required which, in many instances, discourages further vital investigations. Secondly, these inaccurate results cast doubt on the science of nanomedicine and thus, quite dangerously, encourage unnecessary alarm in the public. In this context, the discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo results are described along with the need for a unifying protocol for reliable and realistic toxicity reports.",

However, recent progress in materials science has allowed the design and fabrication of physically and chemically functionalized materials platforms that can specifically target DCs in the body. These materials, through their in vivo modulation of DCs, have tremendous potentials as new cancer therapies. Nanoparticles, which are several orders of magnitude smaller than DCs, can efficiently deliver antigen and danger signals to these cells through passive or active targeting. Three-dimensional biomaterials, with sizes several orders of magnitude larger than DCs, create microenvironments that allow the effective recruitment and programming of these cells, and can be used as local depots of nanoparticles targeting resident DCs.

In this pursuit, the potential application of these devices to characterize additional properties such as the size, shape, charge, and concentration of nanoscaled materials (10–900 nm) has been largely overlooked.

     "abstract": "It is popular stance that successful growth – be it structural, economic or biological – requires a stable foundation. The hierarchical structure of native biological materials and tissues introduces variations in form and function across a multitude of scales. Yet, many synthetic scaffolds and substrates in which such materials are assembled, the foundation, are designed at a single scale. The result is an uncertain or shaky foundation for material assembly and tissue growth, where changes in the scaffold properties and architecture result in unpredictable behaviors in tissue development, and proven, reliable scaffolds for one tissue type may be completely unsuitable for another. This is in contrast to the behavior of foundations for civil engineering structures, which provide a decoupling of the foundation from the building design since different foundations can support equivalent functional structures. Current advancements in the design of biologically active foundations shed light on proven scaffolds and substrates, but cannot be used to design and predict success from the bottom-up. This is because while the phenomenological coupling between materials and substrates has been well investigated and has yielded methodologies for biomaterial synthesis, the underlying mechanisms of self-assembly and growth are not fully understood. A potential solution lies in the utilization of hierarchical material foundations, with molecular, fibrillar and other interactions designed across all length- and time-scales with engineered, predictive, and repeatable outcomes. The potential to realize such hierarchical multiscale scaffolds can be found in the exploitation of responsive, or mutable, polymer systems that exhibit precise control and variegated chemical functionalities for applications in diverse areas such as regenerative medicine, cancer treatment or drug delivery.",

     "abstract": "Research on Janus nanoparticles has been thriving over the past few years, focusing both on novel preparation strategies and on investigations of their unique properties. In this paper we review the main contributions to this field reported in the literature, dividing Janus nanoparticles into three main categories, depending on the route followed for their preparation. The first group of Janus nanoparticles is those obtained via self-assembly, of, e.g., block copolymers, and mixtures of ligands that in some cases show competitive adsorption on the surfaces of the nanoparticles. The second group comprises Janus nanoparticles obtained through a masking step, in which particles are trapped at the interface between two phases, so that a modification to the particle surface is made only on one side. Preparation of the third group of Janus nanoparticles relies on the phase separation of two different substances, usually either two polymers, or a polymer and an inorganic material. The peculiar properties of Janus nanoparticles, derived from their asymmetric structure, allow for their controlled self-assembly and surface activity. As a result of the simultaneous presence of two different regions in Janus nanoparticles, which can be designed to have different hydrophobicity and thereby mimic the behavior of surfactants, they can form stable clusters with defined size, and substantially reduce the interfacial tension between two different phases. Additionally, Janus nanoparticles can bring together different materials in a segregated manner at the nanoscale, thus combining widely different properties in single entity, as in the case of heterodimers.",

Also the optical reflectance, though it shows plasmon resonances at very similar wave lengths, is much lower for the corrugated NR arrays. The activity of the NR arrays as substrates for molecular detection using Raman scattering, and Rhodamine 6G (R6G) as model dye, also strongly depends on their morphology. R6G concentrations down to 1 pM are detected on the corrugated arrays yielding an effective enhancement factor (EF) of approximately 1 × 109.

Improvements in transfection efficiency have been noted for complexes delivered with a substrate-mediated approach, but the reasons behind such enhancements remain unclear. The phenotypic changes exhibited by cells interacting with nano- and micro-featured substrates offer hints that may explain these effects.

     "abstract": "The further development of the catalytic system will require advanced materials that can selectively catalyze the specific chemical reactions with a high reactivity and be recycled through the simple separation and regeneration process. The superparamagnetic nanoparticles, whose flocculation and dispersion can be reversibly controlled by applying a magnetic field, was recently employed in the catalytic applications and received the immense attractions as a new type of the recyclable support matrix. In the absence of the external magnetic field, superparamagnetic nanoparticles can be well dispersed in a reaction solution, providing large surface area which can be readily accessed by substrate molecules. And, after completing the reactions, they can be efficiently isolated from the product solution through simple magnetic separation process. In this review, we discuss the catalytic system devised by employing superparamagnetic nanoparticles as a support and their performance in catalyzing various organic reactions.",

The interaction behavior is strongly dependent on the electronic structures of organic molecules. Here we review our recent work on the three types of interactions between Au nanocrystals and organic molecules. The first is the interaction between plasmons and molecules without absorption, which leads to refractive index change-based plasmonic sensing. The refractive index-induced plasmon resonance shifts are found to be strongly dependent on the plasmonic properties of Au nanocrystals. The second is the plasmonic–molecular resonance coupling, where molecules exhibit strong light absorption around the plasmon resonance energies. The strong resonance coupling gives hybridized states and anti-crossing behaviors. The third occurs when molecules possess both absorption and fluorescence emission around the plasmon energies. The fluorescence intensities of fluorophores can be enhanced remarkably in the presence of Au nanocrystals.",

Ideal biomaterials for regeneration and repair of hard tissues must be biocompatible, possess micro and macroporosity for vascular invasion, provide surface chemistry and texture that facilitate cell attachment, proliferation, differentiation of lineage specific progenitor cells, and induce deposition of calcium phosphate mineral. To expect in vivo like cellular response several investigators have used extracellular matrix proteins as templates to recreate in vivo microenvironment for the regeneration of hard tissues. Several novel methods of designing tissue repair and restoration materials using bioinspired strategies are currently being formulated. Nanoscale structured materials can be fabricated via the spontaneous organization of self-assembling proteins to construct hierarchically organized nanomaterials. The advantage of such a method is that polypeptides can be specifically designed as building blocks incorporated with molecular recognition features and spatially distributed bioactive ligands that would provide a physiological environment for cells in vitro and in vivo. This is a rapidly evolving area and provides a promising platform for future development of nanostructured templates for hard tissue engineering. In this review we try to highlight the importance of proteins as templates for regeneration and repair of hard tissues as well as the potential of peptide based nanomaterials for regenerative therapies.",

The excellent biocompatibility, complexation capacity, and chemical-sensitivity of cyclodextrin make cyclodextrin-containing polymers attractive to construct host–guest nano-assemblies.

Various overpotentials play a crucial role in determining the shapes, structures as well as growth modes of the final product. The growth mechanism of polyhedral structures of Ag2O meso-superstructures is explained by the oriented attachment from the nature of crystallographic surfaces and the external electric induced ordering alignment process of primary nanoparticle building blocks. Thus, the current strategy not only provides the direct evidence of an external electric field driving in situ mesoassembling process, but also may be extended to other systems to synthesize the meso-superstructures.",

Methods used for the formation of hollow Cu2O nanocubes, octahedra, and truncated rhombic dodecahedra are also presented. Morphology of Cu2O nanocrystals can be expanded with the use of gold nanocrystal cores to guide the overgrowth of Cu2O shells. Surface properties of Cu2O nano- and microcrystals with sharp faces have been examined in a few studies. The {1 1 1} faces were found to interact well with negatively charged molecules, while the {1 0 0} faces are less sensitive to molecular charges. Preferential adsorption of sodium dodecyl sulfate molecules on the {1 1 1} faces of Cu2O crystals has been demonstrated via plane-selective deposition of gold nanoparticles on only the {1 0 0} faces.

     "abstract": "Graphene microcircuits have been successfully created on graphene oxide films via direct femtosecond laser reduction process according to preprogrammed patterns. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization shows that surface height of the micropatterns was lower than the rest of the film due to the loss of oxygen confirmed by XPS and XRD techniques. The electric resistivity and conductivity of as-reduced graphene have strong dependences on output power of femtosecond laser. Moreover, current–voltage curves of graphene microcircuits show typical linear relationship, indicating the stable conductivities. The micro-nanoprocessing of graphene through femtosecond laser technologies might open the door for applications of graphene-based materials in electronic microdevices.",

     "abstract": "This communication refers to the design of a novel, highly efficient and uniform substrate for SERS. The method takes advantage of the block copolymer micelle nanolithography concept for making well-ordered and uniformly spaced gold nanodot assemblies, which are subsequently used as seed substrates for chemical growth, thereby yielding Ag nanoparticle arrays containing a high density of hot spots, which render these concentrated island films ideal substrates for reproducible surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection.",

     "abstract": "Processing of flame-made nanoparticles into polymers is reviewed including surface modification and compounding. Recent advances in combustion and aerosol science enable scalable synthesis of such nanoparticles way beyond today's commercially available nanostructured carbon black and fumed silica. As a result, sophisticated filler nanoparticles with closely controlled size, morphology (aggregates or agglomerates) and composition (segregated or mixed phases or nanothin coatings onto core particles) become available motivating research for their surface functionalization and dispersion. Emphasis is placed on nanocomposite mechanics and optics. Quantitative relations for optimal nanocomposite structure are presented: from the particle–polymer interface to the formation of a percolation network.",

     "abstract": "The nanoscale surface topography of artificial materials is known to play a significant role in interactions with biological systems such as proteins and cells. A detailed understanding, and ultimately control, of these interactions is therefore of utmost importance in areas such as cell culture technology, biosensing and medical device development. We briefly review different methods to synthesise and fabricate surfaces with well-defined nanoscale topography, and discuss how such nanostructured surfaces can be used as model systems in protein and cellular assays. Finally, an outlook of possible future in vitro and in vivo developments is provided.",
