     "abstract": "Certain ionic liquids (ILs) can be used to pretreat biomass to improve enzymatic hydrolysis of polysaccharides; however, residual ILs may inhibit biofuel production. In this study, the impact of NaCl on cell growth and isoprenol production of E. coli in the presence of ILs was studied. The final biomass of E. coli MG1655 and DH1 were in the presence of 50 mM 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C4C1Im]Cl) and 50 mM 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C4C1Im][OAc]) when 200 mM NaCl was added. Isoprenol production by E. coli DH1's was also increased in the presence of imidazolium-based ionic liquids when the culture emedia were amended with 200 mM NaCl. However, isoprenol production by E. coli MG1655's isoprenol production was decreased or less affected in the presence of ILs.",

     "abstract": "Light availability inside the photobioreactor is generally measured by the Lambert – Beer law. However, Lambert - Beer law assumptions are not valid at high cell density cultural conditions, because light scattering and differential absorption have significant impact on light transfer in photobioreactor. In this study Lambert – Beer law was modified by applying differential absorbance in flat panel photobioreactor. As light intensity fluctuate with location and age in the cultivation process, aconsolidated model based on Lambert – Beer law including temporal light evolution and microorganism growth is presented. The model was calibrated under specific light intensity of 133 μmol m−2 s−1 and validated using the experimental data of microalgae growth under varying light conditions of 174, 261 and 348 μmol m−2 s−1. Maximum biomass concentration, maximum lipid content and lipid productivity were 2.52 g dcw L−1, 19.76% and 114.92 mg L−1d−1 at 261 μmol m−2 s−1 light intensity respectively.",

     "abstract": "This work focuses on the segregation of microbial populations in Electrochemically Active Biofilms (EAB) fed by glucose under continuous flow, simulated with a 2D bioanode model. In the model several reactions take place in parallel (fermentation, electroactivity, methanogenesis), performed by four microbial metabolic groups. Bioconversion yields and rate parameters were estimated by a thermodynamic approach. The model results include biomass segregation according to metabolic activity, distribution of concentrations of solutes and current production along the anode. This numerical tool exhibits an acceptable numerical cost (7000 nodes and below 35,000 degrees of freedom) to evaluate innovative designs for enhancing the bioelectrochemical reactor efficiency using a multicriteria approach. Therefore, a multi-objective optimization (coulombic efficiencies and organic removal rates) was achieved and highlights a Pareto front, showing that relatively high coulombic efficiencies (60–70%) can be obtained with a high removal rate ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 g COD cm−3 d−1.",

     "abstract": "Lactic acid has applications in many different sectors such as food, chemicals and polymers. Its production from lignocellulosic materials has been highlighted as a possibility to overcome barriers in the production chain such as decreasing process costs and reaching better environmental performance, besides adding value to biomass. However, the needed pre-treatment that lignocellulosic material goes through to release fermentable sugars also produces inhibitor compounds for the microorganisms, such as HMF and furfural. In this work, a Bacillus coagulans strain is evaluated as an l-lactic acid producer using sugarcane bagasse hemicellulosic hydrolysate. l-Lactic acid production reached 55.99 g/L, 0.87 g/g of yield, 1.7 g/ L h −1 of productivity and 99.4% of isomeric purity. Simultaneous bio-detoxification removed 100% of HMF and furfural without any treatment prior.

The particle sizes of Dx(10) and Dx(50) were decreased from 16.4 μm and 55.4 μm to 3.69 μm and 12.9 μm, respectively, under a 600 W ultrasound input with the CMC of SDBS. As the surfactant dosage was further increased (0.05 SDBS g/g TS), the maximum increment rates of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus were obtained at 1250.1% and 197.1%, respectively. However, higher pre-treatment efficiency could be achieved when SDBS was below the CMC. It related to the decrease of surface tension. Based on the economic evaluation, the total cost significantly increased when the amount of surfactant was greater than the CMC.",

Industrial vinasse was characterized and then tested in its raw form as culture medium. Relatively high concentrations of lipids were observed (approximately 23%), and biomass accumulation can be enhanced by the addition of corn steep liquor (approximately 5-fold increase when compared to control). Phenolic compounds present in vinasse pose inhibitory effects in biomass and lipid accumulation. The pelletized hyphae then proceeded to a simple sieve separation, on which lipids were extracted in a microwave extraction system, with a resulting fatty acid profile that indicate a potential suitable feedstock for biodiesel production due to the balance of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.",

TZ was completely removed at incubation temperature of 30 °C, initial pH of 7.0 and initial concentration of 100 mg L−1 within 288 h, which was accompanied by obvious TOC removal, NH4+ release, pH increase, biomass growth, biotoxicity reduction and excitation emission matrix (EEM) variation. TZ biodegradation profile by Raoultella sp. was well fitted by the first-order degradation kinetic model, confirming the inhibitory nature of TZ. Based on HPLC/MS analysis, a distinct TZ biodegradation pathway including hydroxylation, carbonylation, carboxylation and ring cleavage, was proposed for the first time. Compared with other TZ degrading species such as Shinella sp., Raoultella sp. showed relatively higher TZ removal efficiency, demonstrating great potential for the application in biological treatment of wastewater containing TZ in practice.",

     "abstract": "The demand for plastics that are produced from biological resources, easily recyclable and biodegradable, has increased in recent years. However, their application in plastic-bead industries, such as recreational shooting sports, fishing, and disposable ornaments, has been limited due to high cost of the production. One of reasons for the high cost is involvement of extraction and purification processes of biopolymers, the raw materials produced in organisms for bioplastic production. It was previously found that Chlamydomonas reinhardtii produces a large amount of triacylglycerol, the ingredient of biopolymers, following centrifugation (Kato et al., Biteb, doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biteb.2018.10.003). This article reports that the triacylglycerol produced in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can be directly molded, without extraction and purification, into a 7 mm bead that withstands compressive stress to 1.7 megapascals. With further research and development, the method developed in this study may help to produce disposable bioplastic-beads economically in industry.",

     "abstract": "Microalgae have high energy potential, however, it is expensive to use them only for energy production. To improve the sustainability of microalgae utilization, in this study, hydrothermal carbonization was combined with the protein isolation and nutrient recovery, so that added-value co-products were generated together with the hydrochar. Through pH shifting, up to 63% of the microalgae protein was isolated. The protein removal resulted in an increase in the hydrochar and the carbon recovery yield, as well as a reduction in the nitrogen content of the hydrochar. This increases the fuel quality of the char. Moreover, the protein isolation tends to be more effective towards to Chlorella vulgaris than to Spirulina platensis. After the hydrothermal conversion, the majority of the phosphate‑phosphorus in microalgae was released into the process water, from which up to 85% of the total phosphorus was recovered as struvite.",

The corresponding quantification of genus Geobacillus and proteolytic genes in WAS were explored. Diverse hydrolysis bacteria with a strong ability to degrade proteins and amino acids were detected. Bacterodies were enriched to utilize hydrolysis organics to directly produce organic acids.

By a statistical analysis of the fit of 7 equilibrium models and 2 model combinations to experimental data, it was observed that the adsorption occurred in a single molecule monolayer for final dye concentrations lower than ~63 mg L−1. After this concentration, a possible multimolecular monolayer was verified, evidencing the formation of aggregates or micelles, since the Langmuir-BET model was the best fit. The maximum adsorption capacity estimated was about 19 mg g−1.

Performance-enhancing strategies surveyed include: (1) parameter optimization, (2) physical, chemical, and biological pretreatments, (3) additives, (4) co-digestion, (5) bioreactor design, (6) genetic engineering of enzymes and microbial strains, and (7) coupling technologies of multiple enhancing techniques. Industrial applications of these strategies in AD are also discussed. Finally, current state of AD of SOWs to energy is compiled and several future development prospects of strategies in enhancing biogas production are highlighted.",

Though microalgae based biofuels are acknowledged as an alternative and renewable source of energy, mass cultivation and subsequent bioprocessing of microalgal species are the most challenging steps from a technological perspective. Hence, this article attempted to summarise the ecological and bioprocess principles involved in microalgal cultivation, with detailed discussion on various influencing factors for biofuel production. Further, it explored the real trait of microalgae through both thermochemical and biochemical conversion processes for the production of various biofuels such as biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane, bio-oil, biohydrogen and other products. The integrated zero waste microalgal biorefinery concept was discussed briefly to promote sustainability on the commercial implementation of the microalgal biofuel technology. Future research challenges on microalgal biotechnology for commercial biofuel production were highlighted based on the existing limitations of bioprocess principles.",

A single enzyme will not degrade the biomass efficiently hence it needs to consider for a cocktail of enzymes.

In addition, the accumulated TAGs contain only trivial amount of C18:1 (11) and C18:3 (5,9,12) fatty acids that are more abundant in TAGs accumulated under N-starved condition. Overall, TAGs that are induced by centrifugation contain more saturated fatty acids than that induced by N starvation.

While higher TN removal (85–92%) was found in SWISs with biochar addition. In addition, better removal performances of NH4+-N (above 96%) and TP (above 98%) were achieved simultaneously in all SWISs. The results indicated that biochar played an important role in improving nitrogen removal in SWISs with a negative effect on organics removal. Moreover, intermittent aeration and biochar addition could significantly reduce the N2O emission in SWISs.",

The functional groups existing in EPS exert a great influence on sludge performances. EPS are responsible for pollutant's removal and especially they are closely related to the removal of exogenous toxic compounds, which protect sludge aggregates in WWTPs when exposed to toxic substances. It is necessary to understand the interaction mechanism of EPS and exogenous toxic compounds in order to provide instructions to improve performance of Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) when confronting toxic substances. This paper overall reviews the EPS definition, structure, chemical composition, source, extraction methods and interaction mechanism between EPS and heavy metals, toxic organic compounds. In addition, based on these understandings, several future research niches are provided for further study of EPS.",

It indicated that lignin in CCR was the main factor for the loss of cellulase in hydrolyzate. During CCR's hydrolysis, β‑glucosidase, xylanase, endoglucanase III (EGIII) and EGV were rapidly adsorbed on lignin and weren't released in subsequent, however, cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI), CBHII, EGI and EGIV were mainly adsorbed on cellulose in the early stage. With the hydrolysis of substrate, cellulase on cellulose would be released into hydrolyzate, but cellulase in hydrolyzate gradually became hydrophobic and much easier to be adsorb on lignin by the increasing hydrophobic interaction.

The hydrolysate contained a mixture of monosaccharides, oligosaccharides and micronutrients. To ferment this material the oleaginous yeast Metschnikowia pulcherrima was selected and was able to metabolise the material including some of the oligosaccharides of approximately DP8 and below, producing a lipid that was highly monounsaturated. On the laboratory scale 11% lipid could be achieved from the rapeseed meal alone, with a lipid profile akin to palm oil. On the addition of glycerol to increase the C:N ratio, over 16 g/L of yeast was achieved with lipid content of 38% w/w. To demonstrate the scalability of the microbial process, the fermentation was demonstrated on depolymerised rapeseed meal with glycerol, in a 30 L pilot scale fermenter, yielding 12 g/L of yeast with 22% w/w lipid over 120 h.

Dependence of activation energies on fractional conversions and nonparallel nature of Friedman plots also support the results obtained from master plot method. Arrhenius constants determined from Friedman activation energy values are in the range of 1.74 × 1018–5.78 × 1023 min−1 for SB1 and 1.61 × 1020–5.31 × 1023 min−1 for SB2. Our results also demonstrate that combination of FWO or KAS method with Friedman method is a powerful tool for estimating apparent activation energies of biomass residues.",

The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolytic kinetics of PKS and LC were investigated by heating up to 1000 °C at a different heating rate of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 °C/min. With the increase of heating rate, the TG profile of both PKS and LC were found different. For the gasification kinetics of PKS and LC, the activation energy (E) was 56.92 and 74.69 kJ/mol along with the exponential factor (A) as 9.391 × 103 and 6.740 × 103 min−1 respectively. In case of cogasification studies, the activation energy for the blends of PKS and LC at various ratios were found lowered to the range of 56–66 kJ/mol.

The results were analyzed in concurrence with prediction of astaxanthin solubility using UNIFAC (Universal Quasi-Chemical Functional-Group Activity Coefficients) method and simulations of cavitation bubble dynamics. The highest astaxanthin yield of 1536 ± 3 μg/g DCM was obtained for solvent comprising 33% v/v DMSO + 67% v/v acetone. UNIFAC predicted astaxanthin solubility (1.57 g/L) was also highest for this composition, although the convection intensity predicted by bubble dynamics simulations was relatively low.

Adjustment of published energy ratio metrics to account for ACP treatment reveals that energy yield is moderately decreased, and energy consumption for COD, TN, and TP removal is of the same order of magnitude as liquefaction. Recovery of valuable nutrients (i.e., N and P) from ACP via precipitation could reduce the energy intensity of ACP management and mitigate its impact on energy recovery.

     "abstract": "This study investigated Cr (VI) adsorption from aqueous solution onto aerobic granular sludge (AGS) and then its desorption to recover Cr and regenerate AGS. AGS adsorption was conducted using batch experiments. Alkaline (CH3COONa, NaHCO3, Na2CO3, and Na2CO3 containing Na2HPO4 or KCl) and HCl solutions were attempted to desorb Cr (VI) and Cr (III), respectively. Their effects on microbial activity and granular stability were also explored. 0.5 M NaHCO3 was found to be the best desorption agent with desorption ratios of 62% for Cr (VI) and 10% for Cr (III). 0.1 M HCl could further desorb the remaining Cr (III), resulting in totally 81% of desorption ratio. Adsorption under acidic conditions decreased microbial activity, while desorption using alkaline solutions negatively affected granular stability to some extent, most probably attributable to cations release from AGS. These results for the first time suggest the possibility of Cr-loaded AGS regeneration by weak alkaline solutions.",

     "abstract": "Photosynthetic bacteria (PSB)-bioconversion is a novel method for wastewater treatment and resource recovery. But fundamental knowledge on effective substrate range, cell proliferation and substrate degradation kinetics are lacking. This paper studied the efficient range of carbon source (in terms of COD) and the fundamental kinetics of COD degradation and cell proliferation of this technology. Results showed that the efficient concentration range of carbon source was 500–40,000 mg·L−1 COD for PSB, which covers most organic wastewaters. Then the substrate degradation and cell proliferation kinetics were studied using Michaelis-Menten equation and Monod equation. The Vmax, Km, μmax and Ks was 4.80 d−1, 7382 mg·L−1, 1.23 d−1 and 7714 mg·L−1 under light-anaerobic condition, and they were 4.27 d−1, 4813 mg·L−1, 0.59 d−1 and 21,295 mg·L−1 under dark-aerobic condition; which fell in the range of conventional biological wastewater technologies. This benchmark study lays foundation for further study and scale-up of this novel technology.",

     "abstract": "The introduction of plant nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus in water bodies cause a natural ageing process called eutrophication. In the present study, 71.9% NO3−N and 93% ortho-P removal was achieved within 72 h by an aerobic denitrifier P.denitrificans ISTOD1, suggesting the strain as a potential denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organism (DPAO). To make wastewater treatment cost-effective, different concentration of molasses were optimized for maximum EPS production. Application of strain ISTOD1 in real wastewater samples with 5% molasses resulted in NH4+-N, NO2−N, NO3−N, TN, COD and TP removal efficiencies of 99.6%, 79.2%, 83.8%, 97.3%, 84.2% and 100%. Moreover, 1.9 g/L EPS production was also observed between late exponential- stationary phase. Assessment on wastewater demonstrated the capability of ISTOD1 in overall nutrient removal along with EPS production. Bioflocculation efficiency of the domestic wastewater produced EPS makes the strain an efficient candidate for enhanced wastewater remediation.",

     "abstract": "At low temperature, the presence of oleaginous compound with fatty acids bound to crystallize and cause operability problems with compression engines. In this present investigation, seven different fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) biodiesel from vegetable oils (such as sunflower, coconut, jatropha, rice bran, palm, neem and mahua) were prepared by transesterification and were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). Winterization of these synthesized biodiesel were carried out to find their usability at low temperatures (0 °C–20 °C) and the crystals formed were separated. Further, the differential scanning colorimetry (DSC) was employed to identify the onset of melting point of the biodiesel from vegetable oils. The results showed that crystal formation was observed for various biodiesel except sunflower oil that recorded no crystal formation with minimum temperature of 0 °C. These findings suggest that biodiesel synthesized from sunflower can be used as such at low temperatures compared to the other synthesized biodiesel from vegetable oil.",

     "abstract": "The fermentation of carbon dioxide (CO2) with hydrogen (H2) uses available low-cost gases to synthesis acetic acid. Here, we present a two-stage bio logical process that allows the g as t o l iquid transfer (Bio-GTL) of CO2 into the biopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Using the same medium in both stages, first, acetic acid is produced (3.2 g L−1) by Acetobacterium woodii from 5.2 L gas-mixture of CO2:H2 (15:85 v/v) under elevated pressure (≥2.0 bar) to increase H2-solubility in water. Second, acetic acid is converted to PHB (3 g L−1 acetate into 0.5 g L−1 PHB) by Ralstonia eutropha H16. The efficiencies and space-time yields were evaluated, and our data show the conversion of CO2 into PHB with a 33.3% microbial cell content (percentage of the ratio of PHB concentration to cell concentration) after 217 h. Collectively, our results provide a resourceful platform for future optimization and commercialization of a Bio-GTL for PHB production.",

Due to the unbalanced distribution of fossil fuels, as well as their environmental effects, the utilization of renewable energies sources has been one of the main strategies. Due to the importance of transportation for societies, biofuels technologies is important part of researches, in particular algae. Algae are a type of single or multi-cellular organisms that are multiplying rapidly, and have photosynthesis-based growth and evolution. In this paper, after classifying and determining the main factors affecting the production of liquid fuels from microalgae, the feasibility and the best regions for production are discussed in the case study, Iran. The analysis method is multi criteria decision making in order to rank the best locations for microalgae growing. The results show that Iran has a high potential for microalgae utilization and the coastlines of Oman Sea and the Persian Gulf are the best regions for large-scale algae cultivation and processing projects.",

     "abstract": "Enormous amounts of brewers' spent grains (BSGs) per year are generated to produce bear worldwide. BSGs can be used as a carbon source, biofuel to generate energy and as a source of biogas. Typically, BSGs contain >60 mass% of water and, therefore, drying kinetics is a paramount for the development of any of these valorisation processes.In this work, we reveal the main parameters and mechanism of drying kinetics of BSGs at isothermal conditions (60 °C–90 °C), measured by thermogravimetric analysis. Diffusion coefficients ranged from 1.42 × 10−9 m2 s−1 to 2.67 × 10−9 m2 s−1 while the activation energy was 26.6 kJ mol−1.Furthermore, for the first time, biodiesel production from BSGs is reported. We employed acid catalysed in situ transesterification process, at different catalyst concentrations, methanol to BSGs ratios, reaction time and temperature.The outcomes of our study show promise for alternative valorisation of brewers' spent grains, an abundant waste spread around the world.",

     "abstract": "Biomass gasification shows great potential to displace fossil fuels. This paper states the steady state simulation for the gasification of palm oil empty fruit brunch (EFB) in pilot plant downdraft reactor and modelled using Aspen Plus®. The biomass was characterized to evaluate the degree of feedstock's structural order. The effect of reactor temperature and pressure on syngas production of downdraft gasification of EFB at the constant steam flow rate of 186.37 mol/h were investigated. The results revealed the concentration of hydrogen and CO increased from 12 to 17.5 mol% and 55–60.6 mol% respectively, but the CO2 concentration decreased from 30 to 19.4 mol% with increasing temperature (875–975 °C) and pressure (25–35 bar). The results indicated that the product gas from co-gasification with charcoal has higher H2 and CO concentrations in comparison with the EFB gasification. Therefore, co-gasification of the feedstock has a significant potential to overcome the problem of disrupted feedstock supply in gasification.",

It has been proved to be protein-rich and hence can be used as fodder for cattle. Exploring the feasibility of H. verticillata has become prime importance in any of the application of it. However, there is a need to research on large-scale management and utilization of H. verticillata to benefit the agriculture field.

It has potential of being developed as a vehicular fuel or for generating electricity that can be injected into power grids. Despite its prospect, it faces criticism, such as limited contributions in reducing carbon emissions as compared to solar and wind. Consequentially, for higher efficiency and for better commercialization, it is impending not only to upgrade raw biogas but also utilize the energy value of off-gas. Currently available methods have high operating costs and are energy intensive, limiting the commercial applications of biogas. This review is aimed at presenting the state-of-art upgradation technologies currently available and the ones which are promising. It also discusses the future perspectives for overcoming the challenges associated with upgradation.",

The study explored the effect of chemicals on xylose yield, and the xylose production process was optimized as followings: After pre-impregnation with nitric acid at 140 °C for 15 min, rice straw was treated at 1 bar with 0.5% (v/v) nitric acid, followed by second hydrolysis by using 2.5%(w/v) sodium hydroxide with 2%(w/v) sodium hypochlorite at 121 °C for 1 h, decoloration and ionic impurities were removed by ion exchange. Using this process, 13.8 g of crystal xylose was produced from 100 g rice straw, simultaneously 26.01% (w/w) of cellulose, 10.11% (w/w) silica, and 6.21% (w/w) lignin were also extracted from rice straw respectively.
