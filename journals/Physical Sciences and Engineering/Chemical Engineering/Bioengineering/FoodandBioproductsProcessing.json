     "abstract": "In order to enhance the extraction efficiency of anthocyanins and subsequent comprehensive utilization of pomace from purple sweet potato (PSP), an improved microwave-assisted extraction (iMAE) of anthocyanins without dextrinization of starch was developed in this work. Firstly, the extraction conditions of PSP anthocyanins (PSPAs) were optimized by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and the optimal parameters were as follows: solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:3 (g/mL), ethanol concentration of 30% with a small quantity of critic acid as regulating reagent of pH, microwave irradiation power of 320 w, extraction time of 500 s. Under the conditions, the yield of anthocyanins was 31.16 mg/100 g PSP (RSD = 1.45%, n = 3), which was a relative error of −4.88% compared with the predicted value (32.76 mg/100 g PSP) by model of Response Surface Methodology. By HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis, the composition of anthocyanins obtained by iMAE is basically the same as that of ultrasound-assisted extraction with citric acid aqueous. And the residue obtained by iMAE was in its original appearance and the total sugar content (TSC) in pomace was 88.2% of that in fresh PSP. The iMAE provided a method for the quick extraction of anthocyanins with some advantages of high efficiency as conventional MAE, but avoided gelatinization of starch which is useful for further utilization of starch in pomace.",

     "abstract": "Whey is a byproduct of the cheese industry, which is potentially dangerous for the environment if it is not treated before its discharge. An alternative use for whey is as raw material to produce compounds with high added value as 2-phenylethanol (2-PE). Experimental production of 2-PE from whey using Kluyveromices marxianus as inoculum was evaluated. Maximum 2-PE concentration obtained was 780 mg/L and a lactose removal efficiency of 99.4% with the addition of l-phenylalanine (1 g/L) as a precursor and ammonium sulphate (NH4)2SO4 (450 mg/L) using a K. marxianus inoculums (1 × 106CFU/mL) at 30 °C/180 rpm. Based on experimental results the process simulation was performed on Aspen Plus V.10. Operation costs were estimated, and fixed costs projection was performed based on essential equipment. Two scenarios were established. In the first one, the sale of the product as an additive with the characteristics of fermentation output was considered; in which case, the breaking point of the process was calculated to obtain the minimal sale price estimate. On the second one, the 2-PE sale as a high purity product was considered and the income from the sale of the product with these characteristics was assessed.",

     "abstract": "The processing of instant coffee may involve pumping the material in a melt phase through operations at elevated pressures. The shear rheology of this material was investigated using the Cambridge multipass rheometer, which allows for shear rheometric testing under conditions of independently controlled temperature and pressure. In this work the back pressure was set to dissolve any air that was present in the melt, so that the rheology of the single phase material could be tested. Data were collected over the accessible range of conditions; shear rates from 0.01 to 1000 s−1, temperatures from 80 to 110 °C, and pressures from 0.01 to 300 bar. The melt exhibited thixotropic behaviour at low shear rates, and the data could be fitted to a non-dimensionalised Carreau fluid model with a temperature dependence which followed an Andrade relationship. Sample to sample variation was observed, which is attributed to differing water content. The results demonstrate how the rheology of complex food materials can be accessed under process conditions.",

     "abstract": "Fish meal is commonly employed as protein source in aquaculture diets. The enrichment of this ingredient with fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) and free amino acids has proved to improve larval development and feed assimilation. In this work, we produced tuna head hydrolysates using a sequential enzymatic treatment employing Alcalase and Flavourzyme. Statistical modelization coupled with bi-objective optimization were employed to optimize the operating parameters (i.e. pH, temperature and duration of the Flavourzyme treatment) for producing a FPH with a desired molecular weight profile. More specifically, this work focused on the content of small peptides between 700–2500 Da (F2500) and that of free amino acids (F250), supported by their benefits as aquaculture feed ingredients.The optimal reaction conditions for maximimizing the release of free amino acids F250 (i.e, pH 7.2, 43–49 °C, Flavourzyme treatment above 160 min) were detrimental for the content of F2500. A bi-objective optimization approach was then proposed, able to find a set of intermediary solutions (Pareto Front) presenting maximal F2500 for a range of free amino acids level between 2–30%. This allows the selection of the operating parameters for producing a FPH with a desired weight profile, based on the specific needs of the farmed species.",

     "publication date": "05-2019",
     "abstract": "Food waste causes great impact on society and the environment. Residues disposal is observed throughout the production chain, which establishes a need to use both food as a whole and the possibility of maintaining habitual consumption with the use of residues for new food products or in another industrial branch. In this perspective, this study aimed to evaluate the role of selected traditional organic solvents on the extraction of total soluble solids and bioactives from green coffee beans and its press meal as an alternative to make use of this waste generated by the oil industry. Six solvents with different polarities were used (acetone, ethanol, ethyl acetate, hexane, isopropanol, and petroleum ether) in order to evaluate the yield of soluble solids/oil and the bioactivity (Folin–Ciocalteau’s method, DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and β-carotene bleaching assay — BCBA) of green coffee beans and its industrial press meal. The results showed that the tested solvents played an important role in the extraction of total solids and antioxidant capacity from the matrices analyzed. Ethanol was found to be the optimal extraction solvent for extractable solids from both green coffee beans and meal, as well as for the phenolic and antioxidant compounds. Only that, for BCBA analysis, ethyl acetate yielded the best results for the antioxidant activity of green beans and meal. Therefore, ethanol is recommended for the extraction of soluble solids, phenolic, and antioxidant compounds from green coffee beans and its press meal for further isolation and utilization.",

     "abstract": "Microwave baking is gaining popularity due to improved time efficiency of the process as compared to the traditional convective baking. Several studies focused on combining microwave baking with other heating techniques in order to achieve desirable product properties. However, not much is known about the principles of combining these techniques for complex laminated structures like puff pastry. In this work, the independent influence of convection and microwave was studied for baking of puff pastry. Product properties such as moisture content, expansion, texture and color were characterized in order to assess the effect of the heating methods As compared to convection, microwave baking resulted in a much faster process, up to 5 times reduction in baking time, without significant difference in volume and hardness of the pastry. However, it led to a different structure formation in terms of pore size distribution. Browning quality of the product was more desirable and uniform in case of convection as expected. The study helped in understanding influence of convection and microwave heating on development of product properties during baking of laminated doughs. The knowledge from this study will be useful in forming combination of these heating modes for optimising the process further.",

Submerged fermentation of the components of mango wastes (peel, tegument and kernel) were performed with the components separately and their combinations without any supplementation. The tegument was the only part that showed promising results for lipase production and, therefore several nitrogen sources were used, separately, as supplementation. Yeast extract was the best nitrogen source for lipase production with mango tegument in submerged fermentation, achieving around 3500 U/L of extracellular lipase. Optimum conditions for lipase production were pH 5.0; 187 rpm of agitation speed; temperature of 27.9 °C and inoculum concentration of 0.96 g/L. Lipase activity of the solid residue obtained after fermentation carried out in the best experimental conditions was 68.03 U/(g of residue) evidencing that the lipase produced during fermentation adsorbed in the fermented solid, producing a new biocatalyst.",

     "abstract": "The aim of the work was to obtain and characterize powdered honey containing substantially higher amount of honey than was reported in literature before. For this purpose, dehumidified air was applied as a drying medium during spray drying at low temperature (inlet/outlet air temperature: 75/50 °C). This method gave the possibility to reduce carrier content in the final product. Apart from maltodextrin, used traditionally as drying carrier, NUTRIOSE characterized by prebiotic properties was also tested, to produce added-value honey powder. Drying parameters were adjusted compared to traditional high temperature spray drying to perform the process at high drying rate and yield (powder recovery). By using dehumidified air as the drying agent honey powders containing 80% of honey solids were obtained, with a yield above 80%. Both these values were higher than noted ever before in the case of honey spray drying. The physical properties of powders were typical for spray dried materials, although increased honey content resulted in increased hygroscopicity. Even though NUTRIOSE has a higher potential as a health promoting ingredient, compared to maltodextrin, it had lower potential as a drying carrier (powders had higher water activity and hygroscopicity).",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a novel pre-treatment, by dipping in a solution containing trehalose, sodium chloride, sucrose, and of drying process conditions (temperature and time) on drying kinetics and quality attributes of dried apple slabs. Drying experiments were carried out by convective drying at temperatures of 50, 55, 60 and 65 °C at a constant air velocity of 2.3 m/s. Pre-treatment provided an increment of moisture loss, and a reduction of drying time and shrinkage at all temperatures. The combination of pre-treatment and drying at 65 °C assured the lowest colour changes, the best preservation of structure, as well as the less shrinkage, the higher rehydration capacity and the highest score for sensorial overall acceptability. On the contrary, the used pre-treatment combined with lower drying temperatures (50 and 55 °C) better preserve the antioxidant activity of apple slabs. In conclusion, the proposed solution enabled to reduce the processing time and better retain the quality attributes (i.e. physical, chemical, nutritional, sensorial) of dried apples slabs for their commercialization as snacks.",

The influence of the degree of demineralization (number of diafiltration steps: 0; 0.75; 1.5) and DM content on each process step, whey protein denaturation and shelf life of whey concentrates was studied. Applying the ESL process, a strong bacterial reduction of 5.3–7.8 log cycles was achieved depending on the initial bacterial count. For the heat sensitive whey protein β-lactoglobulin, low thermal denaturation of 10–28% was observed, which was independent of DM content and degree of demineralization. However, the shelf life of NF whey concentrates was strongly dependent on their degree of demineralization and ranged between 2 and 16 weeks.",

They constitute an important information source to establish the stability of the products of argan and their conditions of conservation. The use of a suitable model for the analysis of the experimental data of sorption is a crucial step in the optimization and the design engineering setting on the scale of drying processes which are considered to be among the largest energy consumers in the chemical industry and agro-foodstuffs. The medicinal herbs are complex mixtures of chemical product that make it difficult to determine mass and heat mechanism. Digital simulations of the isotherms by the model of GAB (Guggenheim–Anderson–Boer) could not only correlate the equilibrium moisture content in food systems but also explain the different properties of sorbed water. Indeed, they are deemed of as helpful tools that allow better thermophysical valorization and lasting conservation. Net isosteric heat of sorption, total heat of wetting, differential entropy and spreading pressure were determined from the isotherms to define the energy associated with the sorption processes. The paper also investigates the impact of both the ionization (food irradiation) and the instant controlled pressure drop processes on water activity of the argan products.",

     "publication date": "03-2019",
     "abstract": "Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant renewable resource in existence and is the only source of renewable fixed carbon. Biofuels produced from this source are promising because they do not contribute to extra CO2 emissions and they reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Presently, wheat husk has a distinctive potential as a renewable source of biomass, due to its global availability, which is advantageous for producing liquid and gaseous fuels by thermochemical processes. The Thermo-Catalytic Reforming (TCR) process is excellent for generating energy vectors (solid char, liquid bio-oil and permanent gases) from agricultural wastes, such as wheat husk. These valorised energy vectors can be applied as transportation fuels and used in combined heat and power (CHP) plants. The aim of this work is to study the conversion of wheat husk into fuels, using TCR technology in a 2 kg/h continuous pilot scale reactor. Findings show that from 100 wt% of the feedstock, 29.6 wt% was converted into synthesis gas, 21.7 wt% to char, 5.8 wt% into organic bio-oil, 32.8 wt% into aqueous phase liquids and the remaining was attributed to losses (10.1 wt%). The organic bio-oil contains a higher heating value (HHV) of 26 MJ/kg, which represents a notable increase compared to the original feedstock (17.8 MJ/kg). Phenol was found to be the most abundant compound within the oil, with a relative abundance of 30.88% measured by GC–MS. Oleic acid (7.41%) was the most abundant long chain hydrocarbon detected. The total acid number of the oil (TAN) was (29.9 mg KOH/g) and viscosity measured (145.2 cSt). In order to use wheat husk oil as a direct engine fuel, it is necessary to carry out upgrading via hydro-processing; or blend with fossil crude oil for further refining. Overall, TCR is a promising future route for the valorisation of wheat husk to produce renewable energy vectors.",

Fresh produce are transported under high relative humidity to reduce fruit moisture loss and preserve quality. However, these conditions can progressively reduce carton mechanical strength over time as a result of mechano-sorptive creep. Little is known regarding the actual moisture dynamics in stacked cartons in RFCs, which is important for mechanical strength assessments. To this end, a portion of a fully loaded RFC was investigated using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, with respect to moisture transport in the air and the corrugated fibreboard. Simulations included the effects of loading, defrost cycles, fruit respiration and transpiration.Results showed relatively low moisture content gradients in fibreboards through the stacked cartons under optimal shipping conditions. However, the initial activation of the RFC considerably accelerated the development of moisture content gradients in the cartons. Additionally, the most significant factor influencing spatial moisture gradients through the cartons was heat conduction from outside through the container wall.",

In the present study, a low-cost catalyst (CC–SO3H) was synthesized by partial carbonization and sulfonation of crystalline cellulose, which was thermally stable and reactive at 160 °C in 5 times repeated batch of thermohydrolysis of cassava starch. The catalyst was studied for its potential role in the hydrolysis of cassava starch as a standard feedstock. It was shown that the milling of cassava starch in the presence of the CC–SO3H catalyst improved the solid-state reaction that enhanced porosity, increased surface area and decreased crystallinity of the starch granules. These phenomena caused the rapid thermohydrolysis of starch with an exceptionally high starch conversion rate (96.43%), glucose yield (93.12%), and glucose selectivity (95.32%) within 2 h of reaction at 160 °C, 10 bar.

DIC treatment is usually performed on partially dried samples. It starts with a heating/pressurizing stage for a short thermal treatment time to end by an instant depressurization towards a vacuum. In the present case, orange-peel was DIC-textured to be airflow oven dried at 40 °C, 2 m s−1, and 265 Pa of vapor as relative humidity, to reach a final moisture of about 0.05 g H2O/g db. By assuming this operation as shrinkage-free with conditions of Negligible External Resistance (NER), the Coupled Washing/Diffusion (CWD) was applied as phenomenological drying kinetic model, and its effects were perceptively identified through the starting accessibility (δWs) and the effective diffusivity Deff of water within the textured material. DIC-texturing was also recognized as a pretreatment possibly able to improve the solvent extraction of phenolic compounds. Four phenolic compounds were identified by HPLC assessments; namely hesperidin, rutin, flavone, and naringin. DIC allowed growing them from 12.10 to 65.01 (537%); from 11.47 to 27.10 (236%); from 0.006 to 0.007 (117%); and from 0.0002 to 0.00032 (160%) mg/g db, respectively.

Mangoes were subjected to pulses of UV light and dried in a convective oven-drier.

In this work, we are interested in the storage of water by these microalgae. A model based on the statistical physics formalism is one of the supports for imagining the arrangement of water molecules on Spirulina surface. On the basis of this method, we have interpreted, on a microscopic scale, adsorption isotherms of water molecules by the Spirulina biomass at three temperatures (283 K, 293 K and 303 K). We interpret the results of the fit through the parameters involved in the model namely the number of water molecules adsorbed per site n, the receptor sites density D and the energetic parameters e1w and e2w, determined by fitting the experimental adsorption isotherms. Lastly we calculated the thermodynamic functions which govern the adsorption process such as entropy, free enthalpy and internal energy.",

     "abstract": "Reverse osmosis with polyamide spiral wound membranes is used to concentrate milk to reduce its volume before transport to processing facilities. The main aim of this work was to identify the cause of unusually low flux through a membrane that had been used in an industrial facility. The fluxes of new and used industrial membranes were measured using a flat-sheet cross-flow laboratory system. It was found that the fouling characteristics of laboratory fouled membranes were entirely different from the industrial membrane. The laboratory membranes could be restored to a high flux with a regime of water flushing, caustic and acid. FTIR showed no significant build-up on the membrane. In contrast the industrial membrane could not be cleaned in this manner. FTIR and FT-Raman showed species associated with milk lipids. Cleaning by solvent extraction using a two-phase mixture of water, isopropanol and cyclohexane increased the flux from 1% to almost 50% of the value of a new membrane. Analysis of the solvent-extracted material indicated the presence of phospholipids with a relatively high concentration of sphingomyelin. It was concluded that the laboratory experiments did not mimic industrial processes and an effective industrial cleaning system was not found.",

     "abstract": "Downstream purification processes often determine the manufacturing costs of biotechnological products, particularly for those with high yields in the upstream synthesis processes. Rhamnolipids are important biosurfactants with promising industrial applications. Significant research has been focused on optimizing rhamnolipid production in the upstream fermentation but there are very few studies on downstream processing. The objective of this study is to fill this critical technological gap by (1) tracking the recovery and purity of rhamnolipids processed through different unit operations and (2) developing new and more environmentally friendly downstream processing methods. A biopolymer removal step using alcohol precipitation was found effective in improving the recovery, from 66% to 78%, and giving about 87% purity in the product collected by acid precipitation without further solvent extraction. A reverse aqueous extraction method, which was optimized to recover 97% rhamnolipids from the solvent (ethyl acetate) extract, was examined as an alternative to the commonly used but costly, energy-intensive solvent vaporization. As a polishing step, calcium precipitation was optimized to selectively remove residual impurities while keeping all major rhamnolipid congeners in solution. The study also identified the presence of excess oil substrate/derivatives in the fermentation broth as a strongly negative factor to the downstream processing. The feeding strategy of oil substrate in fermentation should be carefully designed.",

     "abstract": "In the south of China, green Tofu, comprised of a large amount of green and pollution-free cellulose, is one of most characteristic traditional foods in the local diet. Inspired by the preparation of the traditional green Tofu, we report a general protocol to fabricate biomass carbon aerogel based on extraction of cellulose from the plant leaves, freeze-drying and carbonization of cellulose. In this strategy, the plant leaves-derived celluloses were extracted from premna microphylla (PM) leaves and sisal leaves via alkalization and bleaching processes. Then, the superhydrophobic hierarchical porous carbon-X aerogel (SHPC-X aerogel) with ultralow density and excellent elastic properties were observed by carbonizing the freeze-dried celluloses. The incorporation of plant cellulose into aerogel could not only improve the specific surface areas and morphologies, but also enhance hydrophobic properties and mechanical properties of materials. When the sisal cellulose content of 200% (sisal: PM cellulose mass ratio), the SHPC-200 aerogel exhibited robust superhydrophobicity (WCA = 158°) and large specific surface areas (475.68 m2 g−1). In addition, the as-prepared SHPC-200 aerogel exhibited high absorption capacity (77.7–147.3 g g−1) for different oils and organic solvents and excellent oil recoverability, high durability, and regenerability during oil/water separation for 10 cycles. This study provides an effective strategy for fabrication of biomass carbon aerogel by using PM leaves as raw material that can be extended for the fabrication of other biomass aerogels for application in chemical separation, environmental remediation and energy storage.",

The model accounts for condensation heat transfer and predicts the sample’s core temperature evolution with time. The simulation was performed at different relative humidity of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% with constant temperature of 383 K. Results showed that the heat transfer process of HHAIB is divided into two stages based on vapor–liquid phase transition, namely a condensing heat transfer segment and a non-condensing heat transfer segment. In the initial stage of HHAIB, a comprehensive and intense condensation occurred on the sample surface leading to high heat transfer coefficient and greatly enhancing heat transfer, but at the same time creating a huge temperature gradient in the sample. The relative humidity of 40%–60% at 383 K could not only enhance the heat transfer rate but also improve the homogeneity of temperature distribution in the sample. Simulated core temperatures were compared with experimental measurements, showing good agreement with a coefficient of determination R2 of 0.991. The findings of current work provide theoretical basis to better design and control of the process conditions of HHAIB as it elucidates the heat transfer characteristic taking account condensation phenomenon and illustrates the temperature distribution and evolution profiles.",

The complexity that arises when multiple units are operated in parallel seems to have received little attention. This work aims at illustrating this complexity and delineates the arising plantwide control problem. Guidelines for optimised operation are derived from general process understanding and at hand of an industrial case study. The need for a predictive model to solve multiple scheduling problems is identified, and a mathematical model based on conventional filtration theory is derived. Due to raw material variability and operational uncertainties, the predictions are found to be too imprecise for deployment. This is expected to be representative of many bio-based processes, where manual scheduling needs to be integrated effectively into plantwide control structures.",

Sugar as a sweetener is very commonly added in various dairy products, however, severe fouling is found in on-site operations when processing sweetened dairy products. While milk fouling has been studied extensively, the compositional effect of sugar in dairy products on their fouling is still elusive. Here, we investigated the effect of different sugars (glucose, fructose and sucrose) on the fouling behavior of whey protein. Fouling formations were conducted using model solutions consisting of whey protein isolate (WPI) and sugars in a spinning disc apparatus under well-controlled temperatures and shear stresses. We found that, WPI fouling was reduced for the solutions with 10 wt% of sugar added by more than 30% in terms of fouling resistance and deposit mass, regardless of the type of sugar. We postulate that this reduction was because of the stabilizing effect of sugar on WPI, which was confirmed experimentally by the increased denaturation and aggregation temperatures of whey protein in the sugar-added WPI solutions. Increasing shear stress reduced the fouling of all test solutions, but no deposit sloughing was observed for the sugar-added WPI solutions. The addition of sugar in WPI solution also affected the composition and morphology of the deposits, which had lower protein in content and higher porosity in structure.",

Membrane rejection towards total phytosterols, proteins, sugars were determined along with antioxidant activity. The regenerated cellulose membrane displayed the highest permeate flux (a pseudo steady-state value of 22 L m−2 h−1), with a higher fouling index (75%) and a good separation efficiency of phytosterols (32% rejection towards phytosterols) from orange juice. Although the yield of phytosterols was relatively low (40 mg/L), there is a great potential to optimise the filtration process to produce commercially relevant amount of phytosterols. All membranes investigated displayed cleaning efficiencies of >95%.",

This paper reports an in-depth study of the impact of membrane chemical ageing due to NaOCl disinfection on the fouling and cleaning of PES/PVP membranes.Fouling by skim milk was performed at critical and limiting flux found to have an impact on the initial irreversible fouling, i.e. the one remaining after water rinsing. Furthermore, for filtrations performed with pristine membranes, the fouling removal by formulated alkaline detergents was also affected by the filtration conditions.On the contrary, aged membranes were highly irreversibly fouled whatever the operating conditions. Furthermore, they were shown to be more difficult to clean than pristine ones.Besides these results, this study provides the validation of an original approach based on the use of micro-waves activation to study the membrane degradation.",

The correlation between these methods was evaluated, since the chosen methods detect different characteristics of biofilms. Furthermore, enzymatic cleaning was applied after each experimental run. The results showed that the bacterial composition, material type, and fat content significantly affect the results of viable-cell counting (p ≤ 0.05). Flow conditions and material type both have significant influence upon biomass-quantification results (p ≤ 0.001).

Their adherence behaviour was determined under controlled hydrodynamic conditions using the non-contact technique of fluid dynamic gauging (FDG). FDG utilises flow data to estimate (i) the adhesive (between biofilm and substrate)/cohesive (between cells and extracellular polymeric substances) strengths, and (ii) the thicknesses of biofilms. The thickness of single and mixed species biofilms increased linearly with time and plateaued at 14 days with no significant reduction thereafter. The asymptotic thickness of mixed species biofilm were thinner than E. coli biofilms. The adhesive strength, on the other hand, peaked at approximately 14 days with a significant reduction thereafter. The results showed that the development of biofilm thickness and attachment strength are not affected by the range of surface roughness and surface energy employed. However, the increase in strength is strongly correlated to the protein and glucose content of the biofilms. Confocal laser scanning microscopy results confirmed an increase in the percentage of dead cells after 21 days, contributing to the weakening of the biofilms. Interrupting the flow of media during biofilm development had a negligible impact upon the thickness, but was found to significantly increase the biofilm strength.",

The adhesion of Bacillus cereus and B. megaterium spores was shown to differ significantly between spore type, spore cultivation conditions and substrate. The characteristic shear stresses required to remove 50% of the spore lawns were significantly greater than those imposed by standard industrial pipe flows. The R. palustris biofilms were uneven, with thicknesses ranging from 120 ± 37 to 280 ± 98 μm. The manner and rate of biofilm erosion was again strongly dependent on substrate.

Leaching into solution from the coatings alone was not related to the antimicrobial activity of the coatings. Copper and zinc showed the greatest propensity to leach from the coatings; silver, titanium, iron and molybdenum leached at lower rates and silicon showed no leaching. Copper demonstrated the greatest antimicrobial potential followed by silver and zinc. Titanium displayed the least antimicrobial potential, however using the standard method in humid conditions resulted in increased growth of Listeria.

The dimensionless particle diameter relates the particle size to the thickness of the viscous sublayer and has therefore been chosen to identify whether the particles were removed rather by diffusive or convective mass transport.This contribution presents the online measurement of particle size distributions during cleaning of starch and egg yolk soils in an automated laboratory test rig.

     "abstract": "To simulate cleaning processes is of constantly growing importance with regard to optimising the cleaning efficiency in food production lines. This requires suitable parameters to describe the cleaning behaviour of different soils. Therefore, a method was developed to determine the normal and shear stress, which are necessary to remove a swollen soil layer from a surface, by an impinging jet. The method consists of a cleaning procedure in combination with normal force measurements. For the cleaning tests, a stainless steel plate (AISI 304 with a 2B finish) with a defined soil layer was soaked reproducibly for a defined time. Subsequently, a very short impulse of a liquid jet impinged on the surface in order to determine the gauge pressure limit state, which is necessary to remove the soil from the surface in the impact area. At this determined limit state, the measurement was repeated with the same parameters, but with a piezo-based force sensor instead of the soiled surface. Out of this measured forces, it was possible to calculate the target values: the normal and the shear stress.Measurements were performed with petroleum jelly and egg yolk as a food based model soil at different jet angles and for different swelling times. As a result, it was possible to draw the calculated stress as a function of the jet angle. By that, it is possible to quantify and compare the cleaning behaviour of different soils and at different swelling states.",

Swelling studies of the foulants in cellulase (Celluclast®) (1–4 wt%, 55° C, pH 5.5, 2 h) were conducted using a gravimetric method. Continuous reduction of foulants mass was observed but the foulants remained at the end of 2 h. Larger mass reduction was observed when protease (Alcalase) was mixed with cellulase. Nevertheless, when lab-scale tests for cleaning in place (CIP) were conducted, the highest mass removal achieved was only 64.7%. This was significantly lower than 88.1% removal obtained with 1 wt% NaOH (70 °C, pH 13.7). Removal percentages of enzymatic cleaning also varied with foulants formed at different positions in a heat exchanger. Surfactants (LAS24 and LAS95) were then used to assist enzymatic cleaning. Although addition of surfactants improved cleaning efficiencies of enzymes, the cleaning efficiencies were lower than when using surfactants alone. Hence, cleaning in 2 steps was studied. Based on 1-stage CIP results, only cellulase and LAS24 were used in 2-stage CIP studies. Cleaning time of each step was varied but total cleaning time was 2 h. Using LAS24 first showed more removal and lower concentration of enzyme could also be used. Moreover, there was no variation in removal of the foulants at different positions. Using LAS24 (0.1 wt%, 1 h) followed by cellulase (0.012 wt%, 1 h) could remove the foulants to similar extent to using NaOH.",

The removal of this type of fouling is for the first time assessed using a laser triangulation sensor and a camera, to measure changes in the thickness and to visualize structural changes in the fouling in situ. The process was monitored during both the alkali and acid cleaning steps. There was no global swelling of the fouling layer during alkali cleaning under the investigated conditions. However, significant degradation of the protein network was observed, which affected the acid cleaning step and the efficiency of the cleaning process. We conclude that treatment with alkali is required to facilitate the removal of deposits with high mineral content during the acid cleaning step. The results have implications for optimizing the cleaning process so as to minimize energy expenditure, while ensuring efficient heat transfer and maintaining product quality.",

The suitability of these methods to predict the cleaning behaviour was tested by using a representative egg yolk deposit. Temperature (24–60 °C) and NaOH concentration (0–1.5%) of the cleaning fluid served as independent factors, and the time necessary to remove the deposit in a flow channel was evaluated using an optical method. Cleaning time decreased with increasing temperature and also depended on NaOH concentration. Within the examined limits, the pushing energy measured by the micromanipulation method showed the best correlation with cleaning time, whereas swelling, diffusion and rheological measurements only reflected tendencies of the cleaning behaviour.",

For long times, of tc = 10 min and 20 min, the area cleaned increased with L due to jet break-up increasing the area exposed to impact.For soils which are easy to clean (here ketchup) at shorter time scales (tc ≤ 0.1 min) a stand-off distance of L = 2 m gave optimal cleaned area. Soils which are hard to clean required small stand-off distances with short cleaning times.The cleaning results are compared with jet break-up, impact force and impact pressure results presented by Fuchs et al. (2018). Jet break-up gives a larger impact area which results in a more efficient cleaning for most soils. However, results of the cleaned area only correspond to measurements of jet impact area in the case of soils that are not swellable and hard to clean.Binding forces within the soils were determined with a micromanipulation apparatus. Results show that the basic cleaning behaviour of the soils can also be determined on a laboratory scale without using a water jet. This allows the prediction of cleaning behaviour without extensive cleaning tests as well as preselection of cleaning devices.",

The amount of liquid lost to splatter was measured and found to be insensitive to L for short L (<300 mm for these nozzles) and strongly related to L for longer values. The shape of the radial flow zone on flat walls agreed with existing models once the fraction of liquid lost to splatter was accounted for. Tests on horizontal and vertical cylinders with curvatures in the range 6.9 – 20 m−1 showed that the curvature of the impinged wall did not affect the shape of the radial flow zone until higher flow rates (>1.5 dm3 min−1).

The effects of temperature, flow rate and alkali concentration were investigated. The results show that pulsed flows improve cleaning behavior, where pulsing with a shorter period and higher frequency results in the most deposit removal at the same detergent consumption. The impact of pre-wetting is less significant under the investigated conditions. Some findings are consistent with earlier reports, stating that higher temperature and flow rate improve cleaning by reducing cleaning time. An optimal alkali concentration exists, which is in line with results reported by other researchers when investigating other protein soil types. The economic benefits by using pulsed flow cleaning were discussed. Then, scale-up tests confirmed that the enhancement of cleaning by using pulsed flow with short period and high frequency could also apply in an industry-scale tank.",

Global yield, total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity by DPPH and FRAP methods, total reducing sugars and the concentration of the major phenolic compounds by HPLC were evaluated in the extracts. Temperature and ethanol concentration had significant effects on all responses. The main volatile compound found in the SFE extract was α-Terpineol, followed by d-Limonene. The major phenolic compound was hesperidin, which highest recovery (19.3 ± 0.9 mg/g dry peel) was achieved with 75% ethanol at 65 °C from Lot 1. At the same condition, high TPC and antioxidant capacity were also achieved. The three-line spline and two-site kinetic models provided good adjustments to the PLE curves, being able to describe their behavior.

     "abstract": "A methodology for the simulation of spirits continuous distillation was developed and applied to the analysis of an Armagnac unit, using the software ProSimPlus®. Distillation data for 66 aroma compounds were acquired during an experimental campaign and 32 of these species were simulated with the NRTL model, using interaction parameters estimated from equilibria data at high dilution.Validation of static simulations against reconciled experimental data showed that the recovery of aroma compounds from wine to distillate can be predicted with good precision. Considering relative volatilities and composition profiles, three main groups of aroma compounds were proposed: (I) light compounds (recovered in distillate), (II) intermediary compounds (distributed between distillate and vinasse) and (III) heavy compounds (recovered in vinasse).After validation of the nominal point, the influence of some operating parameters was investigated. According to simulation, three parameters, namely, tails extractions, ethanol concentration in distillate and distillate temperature, have a real impact on Spirit composition. They permit a preferential reduction of intermediary and heavy species with respect to ethanol. Comparison with experimental and literature data confirms that simulation is a powerful and reliable approach to analyze the synergy between process operation, its performance and Spirit composition.",

The influence of pressure (100 and 200 bar), flow rate (1–3 mL min−1) and time (0–60 min) on the antioxidant capacity (DPPH) and chemical composition were evaluated. Results indicated that the highest antioxidant potentials were obtained at 10 min and ranged from 34.01% to 76.33%. Gallic acid and ellagic acid were extracted at 100 bar and 200 bar, respectively, regardless of the flow. On the other hand, caffeic acid, rutin and mangiferin were extracted in all conditions, regardless of the flow and pressure applied. In general, high antioxidant capacities were modulated by specific experimental conditions and the value may not be related only to content, but probably due to the presence of some compounds with strong power of radical scavenging (DPPH).",

Morphological analysis using different microscopic techniques, mainly SEM and Cryo-SEM, was carried out. This study was complemented with information acquired through Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and spectrophotometric determination of the amylose and amylopectin concentrations released from the granules. The gelatinization degree obtained by DSC increased accordingly with the intensity (pressure level and exposure time) of the HHP treatment, while the gelatinization temperature was scarcely affected. The presence of hydrocolloids in the suspension during HHP processing would ensure water availability. Almost complete gelatinization was observed for the sample treated at 700 MPa, both by DSC and XRD. At 400 MPa the gelatinization degree was significantly lower in starch with added xanthan gum (XG) in comparison to the other hydrocolloids, denoting a possible stabilization effect of XG on the starch granular structure during gelatinization. Maize starch granules (A-type XRD pattern), when submitted to HHP treatment, showed characteristic peaks of A and B-type patterns. Signals of V-diffraction pattern, ascribed to amylose–lipid complexes, were detected by XRD in samples submitted to either very high pressure (700 MPa), long treatment times at 400 MPa (120 min) or in presence of hydrocolloids (at lower pressures and times). The formation of V-crystalline complex would be favored by hydrocolloids presence under pressure. These results correlated well with the lower concentrations of amylose released from granules after these treatments.",

For the first time, a simple, fast and low cost method, based on analysis of the resilience (spring back) of the noodle dough sheet during the sheeting process, is proposed for a quick assessment of noodle rheology during noodle production. To demonstrate the efficacy of the method, the effects of repeated lamination and flour variety on the mechanical behavior of yellow alkaline noodle (YAN) dough sheets were investigated. The deviation of YAN dough mechanical behavior from perfectly elastic and plastic models was studied by the use of recoil strain (εr) and Hencky strain (εH). The relative resilience of noodle dough sheets at the last sheeting pass (εrf/εHf) was introduced as a tool for a quick determination of the rheological behavior of raw YANs. The parameter ThickD (the % thickness decrease during processing) was also determined to evaluate the mechanical response of noodle dough sheets during processing. It was demonstrated that ThickD can be used as a reliable means of assessing resilience and gluten network development in YAN dough sheets during the sheeting process.",

     "abstract": "Industrial wastewater treatment using aerobic and anaerobic digestion using membrane bioreactor (MBR) has become popular due to its increasing worldwide application. MBR offers complete separation of solid–liquid by a porous membrane to produce high-quality effluent for potential non-potable water reuse. Dynamic membrane (DM) as alternative to the conventional membrane is suitable for both aerobic and anaerobic digestion. Throughout the years, DM technology has been applied to both systems and the performance was better than that of conventional membrane in terms of filtration capability, easy back washing, and in-situ reformation and economically favourable. Production of high-quality effluent with low total solid, high operational stability, treatment of wastewater under extreme conditions such as industrial wastewater has made DM used in aerobic or anaerobic systems significant. Some drawbacks remain, including membrane fouling with excessive layer cake formation made the reactor operation become unstable and time-consuming which also requires high energy for pumping. Dynamic membrane can alleviate these drawbacks using cake layer membrane itself as the filtration devices. In addition, DM uses low-cost materials as the support material, which is a better replacement to the more expensive and high maintenance conventional membranes. Further research is needed to investigate the conditions and characteristics in the dynamic membrane’s active layer cake, mechanism and its structure. Identification of the optimal conditions to ensure long-term operation thus improving final effluent without further post-treatment is also needed. In this mini review, in-depth DMs application on aerobic and anaerobic digestion is summarized and evaluated for industrial wastewater treatment.",

     "abstract": "The marine species microalgae are an attractive source of feedstock for biofuel production and other bio-products such as omega-3 fatty acids and aquaculture feeds. The prevailing main nutrients in seawater environment for their growth are believed to be more economical than freshwater in terms of their cultivation system which may lead to low cost for upstream processing. Hence, marine microalgae provide attractive potential to be further explored. However, harvesting process of microalgae is known to be too costly because of their dilute nature that accounts for 20–30% of the overall production costs rendering using microalgae as the raw material not economically feasible. Currently the various harvesting methods including centrifugation, flocculation, flotation, filtration and magnetic separation had been applied to harvest marine species. For instance, harvesting by electrolytic means that require less energy to harvest marine species compared to the freshwater species. This can potentially help to reduce the challenges related to the exploitation of microalgae biomass. However, different techniques have their own advantages and drawbacks, whereas their cost and energy requirement vary accordingly depending on the selection of marine microalgal strains, equipment used and/or the choice of harvesting aid (flocculants, surfactant). Thus far, no single technique may still be proposed. Therefore, this paper aims to provide further details of each method used focusing only for marine species of microalgae with their respective advantages and disadvantages.",

Direct and indirect techniques can be utilized to introduce antimicrobial compounds into food packaging materials. The increasing importance of the application of antimicrobial packaging has inspired a better understanding of these materials and the factors influencing the effectiveness of antimicrobial systems. This article is a review on the materials used for delivering antimicrobial substances with a focus on their main mechanisms of action and release when used for food contact applications. In this regard, the effects of antimicrobial agents on packaging properties will be discussed. Many challenges, including the controlled release of antimicrobial agents and the development of active packaging materials (mainly bio-based materials) with adequate barrier properties, transparency, tensile strength and other characteristics to meet the requirements of food protection and food safety, still remain to be solved in these new approaches to antimicrobial active packaging.",

     "abstract": "Intermittent drying is a common technique for food conservation. The objective of this work is to evaluate the effect of non-isothermal drying and the wave periods using the effective diffusivity (Deff), the glass transition temperature (Tg), their relationship to moisture content and the temperature of the product, as parameters for controlling quality deterioration. The heating–cooling profile was developed as a trapezoidal wave form using three different wave periods (τ:60, 120 and 160 min), with a midpoint temperature (Tm) of 50 °C and ∆T = 10 °C. The ascending (AC) heating–cooling treatment began at 40 °C, and the descending (DC) heating–cooling treatment began at 60 °C. The drying temperature (Ta), the surface temperature of the garlic (Ts), the internal temperature of the garlic (Ti), and the weight of the garlic slices were measured and recorded in real time. The Deff was calculated using the slope method. A higher drying rate was observed in the AC drying treatment. The Tg variations were associated with the Ti and moisture content of the garlic. The drying time (ts) for the AC and the DC heating–cooling profiles was found to be between 180 to 238 min.",

     "abstract": "Selenium (Se) is a rare element, usually in ionic form in aqueous media. The separation of selenium from aqueous solution has received considerable attention due to the large-batch application of selenide. In this work, the Mg–Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs)-functionalized biomass carbon aerogels (CAs) were fabricated by combining freeze-drying, carbonization with in-situ growth method. And the process for extracting selenium based on adsorption of CAs and “memory effect” of LDHs nanosheets has been developed. Firstly, CAs was prepared by alkalization, bleaching, freeze-drying and carbonization using the sisal fiber as precursor. Then, Mg–Al LDHs-functionalized CAs were fabricated by in situ growth of LDHs platelets on the CAs surfaces. The physical and chemical properties of the LDHs-functionalized CAs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). The SEM results showed that sisal cellulose fibers used in this paper have a smooth surface with a diameter about 8 μm and a length of several millimeters. Furthermore, the flowerlike nanosheets are uniform in both size and shape, with each LDHs nanoplatelet grafted to the CAs. The nitrogen sorption analysis confirmed that LDHs-functionalized CAs is mesoporous structure with the mesopores centered at about 3.5–5 nm and BET surface area of 165.26 m2/g. It is indicated that the maximum adsorption capacity of selenium on LDHs-functionalized CAs reached 73.6 mg[Se]/g. The adsorption time profile of selenium onto LDHs-functionalized CAs ndicates that the adsorption equilibrium was achieved within 4 h. After recycling 9 times, the regenerated LDHs-functionalized CAs still displayed high selenium absorption properties. Therefore, the high absorption capacity and excellent recycling capabilities of LDHs-functionalized CAs composites give the material an ideal choice for the selenium recovery in practical applications.",

     "abstract": "The hydrolysis kinetics of ice-cream wastewater was studied under subcritical conditions (130–230 °C and 20–60 bar) in a continuous stirred-tank reactor. The kinetic was monitored by measuring the degree of hydrolysis (DH, %) at different time intervals (up to 240 min). Samples of ice-cream wastewater were collected from the university dairy plant after a typical clean-in-place protocol. Overall, the reaction time and temperature significantly increased the DH, reaching a maximum value of 40.99 ± 0.81, 34.44 ± 0.47, 20.61 ± 0.42, and 5.74 ± 0.36% after 200–240 min at 130, 170, 200 and 230 °C, respectively. The experimental data were modeled using the Weibull distribution model showing a satisfactory correlation between experimental data and predicted values (R2 = 0.971). The apparent activation energy for subcritical hydrolysis was 37.53 ± 5.21 kJ mol−1. After 240 min of reaction, the hydrolyzates were recovered, and their antiradical ability was measured through free radical scavenging (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) method. Additionally, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory ability was determined. The inhibition of a free radical was found to increase linearly with the DH (R2 = 0.991). The hydrolysate recovered at 230 °C showed the highest ACE-inhibitory ability (98.0 ± 1.6%). The study outcomes present an opportunity for utilizing subcritical hydrolysis to convert wastewater into valuable materials.",

Experimental data obtained at laboratory scale is used to validate the proposed model. Experiments are conducted using a forced convection laboratory dryer at temperatures of 60 °C and 80 °C and air velocities of 0.2 and 0.7 m/s to dry chicory root cubes of 1 cm of side. Mathematical modeling is firstly used to represent the performance of the drying process with the temporal variations of the average humidity content, to determine diffusion coefficients, and afterwards, to obtain useful predictions on how the volumetric contraction of the cubes behaves under different operating conditions. The good agreements between experimental and predicted values prove that the proposed model can be applied to the precise description of experimental drying curves for chicory roots in three dimensions (3-D). In the ranges covered, the values of the effective moisture diffusivity were obtained between 5.63 × 10−5 and 8.21 × 10−5 cm2/s.

Batch cultivation experiments monitoring the cell growth and ethanol formation are conducted in laboratory scale in two reactor types — stirred tank and an Outotec OKTOP®9000 draft tube reactor. Model for the yeast growth – including respirative and fermentative metabolism and the effect of dissolved oxygen – is formed based on literature. For scale-up studies, the growth model is used along with one dimensional reactor model that accounts for liquid mixing, gas phase dynamics and local gas hold-up and mass transfer coefficient.By using a realistic growth model along with the reactor model, the simulated effects of scale-up are presented in terms of cell yield. A decrease in yield is noticed due to oxygen depletion in gas and insufficient liquid mixing. Potential improvements are related to the gas handling capacity and liquid mixing of the reactor.",

Over 99% of these impurities were removed by adsorption and ion exchange chromatography, followed by enzymatic isomerisation where glucose was converted to reach 50% of fructose content. Pilot scale downstream processing was successfully conducted with more than 89% of sugars recovered from the hydrolysate. Mass balance analysis indicated an overall conversion yield of 0.08 kg HFS per kg of mixed F&B waste and meanwhile the HFS also conforms to industrial standards. This proposed process is believed to promote the development of a circular economy by recycling F&B waste as a renewable resource for HFS production.",

Additionally, the final product produced by USFD and the powder produced by conventional freeze drying (CFD) were compared in terms of relative activities and physical properties. The results showed that atomizing conditions affected the particle size and, hence the enzyme activity. The enzyme activity was enhanced by ultrasonic atomizing at all conditions while most of the activity loss occurred in the drying step. The USFD provided higher enzyme activity, smaller particle size, better particle morphology and better reconstitution properties than CFD, which are explained by the ultrasonic atomizing and accelerated freezing steps of USFD. Also, the USFD sample preserved its stability in tough conditions, such as extreme pH levels, high temperature and the presence of metal ions better than the CFD counterpart.",

Low-fat coatings containing 3, 6 or 9% w/w vegetable oil or microparticulate whey protein as fat replacer were studied alongside a full-fat fluid as control. Equilibrium moisture contents of dried films were measured at 25 °C and gave similar adsorption behaviour which could be modelled using the Guggenheim–Anderson–de Boer model. The fat replacer increased the viscosity of the coating fluids and all the formulations exhibited Quemada model behaviour, so that the thickness of layers obtained by dip coating could be predicted by a previously reported mechanistic mathematical model. The model gave good agreement with measured layer thicknesses, indicating that the model could be used to optimise a coating film. One full-fat and one low-fat formulation with identical coating capacities were subjected to sensory analysis testing by untrained consumers and the low-fat product was found to be acceptable.",

Convectional (F) freezing induced considerable texture modification and cell structure disruption, whereas cryogenic (N) freezing led to freeze cracking.

Freezing significantly increased the rate of moisture removal in the first stage of drying, and it shortened drying time by up to 43%. Convectional freezing combined with hot air drying at a low temperature (60 °C) induced minimal changes in the surface structure of dried samples and produced fruits whose overall appearance was similar to that of unprocessed berries. Cryogenic freezing combined with hot air convective drying contributed to the greatest changes in the properties of cranberries.

Total proteins, total sugars, total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity (AOC) and polyphenolic profile were determined in the crude extracts and CGA fractions. Highest recovery was obtained with the nonionic Tween 20 at CGA to feed volumetric ratio 5 (RE% = 64) whereas the cationic CTAB proved more efficient (RE% = 58) at the highest ratio studied here (ratio 11). Antioxidant capacity followed the same trend as the recovery of polyphenols and highest enrichment in antioxidant activity for each of the surfactants (1.5 for Tween 20 and 1.4 for CTAB) was obtained at those conditions that led to maximum recovery. Highest selectivity was obtained with CTAB. Electrostatic interactions drove the separation with the cationic surfactant whereas with Tween 20 hydrophobic interactions were predominant. Polyphenolic profile of feed and CGAs fractions comprised mainly mono and dicaffeoylquinic acids and a small proportion of flavones. In most of the cases no enrichment of any particular polyphenol was found in CGAs samples. However, with Tween and at ratios 5 and 11 CGAs were enriched in dicaffeoylquinic acid. Future research should focus on assessing if the surfactant could also offer any advantage to the formulation of these polyphenols.",

However, this work mainly focuses on biotechnological processing of SCG hydrolysates and the reason why the fermentable sugars present in SCG hydrolysates cannot support sufficiently the growth of bacteria or yeasts. The reason is basically the presence of toxic co-contaminants, which have antibacterial properties. One suggestion for how to lower the presence of such co-contaminants in SCG hydrolysates is pre-extraction of them or the inclusion of a detoxification step. This review suggests that the fractionation of SCGs and detoxification of SCG hydrolysates might contribute to increased multiple utilization of this waste in many industrial sectors.",

     "abstract": "Different wastes treated together can be the supplement of nutritional deficiencies for the microorganisms involved in anaerobic codigestion (AcoD). In this study, the presence of macromolecules and trace elements on AcoD of agricultural waste was assessed. An extra nutrients solution that plays a key role in the microbiological metabolism was used at three different conditions: mesophilic (35 °C), intermediate (42 °C) and thermophilic (55 °C). The main results showed that at 35 °C in the presence of nutrients, biogas production reached 1.5-fold the production of biogas without them. Additionally, productivity was 1.9 times higher than that for the process without nutrients.Also, 42 °C without nutrients posed an interesting approach due to the uncommon use of this intermediate temperature, which has been demonstrated to be worth considering (55% of VS removal and 7.4 L-biogas). The AcoD at 55 °C showed that biogas production also surpassed 10.2 L with nutrients and that mL-CH4/g-VS were 1.2-fold of that obtained for the process without extra solution. Results for each temperature indicate that the nutrients solution contributes to AcoD. Furthermore, 35 °C, the most widespread temperature range at industrial scale, was the temperature at which the impact of nutrients was more remarkable. A deeper knowledge of AD nutritional limitations according to temperatures can optimize the industrial process in order to get better biogas yields and biomass removal.",

The produced microcapsules were analyzed by encapsulation efficiency and load, morphology, FTIR and release kinetics. Turbidity measurements and coacervation yield data showed that at pH 4.0 and CSM/caseinate volume ratio of 1:2, the maximum interactions between biopolymers were occurred. FTIR analysis demonstrated that under isoelectric pH of sodium caseinate due to presence of oppositely charged groups, electrostatic interactions between biopolymers might take place. SEM images showed that freeze-dried microcapsules had an irregular network with porous structure while spray-dried microcapsules possessed spherical shape. Release behavior of CUR was investigated in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids and mathematically modeled. The main release mechanisms of CUR were considered as Fickian diffusion and case-II transport in gastric and intestinal fluids, respectively. Finally, the results of this study showed the developed novel carriers had high potential for encapsulation and controlled release of hydrophobic food bioactives.",

In this study, catalytic hydrolysis of eucalyptus chips with solid sulfonated carbon-based catalysts prepared from three different carbon precursors (sucrose, glucose, and xylose) was studied under hot-compressed water at 150–250 °C with reaction time of 1–10 min. Increasing temperature up to 200 °C led to higher sugar yields from cellulose and hemicellulose while further increase in temperature caused higher formation of sugar degradation by-products. Sulfonated-sucrose (SO3H-Suc) showed the greatest performance on sugar production compared to other catalysts with less formation of furans and anhydroglucose; its high catalytic activity was related to its high acid site density as proven by NH3-TPD measurement. Size reduction and chemical pretreatment of the biomass were found to enhance the hydrolysis yield and reaction selectivity. The highest sugar yield of 40.7% comprising glucose, fructose, and xylose was achieved using 5% (w/w) SO3H-Suc at 200 °C for 5 min with milled biomass (60–100 μm) pretreated by alkaline oxidation.

Maximum activity for the immobilized invertase was at 50.8 °C (5.8 °C higher than the soluble invertase) and at pH 5.0 (similar to the soluble invertase). The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of invertase did reduce approximately tenfold after immobilization, probably due to diffusional delays. The immobilized invertase could be recycled tenfold in 4 h-batches of hydrolysis of sucrose at 40 °C and pH 6.0, maintaining the reaction conversion above 75%. The hydrolysis of sucrose catalyzed by immobilized invertase showed to be economically feasible in an operational window built based on economic metrics for a fed-batch process, with three intermittent feeds of sucrose to restore the substrate concentration at 100 g L−1 when the conversion reaches 95%. This work represents an advance in the field, because using a carrier-free and recyclable biocatalyst the specific productivity (gram of products per gram of biocatalyst per hour) of invert sugar was as high as those previously reported for invertase immobilized on solid carriers, which may dilute its volumetric activity and increase the cost of the biocatalyst.",

The effects of both ultrasonic time and maceration conditions including pH medium, ethanol/water mixture, temperature and nature of particles (square and ground) were evaluated. Among the examined parts, the peels were found to be rich in anthocyanins. The obtained results showed that the most efficient factors for the extraction of polyphenols are pH medium, nature of particles and temperature. It was found that a temperature of 75 °C and pH 2.0 were the best values to achieve high yield of polyphenols from the ground peels treated for 60 min. Under these optimal conditions, the total yield of phenolic compounds was 23.101 mg GAE/g DM. However, an ultrasonic time of 30 min produced 29.011 mg GAE/g DM in square peel extracts using acidified water as solvent. Further, in terms of total phenolic content, both colorimetric and HPLC analyses confirmed the beneficial effects of the increase of ultrasonic time on the yield of anthocyanins from square peels. In addition, five anthocyanins extracted from eggplant peels were identified as delphinidin-3-rutinoside, delphinidin-3-rutinoside-5-glucoside, petunidin-3-rutinoside, where malvidin-3-rutinoside-5-glucoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside were detected for the first time in eggplant peel extracts. Microscopic evaluation proved that ultrasonic processing and its contact time have significant effects on the structure changes, which caused damage in cells for pretreated samples in comparison with untreated ones. These results indicated that suitable ultrasonic pretreatment, can reduce the extraction time with high yield of phenolic compounds.",

Electrodialysis (ED) is an electrochemical non-solvent based separation process that can selectively separate ionic species from aqueous solutions through the use of ion selective membranes and electric field potential. Two ED cell configurations at three constant applied potentials (5, 10, and 15 V) were tested for removal and recovery of HAc from a model solution of corn stover hydrolysate. The uses of bipolar membrane (configuration 1) and cation-exchange membrane (configuration 2) in an ED stack demonstrated significantly different effects on system performance in terms of: demineralization rate, acetic acid removal rate, current efficiency, and energy consumption. The demineralization and mineralization of feed and recovery solutions, respectively, increased with increasing applied voltage for both configurations. Configuration 1 showed 1.5–2 times higher initial electrical resistance at lower applied voltages compared to configuration 2. The HAc flux and removal rate increased with increasing electric potential, and were significantly higher in configurations 2 than 1. The present work indicates that a cation exchange membrane operating at 10 V is optimal for recovering HAc from a model corn stover hydrolysate solution.",

Ultrasonication as a standalone technique resulted in lower polyphenols yields. Whereas ultrasonication when combined with conventional shaking extractions and carried out under conditions of 45 °C and 40:1 aqueous ethanolic solvent demonstrated higher yields of 2079.33 mg/100 g of dry grape pomace. The predictive yield as per statistical analysis was 2081.66 mg/100 g revealing a close agreement between experimental and theoretical values. Kinetic studies further showed that ultrasonication with subsequent shaking resulted in relatively lower activation energy causing greater and faster diffusion of the polyphenols into the solvent matrix. The outcome of this study reveals that grape pomace has significant antioxidant components like polyphenols; but maximum extraction yields involving lesser energy and time requires the involvement of a shorter ultrasonication in combination with conventional shaking extractions under optimized process control.",

Gas was introduced through a sintered porous metal tube at 0, 10 and 30 mL min−1 flow rates in a custom-built double jacketed glass crystalliser at 20 °C. Low power ultrasound (US; 205 kHz) was applied (0, 2 or 120 min) through a metal transducer flanged beneath the crystalliser after gassing. The whole solution was mechanically agitated at 200 rpm for 120 min at 15 °C. Recovered and dried lactose crystals were then analysed. Addition of gas alone or in combination with sonication enhanced the lactose yield due to acceleration of crystal nucleation and reduction of crystal size. The results showed that higher amounts of gas decreased lactose crystal size and due to the differences in solubility of gases, the effect on particle size, d(0.5), was more pronounced with CO2 (∼92 μm) than N2 (∼170 μm) as compared to without gas (∼178 μm). In general, the particle densities were unaffected by gas addition and similar flow behaviour indices among crystals were noted regardless of treatments.",

It is an alternative method that avoids the use of solvents for plant biomass sample pretreatment unlike those in the conventional microwave methods. SSMD method is preferred since the heating and the vaporization of the intracellular moisture within the plant biomass is able to create sufficient pressure to disrupt the biomass microstructure. In this work, the superiority of the SSMD method was validated using the bioactive extraction from Orthosiphon stamineus (Java tea) leaves. First, the degree of disruption of SSMD method under the effects of microwave power and heating time were investigated at various up-scaled conditions based on the structural analysis of the treated sample, and the extraction yields of the bioactive compounds after soaking and elution with a suitable solvent at room conditions. The results show that the SSMD-elution method gave a better extraction yield (4.65 ± 0.08 mg/g), which is comparable to that of microwave-assisted extraction (4.45 ± 0.03 mg/g) and ultrasonic-assisted extraction (4.18 ± 0.02 mg/g).

An extraction yield of 91.5% w/w was achieved only with 5 mM pyrophosphate and 80 min of ultrasonication. The physiological properties of extracted proteins were assessed by measuring Na2+- and Ca2+-ATPase activities, and digestion properties were examined using pepsin. Ultrasonic treatment in sodium pyrophosphate enhanced the extraction of proteins and digestibility by promoting the structural collapse of the myocardium. Accordingly, the developed extraction method can be used to recover proteins from the porcine myocardium and may contribute for the posterior application of this meat by-product in a nutritional supplement.",

As the moisture content within a compost pile and the air flow through it are the two crucial factors in the degradation process, we use a model which incorporates four mass-balance equations, namely, energy, oxygen, vapour and liquid water concentrations, to investigate the behaviour of a compost pile when these two factors interact. Analyses of different initial water contents and air-flow velocities within a compost pile show that they can determine the efficiency of the biodegradation process. For an intermediate water content range and air-flow rate, the biological reaction is shown to be at its optimal value but there is also a possibility of spontaneous ignition within the compost pile.",

The improvement of UAE was investigated by combining pre-leaching stage (PLS) with optimized UAE conditions (PLS-UAE). Spectrophotometric methods and HPLC analysis results revealed that the bioactive phenolic compounds increased using PLS-UAE, where gallic acid had the highest concentration (123.15 ± 0.34 mg g−1).

Protein removal is typically achieved by batch treatment with bentonite, however considerable costs ($0.5–1.0 billion per annum worldwide) are experienced through product loss within the bentonite sediment. Continuous inline bentonite dosing followed by centrifugation is an alternative contacting approach, however previous attempts have resulted in significant carryover of bentonite into the clarified stream. This issue is addressed in the present work, whereby an 84% reduction in carryover was achieved by undertaking bentonite inline dosing in conjunction the simultaneous centrifugal removal of yeast lees following primary alcoholic fermentation. Economic modelling suggests the cost of wine losses associated with bentonite treatment may be decreased by up to 82.5% using this protocol, representing significant opportunity to reduce processing costs of industrial-scale wine production.",

     "abstract": "Expelling and hexane extraction are two typical processes for soybean oil production used in industry. The main issues for these two processes are the low efficiency and hazardous chemical problems respectively. Enzyme assisted aqueous extraction process (EAEP) was proposed to increase the efficiency without using organic solvent, which is replaced by water. The environmental impact analysis of these three processes are based on their mass flows, energy consumption and global warming potential. For mass flows, the environmental impact indices were calculated based on material flow of input and output components. Energy consumption was used to evaluate the carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gas (GHG), and criteria pollutants emissions by GREET models. According to our results, hexane extraction has the highest environmental impact due to the application of organic solvent. Expelling has the highest GHG and criteria pollutants emissions because of the high energy requirement for heat pressing processes. EAEP has similar environmental impacts to the expelling process, but it also lowers GHG and criteria pollutants emissions. EAEP has the potential to be a green process adopted by industry although a high energy intense pretreatment to produce finer soybean flakes for increasing oil recovery is still a challenge.",

In the present study, we developed an efficient extraction method called ultrasound-negative pressure cavitation extraction (U-NPCE) for extraction of bioactive compounds from blueberry leaves. The optimization of the extraction process was based on single factor experiments and Box–Behnken design (BBD). The optimal extraction conditions were ethanol concentration (v/v) 68.61%, ultrasonic power 0.36 W/cm2, negative pressure −0.07 Pa, extraction time 15 min, solid/liquid ratio 1:30 g/mL and extraction temperature 50 °C. Under the optimal extraction condition, the mass transfer kinetics model indicated that U-NPCE has higher extraction yields for total phenols (TP), total flavonoids (TF) and total procyanidins (TPA) and the time consumption were 3.33 and 3.67 times shorter than that of ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and negative pressure cavitation extraction (NPCE) respectively. Moreover, extracts of U-NPCE (22.5 μg/mL) have stronger DPPH radical scavenging activity than those of UAE (30 μg/mL) and NPCE (32.5 μg/mL). The results indicated that U-NPCE was more efficient than UAE and NPCE for extraction of polyphenols from blueberry leaves and extracts has much higher TP, TF and TPA contents and DPPH radical scavenging activity.",

Forasteiro). A combined approach is used, including the analysis of the bean physical characteristics, the determination of the bean sorption isotherms, the realization of drying experiments in a convective dryer (for different operating conditions) and the development of a mathematical model, based on the different transport (heat and mass) phenomena involved inside and outside the beans during their drying. The results show that the drying of an Amazonian cocoa bean can be divided in two phases. It is demonstrated that this is due to the combination of two elements. First, the initial volumetric concentration of water is higher in the shell than in the core of the bean. Second, at the beginning of the drying, the drying rate is controlled by both internal and external transport phenomena while, in the second part of the drying (for moisture content of the bean below 0.5 kg of water/kg of dry matter), it is totally controlled by the water diffusion inside the bean. The model is compared to the experimental results in order to characterize the effective diffusion coefficient of water inside a bean. It is shown that this diffusion coefficient approximately doubles when the temperature is increased from 30 to 60 °C. It is close to 1.5 × 10−10 m2/s at 60 °C. Finally, measuring the polyphenol content of the dry beans allows assessing that, regarding chocolate quality, the fermented Amazonian cocoa beans should be dried at 30–40 °C.",

The USMVF was carried out by the combination of ultrasound and microwave in the vacuum frying to shorten the frying time and improve the quality of products. Two frying temperatures (90 °C and 100 °C) were comparatively analyzed both in USMVF and microwave-assisted vacuum frying (MVF). Based on the analysis of drying kinetics and quality assessment, the USMVF markedly increased the moisture evaporation kinetics and effective moisture diffusivity, reducing 20–28% of the drying time compared with the MVF, especially at lower frying temperature. The oil uptake of fried potato chips was reduced in the USMVF with low frying temperature. The texture properties (crispness) and color of fried potato chips were greatly improved by the combination of ultrasound in MVF. The energy consumption in USMVF was also decreased compared to that in MVF, decreasing 20.4–24.7% depending on the frying temperature in this test. A more porous microstructure in USMVF samples was observed by SEM and helped to explain the effects of ultrasound.

A proper adsorbent concentration was proposed in order to achieve the desired clarification without reducing total polyphenolic compounds (TPC) to a large extent. All adsorbents were efficient in reducing total solids and lipids from pequi extract, but chitosan presented outstanding performance for lipid removal.

The co-presence of organic acids (2.2 g/L acetic, 1.8 g/L lactic and 0.6 g/L formic) showed a synergistic positive effect that can counteract the inhibitory character of phenolics.

This means that the inhibitory effect of phenolic compounds on ABE production with Clostridium beijerinckii could be overcome by the presence of organic acids at low concentration in fermentation media.The results were confirmed by using a substrate of molasses. Better fermentation was achieved with beet molasses due to the lower concentration of phenolics, especially catechin.

The aw modulation was carried out using two ligands (glucose and sodium chloride) whilst viscosity was changed by adding a thickener (maltodextrin, DE 8.7).The change of “reduced viscosity” due to the addition of substrate, ligands and/or maltodextrin indicated interactions of ligands and thickeners with pectin and among themselves.In ternary systems, the aw reduction was the most important factor in the inhibition of PME activity whilst the viscosity increase was less effective.In quaternary systems, at equal aw values, the increase of viscosity upon maltodextrin addition generally determined an enhancement of the PME activity ascribable to the increase of the “reduced viscosity”. On the basis of the excluded volume theory, this increase determined a crowding effect that positively affects the enzymatic activity. Viscosity and aw being equal, PME activity was lower in glucose ternary solution than in sodium chloride–maltodextrin quaternary solution despite the lower T’g of the former; this likely due to molecular crowding.The results obtained in this study widen previous knowledge on the effect of aw, viscosity and T’g on the enzymatic activity, highlighting that the relative importance of these factors can largely depend on the type of enzyme, the nature of the components in the system, and their interactions, which, in turn, can increase the enzymatic activity due to macromolecular crowding.",

It is therefore important to understand how this variability impacts on the downstream separation processes.Exploring all potential sources of variability is challenging due to resource and time constraints, however, the use of targeted mathematical modelling can significantly reduce the need for expensive and time consuming experimentation. In this work, we present a dynamic equilibrium stage process model, and a methodology for prediction of key process parameters from limited experiments, capable of describing ATPE separations under both multi-cycle batch and continuous counter-current modes of operation. The capabilities of the proposed methodology are demonstrated using a case study separation of the enzyme α-amylase from impurities in a PEG 4000–phosphate aqueous two phase system (ATPS) containing NaCl. The model can be used to predict the separation performance of the process, as well as for the investigation of suitable design and operating conditions.",

The model was verified and validated using an industrial spray dryer in food drying processes covering a wide range of operating conditions and food products. The model was further extended so that the scientist could estimate not only key operating parameters such as feed flow rate or drying gas outlet temperature but also final particle size and drying kinetics for a better understanding of the drying phenomenon by spray drying. From the comparison of the experimental and the estimated results it is concluded that the model successfully describes all spray drying operations independently of the product nature. Raw material and laboratory time can be reduced by replacing the traditional trial and error methodologies by using the developed tool.

The Baranyi and the ‘Logistic with Breaking Delay’ models were applied for biofilms grown in various laboratory and pilot-plant devices, including pipes or mock-ups mimicking vegetables washing tanks in the fresh-cut food industry. An initial short transitional period not described by the growth models was observed during which cells rapidly attached to pilot-plant devices’ surfaces. The following observed surface contamination growth patterns were consistent with both growth models. However, only the Baranyi model was relevant to the occurrence of wide variability and/or growth curves with no lag or stationary phases. Both surface design and hydrodynamics in pilot-plant devices strongly influenced biofilm growth curves. Based on fitted parameters, it was possible to differentiate between areas and relate these to design parameters such as sharp corners, welds or specific hydrodynamics as 2D, 3D or near-static flow conditions. 15–25 h lag phases reflecting equilibrium between cell attachment and release were observed for wall shear stresses exceeding 0.5 Pa under dynamic flow conditions. Consequently, flow pattern design improvements by increasing the shear rate would greatly reduce food cross-contamination risk, as cleaning operations could start before any significant biofilm developments.",

Measurement of particle size and turbidity, in combination with analyses of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), circular dichroism (CD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fluorescence spectroscopy, and atomic force microscope (AFM) were performed to characterize Z–S composite nanoparticles. Results showed that hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic attraction were involved in the interactions between zein and shellac, leading to the changes in secondary structure and thermal stability of zein. At low levels of shellac (Z:S, from 50:1 to 2.5:1), a compact structure of Z–S composite nanoparticles was formed, which had smaller particle sizes, higher turbidity value and better thermal stability. At high levels of shellac (Z:S, from 2.5:1 to 1:2.5), a cross-linked structure of Z–S composite nanoparticles was generated, which exhibited larger particle sizes, lower turbidity value, and poorer thermal stability. The potential mechanism of a two-step process was proposed to explain the formation of Z–S composite nanoparticles. Findings in the present work will help further understand the interaction between alcohol-soluble biopolymers (e.g. zein and shellac) and provide a new insight into the development of potential carriers for bioactive compounds.",

The cells were easily recovered from the cell suspension and the time required for complete sedimentation was found to be independent of tube size or design. Cell damage was observed once the cells were sedimented, therefore this process depends on both the residence time of the cells in the pellet and on the acceleration applied. The sensitivity of the cells to this operation was higher than for other naked microalgae or for very sensitive red blood cells. Indeed, excessive treatment produced cell damage that reduced the productivity of subsequent cultures. CFD simulations were carried out in 2D and a good agreement was found between the CFD and experimental values in terms of the time required for full sedimentation.

Medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCTs) induce the residual glyceride lipolysis, which improve fat absorption, and thus reduce its deposition in infants. Medium- and long-chain triacylglycerols (MLCTs)-rich structured lipids (SLs) combine these benefits, and they can be delivered to infants in an easy way. In this study, MLCTs-rich SLs were synthesized by lipase-catalyzed interesterification of ARASCO with MCTs in a solvent-free system. Four commercial immobilized lipases from different sources were compared for their efficiency in the production of MLCTs yield. The results indicated that the highest yield of MLCTs was achieved by Lipozyme 435 from Candida antarctica as a biocatalyst. The best reaction conditions were as follows; enzyme load 8% (w/w), reaction temperature 90 °C, reaction time of 3 h, and substrates mole ratio 1:1. Under these conditions, MLCTs were obtained in a yield of 53.75%. Thermoprofile displayed that the MLCTs-rich SLs melted below body temperature of 37 °C. The obtained MLCTs-rich SLs can be suggested as a nutritional and functional fat analogue with potential applications in infant formula industry.",

The essential oil obtained by HD presented a high content of sesquiterpenes, mainly β-elemene (BE) and bicyclogermacrene (BG).

Chemical analysis of the SFE extracts collected at 50–80 min of processing time showed 62% of BE and 38% of BG for the volatile fraction, representing 100% of major compounds content. The highest antioxidant activity was detected in the Soxhlet extracts (99%), followed by the supercritical products (94%) and, finally, the essential oil (6%).

Because of the relatively high temperature, UHT processes are known for developing severe foulants on heat exchange surfaces. Furthermore, there is ambiguity (and commercial variation) in the exact process temperature when UHT processing. Therefore, it was the goal of this research to quantify the effects of process temperature changes on fouling rates in a pilot UHT system. The research performed evaluated fouling when processing 20% (wt./wt.) reconstituted non-fat dry milk as a model high protein beverage. The variables of interest were process temperature (127, 132 and 138 °C) and run time. Each thermal process was designed to maintain equivalent thermal processing of a model microbe (F0 = 7.5) by adjusting the hold tube length at each temperature. After a defined run time, foulant from the pilot system was extracted into a sodium hydroxide solution. Compositional changes in this solution were indirectly associated with the pickup of foulant from the pilot system. Statistical differences (α = 0.05) in fouling rates were observes as a function of process temperature using 4 foulant indicators (active alkali, electrical conductivity, protein content and color). The temperature dependence of fouling rate fit significantly to Arrhenius models (r2 range 0.95–0.99) with activation energies ranging from 116.6 to 154.5 kJ mol−1. Results provide evidence that reduction in process temperatures can significantly decrease fouling rates, therefore increasing product run times.",

In this work, a small-scale double drum dryer (20 cm length × 15 cm diameter) was interfaced with a 98.3 m2 External Compound Parabolic Concentrator (XCPC) [solar thermal collector] array designed to produce up to approximately 40 kW of heating power.

The design had 4 variables: added water, added maltodextrin carrier, dwell time, and drum surface temperature. Moisture content, aw, and color of the dried pomaces were assessed to determine the effectiveness of the drying. Both pomaces were rendered shelf-stable (aw < 0.6) for all tested conditions. However, prune pomace exhibited a narrower range of aw values than did tomato pomace.

Moreover, the proliferative effects of CN-IMOs, purified CN-IMOs (CN-IMOs-P), and commercial isomalto-oligosaccharides (IMOs-50) on Lactobacillus were observed in vitro. CN-IMOs-P was the best effective carbon source for Lactobacillus growth at an optimal dosage of 2.0% in the medium. All the results showed that Chinese chestnut could be a potential raw material for IMOs production, which was a new further processing area of chestnut utilization, and CN-IMOs-P can be explored as a novel prebiotic healthcare product for human gastrointestinal health.",

Crossflow filtration was shown to be a feasible method for concentrating the polyphenols present in dilute aqueous solutions. High-performance liquid chromatography was employed for the determination of total anthocyanins, total flavonols and chlorogenic acid in the hot water extract. Both nanofiltration membranes (NF245 and NF270) showed complete rejection of phenolic compounds at good permeances, whereas crossflow mode of filtration was found to reduce membrane fouling considerably. Furthermore, a suitable protocol was developed for clean-in-place of the used membranes. After repeated filtrations followed by the cleaning protocol, the rejection performance was preserved unaltered and the relative permeance was recovered up to 73% for NF245 membrane and more than 99% for NF270 membrane.",

An optimum production scale was then determined from the simulation study and subjected to sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify seven parameters that would affect the profitability of the process.

Grape berries were sorted based on their density by floating them in sodium chloride solutions of various concentrations, corresponding to densities of 1081, 1088, 1094, 1100, 1107, and 1115 kg/m3. Class samples were selected for determination of soluble solids, pH and titrable acid, total phenols, T1 and T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and drying kinetics. The resulting dried raisins were characterised by browning index (BI) and texture. Results revealed that with increasing grape ripeness, the total phenol concentration, soluble solid content and pH all increased significantly while the titratable acidity content decreased (p < 0.05). The drying rate and moisture effective diffusivity dramatically also increased with increasing ripeness. MRI analysis indicated that with increasing ripeness the free water content of grape increases significantly and the bound water distribution decreases, which explains why the samples with higher ripeness dried at faster rates. The ripest berries, of density greater than 1100 kg/m3, were found to be better suited for raisin processing taking account of drying time, the browning index (BI) and the texture profile of the raisins. The findings indicate that classification of grapes according to ripeness prior to drying is necessary for more effective and high-quality raisin processing.",

We propose an approach where mathematical models are used to assist the miller in determining the required operating conditions. The basic idea we explore is to move most of the experimentation from the industrial-scale equipment to a small-scale one where data can be obtained more quickly and at an inferior cost. The operation of an industrial roller mill, whose milling gap is the operating variable to be determined, is used as a test bed to assess the feasibility of the proposed methodology. An extended set of data deriving from experimentation in a small-scale mill are used jointly with a dataset from the industrial mill to design a multivariate statistical model based on latent variables, which is then inverted to find the desired operating conditions. The results show that the proposed approach is viable and is particularly effective when the industrial-scale dataset is limited. It is also shown that near infrared spectra can be effectively used to characterize the wheat feed.",

The important factors influencing the filtration rate and product quality are type of feed solution (type of fruit juice), membrane selection and operating parameters (temperature, transmembrane pressure, cross-flow velocity and volume concentration ratio). According to physicochemical and sensory tests confirmed by many types of research, juices produced by membrane filtration are of an excellent quality. Membrane fouling is a critical issue and inhibits the wider application of membranes in the fruit juice industry. The use of cross-flow filtration is one of the main requirements for increasing permeate flux, but overall insufficient, so we considered various techniques (enzymatic pretreatment, mechanical and electrical techniques) for improving fruit juice flux during membrane clarification.",

In this work, a microwave pretreatment is proposed as an easy scale-up alternative for grape pomace polyphenol extraction, especially for anthocyanins. The double effect of this pretreatment on extraction yield and on product richness is assessed. Microwaves accelerate the extraction kinetics of most compounds, but their effect on polyphenols is more pronounced than in other substances (like sugars and fibres). These differentiated rates are exploited to improve the polyphenol richness of the final dry product. By selecting the appropriate operating conditions, polyphenol yield was increased by 57% and, simultaneously, dry product richness was enhanced by 32%. Also, anthocyanin extraction boost was remarkable. Its content in the final dry product was 85% higher than the one obtained without the microwave pretreatment. The cellular bioactivity of these extracts was improved by 83% and 133%.",

In addition, NCs when exposed to UV–vis light treatment had higher activation energy and lower constant rate (k) than EE. In conclusion, nanoencapsulation offers greater stability to the β-carotene, α-carotene, and lutein upon exposure to conditions similar to those used in the food processing (heat) and storage (UV–vis light).",

     "abstract": "Preparation of protein hydrolysates for food use requires the elimination of residual enzyme activity after the hydrolysis reaction, which is usually achieved by thermal inactivation. However, precise data on inactivation of commonly used enzymes is still not readily available. Sodium-caseinate hydrolysates were produced with the commercial protease Protamex™. A conventional thermal method to terminate enzymatic hydrolysis was evaluated and complete inactivation of Protamex™ was attained at 95 °C for 20 s. High intensity light pulses (HILP), Pulsed Electric Fields (PEF), and ultrasound (US) were evaluated as methods to terminate enzymatic hydrolysis. HILP was effective in inactivating Protamex™ in solutions with high optical transmittance particularly in the UV region. A 90% reduction in Protamex™ activity was achieved after a 1 min treatment with no significant temperature increase. A PEF treatment (18.2 kV/cm, 500 pulses) gave a 70% decrease in Protamex™ activity in a hydrolysate solution while sample temperatures remained below the range for thermal inactivation. Thermosonication did not decrease enzyme activity at temperatures <60 °C and at temperatures >60 °C any inactivation observed was most likely due to thermal effects. Despite the promising results, further optimisation would be required before these technologies could be considered as alternatives to conventional heat treatments.",

To this aim, final permeate volume, membrane and fouling resistances and individual protein concentration were analyzed. At the end of each individual study, the membranes were characterized by liquid–liquid displacement porosimetry. As a result, 50 °C was found to be the most appropriated temperature due to its higher capability to restore the initial membrane resistance and the higher efficiency achieved in terms of protein separation. Both conditions fulfilled without altering the structural properties of the membrane as given by porosimetric analysis. In contrast, a great fouling resistance involving null protein transmission occurred when cleaning was performed at 60 °C.",

Toasted and native soy flour, the major food ingredients in bread and bakery industries, can be disinfested prior to use through electron beam. However, this can induce changes in the nutritional and functional properties, which can ultimately affect the quality and the nutritional value of the final products. In the present study, toasted and native soy flour were submitted to electron beam (EB) irradiation at 4.8, 9.2, 15.3 and 21.2 kGy; and assessed for water absorption capacity (WAC), protein dispersibility index (PDI), protein solubility, trypsin inhibitor (TI) content, isoflavones content, in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD), glycinin (11S) to β-conglycinin (7S) ratio, and lipoxygenase. WAC declined slightly (P < 0.05) in toasted soy flour, but increased significantly (P < 0.05) at low doses in native soy flour. In both toasted and native soy flour, slight decline was noted in protein solubility while TI and lipoxygenase declined significantly (P < 0.05). However, the decline noted in TI content was not proportionate to the increase in IVPD. PDI remained unchanged in toasted soy flour but declined significantly (P < 0.05) in native soy flour. 11S to 7S ratio increased significantly (P < 0.05) in toasted flour at all the doses. In general, significant (P < 0.05) decline in isoflavones was noted in both toasted and native soy flour. In conclusion, the results showed that EB-irradiation could induce desirable changes in the nutritional/functional properties of toasted and native soy flour, though at the expense of some of the physical properties.",

Potato cubes were dehydrated with four types of treatments: static osmotic dehydration, osmotic dehydration with agitation, osmotic dehydration with ultrasound application, and osmotic dehydration with ultrasound pretreatment. Sodium chloride and maltodextrin (12 DE) were used as osmotic agents. For each treatment, various variables were examined for their effect on water loss and solid gain. A microscopic analysis was carried out to evaluate the formation of microchannels and other changes to the potato tissue structure. The effective diffusivity was determined using the analytical solution of the Fick’s second law taking into account the potato shrinkage. Ultrasound treatment resulted in higher moisture and solid mass transfer due to the breaking of cell structure as revealed by microstructure examination. At solute concentration of 30%, ultrasound-assisted osmotic dehydration enhanced the effective diffusivity of water by about 5.5–260%, whereas the ultrasound pretreatment in water increased the diffusivity during osmotic dehydration at solute concentration of 70% up to 130%.",

     "abstract": "Mechanical grinding of tea is a crucial step in tea processing which can influence the quality and utilization of tea products. To investigate the effects of different grinding scale on black tea, particles at organ (∼mm), tissue (500–100 μm), and cell (50–10 μm) scales, were produced to compare their microstructural, compositional, molecular, antioxidant and dynamic extraction properties. The results proved organ and tissue-scale particles had similar properties, whereas cell-scale particles were significantly altered. In detail, for particles, the decrease in particle size resulted in an increase in cell wall breakage ratio, specific surface area, exposure of inner pores and depolymerized cell wall components on particle surfaces. According to the results of dynamic extraction, extraction equilibrium of the components could be obtained within 45 min. For water extracts at extraction equilibrium, microstructural changes at cell scale affected the diffusion process of phytochemicals, leading to more extractable macromolecules (protein and polysaccharide) and homogeneous particles, which enhanced antioxidant activity. However, the infusion yields of cytoplasmic micromolecules (tea polyphenols, caffeine, and free sugars) were not influenced by different grinding process. In conclusion, organ-scale grinding can meet the need for micromolecule-aimed products, while cell-scale grinding is essential for structure, macromolecule and antioxidation-enhanced products.",

Most of the studies focused on converting solid waste feedstock for value-added chemicals and fuels production. However, less effort has been devoted on liquid waste such as beverage waste which is a significant sewage stream in urban area. In this study, a bioconversion process was developed to produce low-cost fructose syrup using beverages waste as feedstock. The process composed of enzymatic hydrolysis, activated carbon treatment, ion exchange chromatography and ligand exchange chromatography. Beverages waste collected from local supermarket was treated by commercial pectinase and sucrase. Optimisation study on enzyme activities indicated that both enzymes were most active at 50 °C and pH of 4.0–4.5. Hydrolysate containing 36.0 g/L glucose and 45.0 g/L fructose was then de-colourised in the activated carbon treatment. Also, more than 98% ions were removed after the cation and anion exchange chromatography. Lastly, high fructose syrup was produced by ligand exchange chromatography at a fructose separation efficiency of 74.9%. A total of 47.5% sugars in the hydrolysate were recovered as high fructose syrup, while the remaining sugars were in the glucose-rich stream. The proposed method would be a green and sustainable process for nutrient recovery in beverage waste valorisation. Future study should focus on increasing fructose separation efficiency by using simulated moving bed system and the enhancement of fructose production yield by isomerisation of glucose-rich stream.",

Eight DESs were synthesized and applied, and ChCl-1,3-Butanediol exhibited the best extraction ability. Under the negative pressure of −0.07 pa, the influencing parameters, temperature, liquid–solid ratio, and extraction time, were optimized by response surface methodology (RSM).

After solubilisation at the defined optimum condition, precipitation was performed at different pH values (3–7). The best performance on the basis of protein recovery was found at pH 5.5. The optimum conditions for both solubilization and precipitation of rye flour proteins were applied to rye flours (R1, R1A and R1B) differing in their particle size. Flours R1A and R1B resulted from pulverizing flour R1 by a jet mill at a feed rate of 3.35 and 1.17 kg/h, respectively. In contradiction to the expected in terms of smaller particle size, greater protein recovery percentage was achieved for both R1 and R1B flours.

The results of testing of the machine using soya beans revealed that blending efficiency of 85.52% was obtained from combination of 3 blades assembly, basket with half angle of 30° and speed of 1400 rpm. The optimisation of the machine parameters using response surface methodology produced optimum paste expelling efficiency of 94.89% with desirability of 94.3% from combination of 3-blades assembly, basket of half angle of 50° and speed of 1400 rpm. The speed of rotation and basket angle has positive significant effects on the paste expelling efficiency while blade number has insignificant effect. Paste expelling efficiency increase with both increased in speed of rotation and basket angle. The machine capacity and cost of production are 100 L per hour and $ 1670 respectively.",

     "abstract": "Conventional thermal sterilization is the most commonly used technique to inactivate microbial spores in low acidic liquid food products. In recent years, food researchers have investigated ultrasonication in combination with heat as an alternate technology for the reduction of microbial spores. However, the competitive advantage of this process over conventional thermal sterilization has not been properly assessed. In this study, energy delivered by ultrasound was used to provide the heating needed, which fulfils 55% of the thermal energy requirement in addition to the effect caused by cavitation. The effect of pre-treatment with ultrasonication (20 kHz, 750 W) on decimal reduction time (D values) of Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) spores ATCC 6633 was evaluated in three different suspending media (water, whole milk and rice porridge) and were compared with thermal treatment. Among these, pre-treatment with ultrasonication (114 μm, 1.1 W/ml, 5 min) of whole milk resulted in 35% reduction in D-value compared to thermal only treatment at 100 °C whereas under the same treatment conditions, water and rice porridge gave only 18% and 4% reduction respectively. These reduction in D values through the use of combined technology is minimal unless excessive ultrasonication is used, which is commercially not viable.",

The pigments’ recovery from the extract was performed using 5 kDa and 10 kDa ultra-filtration membranes. Results showed that increasing the extraction temperature in the range of 40–60 °C was proportional to chlorophyll extraction efficiency, while the maximal carotenoid yield was achieved at 50 °C. Ultrasonic power (from 100 W to 300 W) facilitated the extraction of both chlorophylls and carotenoids. Results from ultra-filtration showed that most pigments (>90%) were available in permeate through 10 kDa membrane, while 5 kDa membrane partially retained the pigments. Filtration resistance was quantified with resistance-in-series’ model, showing that the cake layer was the most important fouling resistance during filtration. Threshold flux at different rotation speeds (200 and 600 rpm) was determined by trans-membrane pressure stepping tests, which were around 10 and 14.5 L/m2 h, respectively. Results from this study demonstrated the efficiency of the multistage process involving UAE and UF to enhance the recovery of pigments from brown seaweeds.",

We aimed at revealing the time-averaged and unsteady property of the turbulent swirling flow and its strengthened hydrodynamic impact on the internal pipe surface where cleaning takes place. We performed modelling based on Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS) and large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent swirl flows with different swirl intensities. The LES model presented a more vigorous and dynamic swirling flow than the RANS approach. The LES successfully identified four vortex core regions within and downstream of the swirl pipe which the RANS approach failed to capture. The RANS and LES results showed that, without the need of increasing the overall flow velocity, the four-lobed swirl pipe is able to increase not only the mean wall shear stress to the downstream but also the fluctuation rate of the wall shear stress especially in the locations further downstream of the swirl pipe where the four cortex cores have interacted and dissipated. As the increase of either the mean or the fluctuation rates of wall shear stress contribute to pipeline cleaning, the numerical work has demonstrated that, with the local introduction of the swirl pipe, the efficiency of CIP procedures in closed processing systems would be improved significantly thus reducing time and costs for the CIP process.",

These particles were ionically cross-linked, using the extrusion method, with magnesium acetate, calcium acetate and zinc acetate and were characterized, by FTIR and SEM, in terms of some physicochemical properties, morphology, stability in water, and water retention capacity. These properties are influenced by the composition of polysaccharide mixture, which determines the number of cross-linkable functional groups, and also by the type and the concentration of the cross-linking agent. Analysis, by scanning electron microscopy, reveals that the yeast cells are well immobilized and in high amounts in the polysaccharides matrix. This matrix maintains the cell viability at high levels in aqueous media. High fermentation yields were obtained and the specific productivity in ethanol was equal to 0.79 g ethanol/h × g yeast cells. Highest ethanol yield was obtained for the sample cross-linked with Mg2+, and the lowest for the sample cross-linked with Zn2+. Polysaccharides matrix provides structural stability to yeast cells and maintains the cells viability, at values higher than 82% even after 10 fermentation cycles, as well as their ability to proliferate. Moreover, the obtained particles are stable, can be readily recovered by filtration from the fermentation medium and can be reused for at least 10 fermentation cycles. The obtained bio-reactors could represent a new approach to solving the problem of producers in the alcoholic beverages industry concerning the deficit of mineral nutrients.",

Productivities in glucose, xylose, and mixed-sugar (glucose:xylose = 1:2) media were 2.23, 1.58, and 0.91 g L−1 h−1, respectively. These were almost two-fold more than use of a more common BD producer, albeit a pathogenic organism, Klebsiella oxytoca ATCC 8724. Fermentation efficiency in the biomass hydrolyzates with 40 g/L of total sugar was as efficient as synthetic sugar with a similar sugar concentration, but not so in the hydrolyzates with 80 g/L of total sugar. The optimum fed-batch process in a glucose medium produced 103 g/L BD in the final fermentation broth, with yield and productivity of 0.47 g/g and 0.81 g L−1 h−1, respectively. Our study concluded that an efficient BD fermentation is possible using a nonpathogenic culture in a single-sugar medium; however, appropriate biomass processing strategies must be developed to produce separate streams of glucose and xylose from lignocellulosic biomass for efficient BD production. We, therefore, proposed a novel biomass processing strategy using a three-step pretreatment process to obtain separate streams of biomass extractives, cellulose hydrolyzate, and hemicellulose hydrolyzate.

Our research goal was to characterize mass transfer and endogenous metabolic phenomena of the tissue to obtain minimally processed apples. The presence of CaLac and AA in solution affected the mass transfer of water and solutes, which was attributed to the changes in the cellular structure and thus to spaces available for solute transport. The metabolic heat production in samples treated in sucrose solutions was slightly lower than in untreated samples, and it was further reduced with CaLac addition. However, samples impregnated with AA exhibited a higher heat production due to a metabolic response of the tissue to AA treatment. When combined with CaLac, the heat production decreased to a level lower than untreated samples, except for those that were treated for 120 and 240 min (higher impregnation), achieving the highest heat production values. These results confirm previous findings, suggesting that AA solution can promote a stress response on specific fresh-cut vegetable tissues, as well as an increase of their endogenous metabolic activity, as confirmed by the higher O2 consumption observed with the head space gas determination.",

The new oven type was coated with a ceramic that increased the infrared radiation during the baking process. The baking process is therefore accelerated and the production parameters had to be adjusted once more. The process parameters proofing time and the baking temperature were optimized. The quality criterion was defined by the characteristics of bread rolls obtained from the conventional oven using the specific volume, the baking loss, the colour saturation, crumb firmness as well as the elasticity. The Nelder–Mead simplex method led within 11 experiments to an optimal baking result. The optimization was terminated when the values for the confidence interval of the objective function include zero. The optimal processing parameters for the bread rolls were a proofing time of 117 min and the baking temperature of 215 °C for 16 min. The simplex method according to Nelder–Mead lead to promising results for production parameters of bread rolls in a new oven system.",

However, a major limitation for the clinical application of quercetin is its low bioavailability, due to its low solubility in water. One way to increase the bioavailability of quercetin is to precipitate it in sub-micrometricscale, encapsulated by a surfactant material, using the Supercritical Fluid Extraction of Emulsions (SFEE) method. The objective of this work is to study the scale-up of a semi-continuous SFEE process for the production of microencapsulated quercetin. An experimental study of the encapsulation of quercetin in soy-bean lecithin–Pluronic L64®surfactants was performed in order to evaluate the variation of product characteristics with significant parameters, such as duration of SFEE, density of CO2 medium, used CO2/L of emulsion (kg/L), and thus determine the suitable conditions for scale-up. In addition, a themo-economic evaluation was done in order to identify bottlenecks during scale-up and promote solutions. According to the thermo-economic evaluation, the decrease of CO2 flow demonstrated to be the main parameter to decrease the energy demand and cost of manufacturing of the SFEE process. Thus further experimental studies should be done towards optimization of this parameter.",

Mathematical modelling can assist in more precisely zoning in quantitatively on the selection of design input variable values that can produce a best compromise between conflicting design output variables. Mathematical modelling can also highlight design sensitivities.

Five of the dye-Sepharose matrices showed over 90% adsorption of bovine lactoperoxidase directly from whey without any pretreatment using the batch mode, and were thus selected for further adsorption and elution studies.

Then, lactose and o-NPG were evaluated as substrates, and temperature and 1-butanol concentration were optimized using response surface methodology. Higher yields (ranging between 0.7 and 0.92 mol/mol) were obtained with o-NPG rather than lactose. However, under optimized conditions, a yield of 0.58 mol/mol was obtained with lactose as substrate, which is interesting because of being much cheaper than o-NPG. Three immobilization strategies were evaluated, the catalyst immobilized in glyoxyl-agarose being selected for producing a yield from lactose of 0.76 mol/mol. Catalyst reuse was evaluated in the synthesis of butyl-β-galactoside in consecutive batch mode during ten cycles of 2 h. Immobilization allowed an increase in the efficiency of catalyst use with respect to the soluble enzyme, the amount of product per unit mass of enzyme protein, being higher from the fifth batch on.

     "abstract": "Distiller’s dried grains with solubles (DDGS) is a coproduct of the corn-based ethanol industry and it is a good resource of protein and oil for animal feeds. High protein and oil content DDGS is desired because of its high nutrition and economic values. Physical separation is an easy approach to increase oil and fat content based on profiles of components. Protein and oil rich DDGS tends to exist in the finer particle; fibers rich DDGS is observed in large particle fraction. A primary sieving connected with aspiration fraction is used to condense protein and oil contents for DDGS. Particle size, air flowrate and different fractions derived by aspiration are independent variables. The proper combination and interaction of variables for protein and oil separation are higher flowrate, smaller particle sizes, and the heavy fraction. And, the best efficiency for protein and oil separation reaches about 29.7% and 68.15% respectively. For fiber separation, a mild condition results in higher fiber content approximately 7%. Additionally, the relationship between nutrient separation and independent variables can be expressed by a linear model. The combination of primary sieving and aspiration with specific air flowrate used in fractionation process can increase value to the corn-based ethanol industry.",

High solid concentrations resulted in high protein recovery, degree of hydrolysis (DH) and contents of reducing sugar and 5′-nucleotides (5′-GMP, 5′-IMP), which indicated a positive effect on the release of yeast intracellular substances. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed negligible difference in the molecular mass distribution of peptides. The micromorphology of the hydrolysed yeast cells was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Result demonstrated that high solid concentrations accelerated the plasmolysis, deformation and lysis of yeast cells. Similarly, addition of NaCl or commercial yeast extract to the yeast cell suspension (18% w/w) improved the DH. Therefore, high concentrations of NaCl or yeast cell hydrolysates in solutions with high solid concentrations could damage the yeast cell membrane, leading to effective contact between the enzyme and the substrate and consequent increase in the hydrolysis efficiency.

The approach was verified using a model system involving liquid diffusion (1% w/w ascorbic acid solution) into a porous solid matrix (apple cubes) under HPP conditions (100–600 MPa) with different holding times (0–30 min). The associated fluid diffusivity values ranged 4.38 × 10−9–2.19 × 10−8 m2 s−1. Finally, a simple linear model was fitted to the experimental data at 100 and 600 MPa which could be used to estimate the total porosity of the solid matrix. Thus, finite element numerical solutions combined with simple Fickian approach could be used to model the unsaturated liquid flow in to a porous solid matrix.

The process of wine fermentation is described by a modified version of the novel model including a death phase for yeast and the influence of oxygen on the process published in Borzì et al. (2014). This modification guarantees that nutrients can still be consumed in an anaerobic environment.

This lag phase has been studied mostly on a macroscopic level. However, a quest for more mechanistically-based predictive models has started, for example, through the integration of a metabolic reaction network into widely used macroscopic model structures. This multi-scale modeling approach is called dynamic metabolic flux analysis (dMFA). In this contribution, a recently developed algorithm for dMFA is used to estimate the metabolic fluxes in Escherichia coli K12 during an experimentally induced lag phase through a sudden shift in temperature. To study this phenomenon, controlled bioreactor experiments were performed: on the one hand at a fixed and optimal temperature for growth (37 °C), and on the other hand starting at 20 °C, with a sudden temperature shift to 37 °C during the exponential growth, inducing an intermediate lag phase. The evolution of biomass and metabolite concentrations was monitored during these experiments. After dMFA analysis of the gathered measurements, some interesting patterns in metabolic activity during the different growth phases are revealed. The described case study is a first practical test case to assess the capabilities of the recently developed dMFA methodology in an experimental predictive microbiology setting.",

     "abstract": "Ultrafiltration is a technique used for the separation and recovery of proteins according to their molecular weight. The efficiency of the process can be controlled by control of the operational parameters, which can affect the structure and functionality of proteins in the final product. The aim of this study was to evaluate how the ultrafiltration process using ceramic membranes affects the physicochemical and conformational characteristics of quinoa protein fractions at two pHs above the isoelectric point of quinoa protein extracts. The results showed differences in permeate flux, reaching a volume concentration factor of three at 600 min at pH 7.0 and 300 min at pH 9.5. Thus, pH was a very important factor to control flux and membrane fouling. Higher protein concentration in the concentrate were detected at pH 9.5 (10.4 ± 0.2 mg/mL), whereas at pH 7.0, only 7.7 ± 0.1 mg/mL of recovered protein was obtained. In addition, differences in quinoa zeta potential and amino acid composition were found for the two pHs. The ultrafiltration process considerably affected the spatial configuration of the protein at pH 7.0, with a structured α-helix for the concentrate. The concentrates showed lower denaturation enthalpy values than the initial and permeate fractions at both pHs, indicating greater structural modification as result of ultrafiltration. In conclusion, pH is a critical variable affecting the physicochemical and conformational characteristics of ultrafiltrated quinoa proteins. It is important to evaluate the impact of the changes from ultrafiltration on functional properties for the development of novel food ingredients.",

A subset of the results shows good agreement with new and previously published experimental data. A new analysis is presented for calculating the shape of the region cleared of soil by the point of jet impact moving around, or up and down a surface, which allows the resources (time, liquid, and energy) required to clean a cylindrical vessel to be estimated. Selected jet paths and nozzle motion patterns are compared in a case study which illustrates the potential for designing a cleaning programme.

Non-pressurized samples were used as controls. Samples were chill stored for 15 days. Application of HHP treatments reduced viable counts of total aerobic mesophiles and yeasts and molds, and delayed recovery of survivors. Pyrosequencing analysis revealed that 35.7% of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from peaches samples belonged to Actinobacteria (mainly Couchioplanes, Bifidobacterium and Propionibacterium), 31.1% to Firmicutes (mainly Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus) and 28.8% to Proteobacteria (mainly Reyranella, Methylobacterium, Acetobacter, Dyella, Sphingomonas, Tatumella, Enterobacter, Prevotella and Gluconobacter). During storage of control samples, the relative abundances of Gluconobacter and Lactobacillus increased. Application of HHP treatments reduced the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes while Proteobacteria increased. The opposite was observed during storage of the treated samples. Increasing the treatment temperature to 45 °C decreased the relative abundance of Actinobacteria.

     "publication date": "03-2017",
     "abstract": "The use of tangential flow membrane adsorbers is a highly recommendable option for chromatographic separations of particle containing substrates or substrates with high viscosities, like egg white. Due to the direction of the convective flow in this stationary phase, the sample is not required to be filtered. Our earlier study investigated the flow conditions of tangential flow membrane adsorbers. There, it became clear that the flow is based on a mix of convective and diffusive mass transfer. The diffusive component of the transport of the target proteins into the membrane structure depends on the viscosity of the medium according to the Stokes–Einstein equation. Therefore, it was the aim of the present study to assess the impact of viscosity on the ion exchange efficiency. Further, the amount of the main target protein of egg white, the bio-functional protein lysozyme, is relatively low compared to the other major egg white proteins. As a high amount of non-target proteins in the substrate can also interfere with the diffusional mass transfer of the target protein, it was an additional aim to understand the impact of the substrate composition on the lysozyme adsorption.It was shown that the effective diffusion coefficients (Deff) as well as the maximal binding capacities (qmax) strongly depend on the egg white viscosity. Applying natural egg white with a mean viscosity of 70 mPa s, a qmax of 0.14 mg cm−2 with a Deff of 1.5 × 10‐7 cm2 s−1 were achieved. If the viscosity of egg white was reduced by means of a mechanical pre-treatment, qmax was increased to 0.49 mg cm−2 with a Deff of 9.2 × 10−7 cm2 s−1. Consequently, the adsorption efficiency strongly depends on the substrate viscosity. Additionally, the impact of high amounts of non-target proteins in egg white on the adsorption of the target protein lysozyme was analyzed. It was demonstrated that the other egg white proteins strongly interfere the lysozyme binding to the membrane (qmax of 0.49 mg cm−2 compared to 0.65 mg cm−2). This is probably due to steric effects and interactions between the proteins. Finally, it can be concluded that diffusion is an important transport mechanism of tangential flow membrane adsorbers, and if this is disturbed by inappropriate conditions, the process works less well.",

     "abstract": "As the processing control and sensory evaluation of green tea are highly subjective and the tea industry is highly professionalized, it is desirable that to find a more objective way of evaluating the quality of tea is found. In this paper, two models were set up using the BP-MLP and RBF neural networks, a sensory quality prediction model, using eleven parameters measured during processing as variables, such as leaf temperature, moisture content, etc., and a sensory quality evaluation model using fourteen parameters related to green tea as variables, such as image information were set up. The overall results suggested that leaf temperature, moisture content measured during production could effectively predict the sensory quality of green tea, with parameters as image information of green tea able to effectively evaluate its sensory quality. Compared with the BP-MLP neural network, the RBF model displayed much greater accuracy as a prediction model, reducing the relative error from 0.204 to 0.006.",

Ethanol inhibited its own production at a concentration of >20 g L−1. Ethanol productivity was enhanced by continuous in situ extraction with water-immiscible organic solvents. Several solvents were evaluated for biocompatibility with Z. mobilis and the ability to extract ethanol from a batch fermentation. In situ batch extractive fermentations were carried out in a 2-L stirred bioreactor (1:1 volume ratio of solvent and fermentation broth) with an optimal glucose concentration of 150 g L−1, 35 °C, and an agitation speed of 150 rpm. Oleyl alcohol, iso-octadecanol and 2-octyl-1-dodecanol were the three solvents that were most compatible with Z. mobilis. With these solvents, the cell viability relative to control (no solvent) was 1.48 ± 0.40, 1.03 ± 0.18 and 1.05 ± 0.07, respectively, after two days of exposure. All solvents tested improved the final biomass concentration, the glucose consumption and ethanol production relative to control, but iso-octadecanol was clearly the most effective solvent. Using iso-octadecanol, the maximum ethanol concentration of 75 ± 3 g L−1 was attained. This was nearly 1.25-fold that of the control fermentation. For this solvent, the ethanol yield on glucose was 0.485 ± 0.005 g g−1 compared to a yield of 0.468 ± 0.005 g g−1 for the control culture.",

     "abstract": "Post frying conditions play a very important role in consumer acceptability of French fries. During post frying holding time, from when fried potatoes are removed from a fryer to when consumed, texture of the product dramatically changes. Therefore, it is important to understand how and why these changes happen. In this study, the effect of different batter formulations and post frying holding time (with and without using a heat lamp) on fat and moisture distribution, textural and thermal properties of fried potato strips was studied. Moisture content ranged from 3.90 to 5.32 (in core region), 0.54 to 1.19 (in crust region), and 1.96 to 2.89 g/g db (in whole potato strips). Fat content of the core, crust and whole potato strip regions ranged between 0.01–0.03, 0.14–0.25, and 0.07–0.15 g/g db, respectively. A slight migration of moisture from the core to crust regions was observed under heat lamp holding, but this did not affect the total moisture content. Potato samples that were not kept under heat lamp showed lower hardness than samples kept under heat lamp. Brittleness values of potato samples increased from 0 to 10 min heat lamp duration and after that it significantly decreased. It was found that glass transition temperature of the samples was also affected by batter formulation and heat lamp duration.",

The flowing sample solution at pH 4.5 acted as the secondary coil was exposed to the field at 20 kHz to accelerate the extraction. Results revealed that this method was beneficial to the release of oil without affecting oil quality. Positive factors affecting oil yield include the number of reactors connected in both series and parallel, as well as the excitation voltage. Increasing the number of reactors improved in the rate of extraction. Various series and parallel connection modes of the system significantly affected yield even when the input power was held constant. Maximum yield was observed only for the series mode. It has been concluded that the induced electric field-assisted extraction (IEFAE) developed in this study is an ideal technique for the extraction of seed oil because of its high efficiency, avoidance of metal electrode usage.",

In this regard, enzymes are welcomed as process aids in food processing. Microbial lipases, especially of extremophiles, are one of the most useful enzymes for biotechnology and food industry. Accordingly, thermo-halophile GDSL lipase-encoding gene from Rhodothermus marinus, RD, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme revealed the highest hydrolytic activity (1055.3 Umg−1) towards p-nitrophenyl butyrate (C4) at 70 °C/pH 8.5 and retained 78.6% of its initial activity after 60 min incubation at this temperature. The enzyme was recovered by covalent immobilization on chitosan coated Fe3O4-nanoparticles (CS-MNPs) and the potential to synthesize aroma ester methyl acetate in n-hexane was investigated. The reaction yields were 22% and 67% for free and immobilized enzyme, respectively. This study provides a time-saving, economic, biocompatible and a renewable catalyst to synthesize natural flavor compounds. This biocatalyst has excellent potential in food industry and can be applied for lipid processing or to improve the aroma of foods.

The calcium alginate membrane described in this study provides a simple technical medium for sugar separation. Excellent selectivity based on the molecular size of sugar was realized. The mass fraction of homopolymeric blocks of guluronate in alginate polymer chains (FGG) was defined as a gravimetric ratio of homopolymeric blocks of α-l-guluronate in sodium alginate to the total mass of the sodium alginate polymer. FGG was a key factor for regulating the mass transfer characteristics of the calcium alginate membrane. Two different FGG membranes were employed to assess the selective separation of glucose. The effective diffusion coefficient in the membrane (Deff) was determined from the mass transfer flux through the calcium alginate membrane. The effective diffusion coefficient in the FGG 0.56 membrane exhibited a 38-fold decrease in the mixed system of the three sugars, even when the molecular weight showed only a 2.8-fold increase from glucose to raffinose. In the FGG 0.18 membrane, the effective diffusion coefficient exhibited a 14-fold decrease. The mass fraction of guluronate blocks was a dominant factor that regulated the selective diffusion of the sugars. The design of a calcium alginate membrane based on the mass fraction of guluronate blocks is promising for desirable selective sugar separation in industrial applications.",

The protective role of chitosan, either included in the alginate matrix or deposited as an outer layer after formation of microcapsules, on the viability of bacteria was also investigated. Increasing the Na-alginate concentration resulted in larger and more uniform microcapsules. However, the size of microcapsules decreased and their size distribution became narrower by increasing surfactant concentration. Altering the concentration of Ca2+ and chitosan in the collector solution did not affect the size of microcapsules significantly. Encapsulation yield showed that almost 97 and 98% of probiotic bacteria were encapsulated viably within spherical Ca-alginate/chitosan microcapsules by single- and double-stage procedures, respectively. However, it was revealed that the different microcapsule matrices formed by the two fabrication procedures played an important role in survivability of bacteria during storage and exposure to acid.

AOA and total phenolic content were increased by 30% and 6%, respectively, after 2 min processing. The vitamin C, fructose, glucose and maltose contents in HHP treated honey were retained at all processing times. The total carotenoid content was maintained at processing times up to 8 min, while violaxanthin content was reduced by 56% after 15 min. HHP did not change the contents of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, while the diastase activity decreased by 10% after 12 min treatment. Honey exhibited a Newtonian behavior and its viscosity was decreased at all HHP processing conditions. HHP treatment at 600 MPa for 2 min offers an opportunity to enhance the antioxidant properties of honey while reducing its microbiological load and preserving its the general quality parameters of honey.",

     "abstract": "A multiphysics model that coupled electric fields and heat transfer was developed to simulate the radio frequency (RF) heating of food moving on a conveyor belt. A discrete moving step approach was used in the simulation. The total power absorption increased considerably during the entry of the sample into the RF system, remained stable when the sample was fully covered by the top and bottom electrodes, and decreased when the sample moved out of the system. Edge and corner heating was observed from the power absorption distribution and electric field distribution. The model was validated by heating a rectangular container of wheat kernels moving on a conveyor belt in a RF system (27.12 MHz, 6 kW). The predicted spatial temperatures in top, middle, and bottom layers showed less than 3.5 °C lower prediction than the experimental result. The measured anode current showed a good linear correlation with the predicted total power absorption. The optimum number of discrete moving steps was determined to be nine for accurate temperature prediction with total conveyor belt movement distance of 1.13 m which is equivalent to optimize step size of 0.1256 m/step (0.3 m for entry and exit, respectively, and 0.53 m for fully covered by electrodes) at speed of 14.23 m h−1.

The quality attributes such as colour, rehydration ratio, and microstructure of the dried products were also evaluated. Under appropriate conditions, FIR-PVD significantly lowers the drying time compared to hot air drying. The Weibull model was used to calculate the effective moisture diffusivity (Deff), which ranged from 3.72 × 10−10 to 7.31 × 10−10 m2/s. The activation energy was 54.30 kJ/mol determined by Arrhenius equation. The colour parameters of dried wolfberry dried by FIR-PVD were much similar to that of the fresh berries. The rehydration ratio of FIR-PVD dried wolfberry was 2.41 and 2.82 at drying temperatures of 70 and 60 °C, respectively. Porous and fissured microstructure was observed on the surface of dried wolfberry, which can enhance drying kinetics as well as the rehydration process. By comprehensive considering the drying time and quality, drying temperature of 65 °C, vacuum pressure duration of 15 min and ambient pressure duration of 2 min were proposed as the most favourable drying conditions for wolfberry.",

Important correlation coefficients and models were determined to predict the oleoresin, lycopene and β-carotene extraction yields and the relevant DPPH quenching activity as function of the SFE operation parameters.

They find use in a huge variety of applications including wastewater treatment, erosion control, and paper manufacture. Meat and bone meal (MBM) is a high protein by-product of meat processing. Protein extracted from MBM has been shown to have good flocculation activity, but this protein has poor solubility. Previous attempts to improve solubility through alkaline or enzymatic hydrolysis have produced small protein fragments with low flocculation activity. The objective of this project was to produce large, soluble MBM protein fragments by applying reaction conditions that are known to hydrolyze peptide bonds only at aspartic acid and asparagine residues. In this project, milled MBM was suspended in 0.03N hydrogen chloride solution, under vacuum, and incubated at 108 °C. Samples were removed after 1, 2, and 4 h, and the soluble and insoluble material was separated. The molar mass distribution of soluble material was examined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), progressive solubilization of protein was measured by using a test for organic nitrogen, and flocculation activity was tested by measuring kaolin clarification effectiveness (KCE). Results showed that at all hydrolysis times, concentration of solubilized material was increased approximately 3-fold compared to the acid-free controls. Results also showed that as reaction duration increased, more MBM protein was solubilized, but average molecular weight (MW) of solute was reduced, and flocculation activity was dependent on reaction duration. The dilute acid hydrolysis (DAH) employed in this project could be a simple and inexpensive treatment that has potential to add value to MBM and provide a new source for bio-based flocculants.",

Mineral removal for chitin production from crustacean shells has conventionally been carried out with corrosive inorganic acids but in addition to negative potential environmental effects the technique generates detrimental impacts on the physiochemical properties of chitin. Demineralization of crustacean shells using organic acids intensified by microwave is another promising alternative. Although the process has been shown to demineralize shrimp shells with very low mineral residue, the use of a large chemical ratio and high temperature due to a lack of optimization could be major limitations for its industrial application. Moreover, the use of this process for difficult demineralization crustaceans as Rock lobster shells has not yet been investigated. In this study, deproteinized Rock lobster shells were demineralized using a food-grade lactic acid intensified by microwave. This process was optimized using a Box-Behnken design for three key process parameters including lactic acid/shells (LA/S) ratio, time, and temperature. Demineralization degrees achieved from the process were used for setting up a mathematical relationship and drawing plots. Analysis results revealed the LA/S ratio was the most influential factor and the optimized process with high demineralization degrees was achieved at a mild condition (LA/S ratio of 18 mL/g, 23 min). Besides its chemical structure being similar to that of commercially available chitin, lobster chitin obtained from the optimized process had low residues of minerals (0.99%) and protein (1.6%) which could be used for advanced applications. Moreover, composition of minerals recovered from the optimized process contained 87% of calcium potentially providing another value-added product, calcium lactate. All these significant results indicate the microwave-intensified lactic acid demineralization (MILAD) could be used for efficient production of high quality lobster chitin in an environmentally-friendly and sustainable manner.",

Finally, the characterisation of the antioxidant activity of the gels was carried out using three different reagents: DPPH, ABTS and Folin–Ciocalteu. Results put forward that each variable studied, the degree of hydrolysis and pH, are key factors over the thermal processing of gels, showing a remarkable influence on both mechanical properties and antioxidant activity.",

For this aim, drying process was divided into two successive steps by considering a receding emulsion/air interface in the first step and a wet core/crust interface in the second step. A system of differential and algebraic equations was solved numerically using an arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) framework by considering temperature-dependent thermophysical properties for the droplet/particle constituents. The developed model was then validated using experimental drying data obtained for emulsion droplets containing skim milk powder and walnut oil as wall and core materials, respectively. After validation of the developed model, the effects of drying air temperature (80–140 °C), air velocity (0.02–3 m/s), and droplet initial diameter (0.01–0.75 mm) on the droplet/particle drying behavior were systematically investigated. The simulation results agreed fairly well with the experimental data indicating the suitability of the developed model for predicting drying characteristics of liquid droplets containing functional oils. According to the results, drying behavior of emulsion droplets/particles was significantly affected by the variables considered. This work further demonstrated the merits of phenomenological models for tracking and controlling the physicochemical attributes of droplets/particles containing functional ingredients.

The specific exergy destruction of pasteurized yogurt drink was determined as 442 kJ/kg according to the mass allocation method. The steam generator had the highest contribution to the specific exergy destruction of pasteurized yogurt drink, followed by yogurt drink production, above-zero refrigeration, and milk reception, pasteurization, and standardization lines, respectively. In general, the current survey can be an important step for future improvements of dairy processing plants from the sustainability and productivity viewpoints. This study clearly showed the effectiveness of exergy analysis for determining irreversibilities and losses occurring in dairy processing plants in order to improve their thermodynamic performances.",

MWM produced OJ with smaller particle sizes (55.0 ± 1.05 μm) than conventional methods and increased the nutritional and antioxidant properties of the concentrated juice over the commercial OJ. VSD process was conducted at low temperature (40–60 °C) using superheated steam (200 °C) as a heating medium and maltodextrin (13DE) as a carrier. The effects of VSD on physicochemical and antioxidant properties of MWM OJ powders produced with four different weight ratios of juice solids to maltodextrin solids; 60:40, 50:50, 40:60 and 30:70 were investigated. The obtained powders were analyzed for moisture content, water activity, bulk density, tapped density, particle density, porosity, and particle size and distributions and microstructure of the particles. The quality in respect to the physical properties of OJ powders was improved except color parameter with increases of maltodextrin solids. The VSD powders retained a higher amount of ascorbic acid, total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) than spray drying. MWM orange powder with overall good quality in terms of color, yield, ascorbic acid, TFC, TPC and DPPH activity was successfully produced by VSD.",

However, satisfactory prediction of the cleaning performance of such jets has so far only been achieved in small scale experiments. In the present work, cleaning with a horizontal water jet was studied using a 19 m3 tank and settings applicable to industrial operations; nozzle internal diameters, dN, of 2–5.5 mm, cleaning distances, L, of 80–2490 mm, and flow rates, Q, of 0.05–3.0 m3 h−1. Experimental data and model predictions of the behaviour of the jet when striking an unsoiled surface showed reasonable agreement for a nozzle with dN = 2 mm at small cleaning distances (L 80 and 200 mm). At greater dN and cleaning distances there was poorer agreement, which was attributed to jet break-up and splatter.Similar observations were made when cleaning a surface soiled with white petroleum jelly. The evolution of the cleaned area was predicted reasonably well for experiments with dN = 2 mm, L = 80 mm, and soil layer thicknesses of 0.25–1.49 mm. For longer cleaning distances and larger dN only the initial stages of cleaning could be modelled, because jet break-up introduced complexities and momentum losses not accounted for in the mathematical models. The effects of jet break-up can partly be accommodated, in practice, by correcting the jet flow rate for these momentum losses.",

In the present work, mass sources are connected with mass sinks through alternative “operators” (processes) whose exit streams are of different compositions. A superstructure is constructed that embeds economically feasible processes proposed in the literature, that produce intermediate goods salable to other factories or that can be recycled to the same refinery.The optimal solution for our case study was the selection of a process to obtain pre-soap to be sold to a neighbor factory that produces industrial detergents. Afterward, the price of pre-soap was halved, pretending that the closest detergent factory is located way far from the refinery. In this case, the model selects a process that separates oil to be recycled to the refining process, and FFAs to be used as fuel in the same refinery. Thus, the optimal solutions found are valid for the particular case studied, while the main contribution of this paper is the approach proposed to make a decision.",

Hygrothermal continuum modeling is used to obtain insight on the impact of moisture barriers on the fruit dehydration process. The effects of moisture permeability and thickness of the barrier on the drying process are quantified, by looking into the drying kinetics and the internal moisture transport. Barriers are found to induce a smaller drying rate and a higher product temperature, but lead to more spatially-uniform drying within the sample. The sensitivity of the total drying time to the barrier’s permeability is also found to be dependent on the permeability of the fruit tissue itself. The presence of a barrier significantly reduced the sensitivity of the drying time to an increase in air speed, thus convective transfer coefficients. Such hygrothermal simulations are a promising way to tailor moisture barriers to a specific application, in terms of optimal barrier permeability and thickness, to obtain the required drying characteristics.",

The process involves the clarification of aqueous extracts from dried milled stevia leaves with a 0.2 μm ceramic membrane followed by ultrafiltration/diafiltration with either a 15 or a 3 kDa membrane. During ultrafiltration a range of hydrodynamic operating conditions were evaluated with both membranes (15 and 3 kDa) in order to find the best compromise between working under sustainable flux and eliminating most of the contaminants from the extracts. In addition, principles from high performance tangential flow filtration and continuous diafiltration were combined to increase yield recovery and to reduce operation time. Results indicate that aqueous extracts from stevia plants grown in different regions have different contaminants and glycosides concentrations. Therefore, different membrane pore sizes and operating conditions are needed to obtain high sustainable flux values (≥21 kg/m2 h) during isolation of glycosides. Moreover, the experimental approach used in the concentration/diafiltration process allowed not only for removal of most of the contaminants, but also for an increase in the sweetener yield and a 50% reduction of process time while keeping similar properties of purified extracts, despite their initial composition.",

The enthalpy of gelatinization decreased accordingly (ΔHstarch−water−sucrose > ΔHstarch−water−carrageenan > ΔHstarch−water).

     "abstract": "End-over-end (EoE) rotation is a common type of mechanical agitation used in canning sterilization process to increase heating rates, enabling reductions in processing time and energy use and improving quality. During EoE rotation, cans are rotated around a circle in a vertical plane for improved mixing and heat transfer. The rotation makes it difficult to characterize time-temperature history of the process by an experimental set-up. Even though remote temperature logging methodologies have been developed, the general approach in the literature was to develop empirical approaches for heat transfer coefficient. Since time-temperature history of the process must be known to determine process lethality, changes in quality attributes and further optimize the process, computational modeling of EoE dynamics is of great interest. Therefore, the objective of this study was to present computational modeling of an EoE process for canned particulate products to provide a detailed insight of the EoE rotation. This study included a 3-dimensional modeling using a volume of fluid (VOF) multiphase approach with rotating mesh. Movement of entrapped headspace dynamics via the effect of liquid viscosity suggested a possible explanation about the complex non-linear effect of rotation rate on heat transfer enhancement. Effect of viscosity and rotational speed were determined for overall understanding of heat transfer to give insights of the EoE rotation for canning particulate food products.",

     "abstract": "A new canning process where a reciprocating agitation is carried out in horizontally oriented containers has been recently demonstrated to reduce processing times and enable energy savings with less degradation in the quality of processed food products. Reciprocal agitation by imposing additional forces enhances convective mixing with increased production efficiency. The reciprocal agitation uses the horizontal acceleration in addition to gravity and sum of these forces lead to a considerable increase in the heat transfer rates. In the literature, there have been experimental approaches to evaluate heat transfer enhancement. However, due to the balance among these forces, there might be an optimum reciprocal agitation rate for the increased heat transfer depending upon the physical properties of the liquid processed. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine the optimum agitation rates by developing a computational model for heat transfer. For this purpose, a multi-phase model simulation was performed using a finite volume method based on discretization of governing flow equations for liquid and gas phase in a non-inertial reference frame of moving mesh. Experimental studies for model validation were carried out in a reciprocally agitated retort using 98.2 mm × 115 mm cans containing distilled water with 2% headspace as a model case. The model results were in agreement with the experimental data, and the optimum reciprocal agitation rate was determined.

The waste exiting the peeler/scrubber unit is decanted to separate skins and seeds from the aqueous portion of the waste stream. This aqueous suspension represents the inefficiency in over peeling of tomatoes. Recycling the slurry would reduce waste generated from the peeling operation thereby increasing process efficiency. A constant volume dilution (CVD) membrane filtration process was designed to perform a chemical-free neutralization of the tomato slurry. Through the CVD process, the active alkali of the slurry was reduced from 0.7 to less than 0.01 mol/L and electrical conductivity of the suspension decreased from 27 to less than 0.1 mS/cm. Additionally, electrical conductivity and active alkali were found to have a linear relationship (r2 = 0.9962) showing that one value can adequately predict the other in this system. All of the indicators of neutralization fit log-linear to the derived stirred tank processes model with significant correlation coefficients. This work shows that a CVD process using membrane technology has the potential to reclaim tomato waste from caustic peeling and that the filtration can be adequately modelled.",

The thin layer drying experiments of the kernel and shell of the macadamia nuts were conducted at a temperature of 40 °C, 50 °C and 60 °C and relative humidity of 10%, 20% and 30%. The moisture diffusivity of the kernel and shell of the macadamia nut was determined by minimizing the sum of square of the deviation between the predicted and the experimental moisture contents values during the thin layer experiments. The diffusivity of the kernel and shell was expressed as functions of temperature using the Arrhenius type equation and the moisture diffusivity of the kernel was higher than that of the shell of the macadamia nuts. A two-dimensional finite element drying model of macadamia nut was developed and this model predicted reasonably the moisture contents during drying.

Agaricus bisporus L. is the world's most consumed mushroom and one of the richest sources of ergosterol. Microwave-assisted extraction was used to replace conventional techniques that are time-consuming and need large amounts of solvent. Time (3–20 min), temperature (60–210 °C) and solid-liquid ratio (1–20 g/L) were found the relevant variables to analyze the extraction process. To maximize the ergosterol extraction yield, response surface methodology was used to optimize the process. The global optimal extraction conditions were determined and comprise: 19.4 ± 2.9 min, 132.8 ± 12.4 °C and 1.6 ± 0.5 g/L, yielding 556.1 ± 26.2 mg of ergosterol per 100 g of mushroom by-products. In the MAE optimal conditions, it was possible to obtain ergosterol in a similar value to the one obtained in other works when using the Soxhlet extraction method with a significant decrease in the time of extraction.

     "abstract": "Industrial breadmaking equipment typically processes batches of 200 kg or more of raw ingredients, while scaled down versions are widely used for research and development studies. A literature review shows that the use of domestic breadmakers has become routine to enable cheaper and more convenient small batch production of bread which facilitates assessment of new ingredients and formulations, and for other studies on bread and the breadmaking process. However, whilst recipe formulations can be scaled down, the process in a breadmaker may not be an accurate representation of industrial processes, leading to differences in aspects of bread quality and the nature and direction of ingredient effects. This short communication assesses whether breadmaker-produced bread is representative of bread produced using industrial methods, and therefore if the results of studies conducted on breadmaker-produced breads are representative of those that would be obtained on industrial equipment. A study of some quality parameters in breads made using a household breadmaker versus scaled down industrial breadmaking equipment showed an opposing trend for the relationship between sugar content and specific volume, and between sugar content and crumb firmness, in loaves made from both methods. The differing quality parameters of breadmaker-produced loaves compared to loaves produced in scaled down industrial breadmaking equipment suggested that breadmaker-produced breads can give misleading indications of likely ingredient effects at industrial scale.",

The processes performances were evaluated in terms of hydroxytyrosol (HT) and reducing carbohydrates (RC) release yields, and enzyme productivities. Enzymatic hydrolysis of OOMW of the tested enzyme preparations had shown an increase of HT and RC release yields. These ranged between 0.42 and 0.87% (g HT produced/100 g dry matter), and between 3.06 and 9.7% (g RC/100 g dry matter), respectively. The kinetic parameters (maximal release rate and half-saturation constant) determined by an alternative approach to the classical Michaelis-Menten model has shown that produced enzyme preparation had an initial release rate of 0.02 g HT/L min, which is comparable to rates obtained in the presence of Viscozyme L, Novarom Blanc and Peclyve Lif Plus. The antioxidant activity of the ethyl acetate extract of OOMW, measured by the DPPH method, was drastically enhanced after the different enzymatic treatments. This study demonstrates that enzymatic treatment is a potential method for the valorization of OOMW in order to produce valuable compounds with promising applications in the food industry.",

The clarification of fruit juices by membrane separation illustrates an example of enhancing the shelf life of a real fruit juice by removing degradable components.

The proposed model developed from the first principle boundary layer analysis, describes the physical mass transport phenomena and quantifies the various extents of fouling using different membrane materials and operating conditions. The model results are useful in understanding the complex solute–membrane interplay in fouling and can predict the effect of gel layer thickness on the process throughput.In this work, the model results were validated experimentally in clarification of blood orange juice in batch mode using two polysulphone (PS) membranes and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membrane in hollow fiber configuration, with different molecular-weight-cut-off (MWCO). The results clearly indicated that PS membranes are more prone to fouling at higher pressures compared to PAN membrane. An increase in the feed flow rate had a significant effect in reducing the growth of gel layer mainly in PS membranes.",

The second distillation step resulted in a product with ethanol concentration of 76% (v/v) and the third step yielded ethanol concentration of 84% (v/v). Results were compared to conventional hydrodistillation (HD), and were indicative that OAHD reduces one third of energy cost in ethanol distillation process. Not only was OAHD superior to HD in terms of time and energy consumption, but also resulted in higher ethanol concentrations than HD after the third step of distillation: 84.3 ± 0.3% vs. 82.5 ± 0.5%, respectively. OAHD also showed better process control and was able to stop the distillation process faster than HD. In both second and third distillation steps, the time required to stop the process with OAHD (1 min) was shorter than for HD process (10 min). The findings of this study further confirm our previous work, and reveal that this emerging distillation technique has the potential of yielding high concentrations of ethanol from dilute alcoholic solutions in a more economical and environmental friendly way.",

The Ostwald–de Waele model was successfully used to describe the flow properties of meat emulsions (R2 > 0.913). Emulsion systems were characterized as weak gel-like macromolecular dispersions with storage modulus (G′) much greater than loss modulus (G″). A modified Cox–Merz rule was applied by multiplying angular frequency with shift factors (αSF). Material stiffness parameter (Aα) calculated from complex modulus (G*) increased as SBF concentration increased. Significant correlations among the material stiffness data and TPA parameters were observed.

Dehydration of grape pomace is the first step before extraction.

Drying (moisture vs time) data were obtained on slabs of grape pomace in an air dryer operating at 60–85 °C. The effective diffusivity was determined using the method of slopes of the drying curve taking into account the effect of moisture content on diffusivity. The combined effect of moisture content and temperature on effective diffusivity was expressed by an empirical model. In addition, each moisture loss curve was fit to empirical simplified drying models. Finally, the effects of solvent type, extraction temperature, solvent/solid ratio, amplitude level, and pulse duration/pulse interval ratio on the yield of phenolics extraction were studied.",

Regarding nitrogen solubility index of the protein present in defatted meal, a decrease was observed after the oil extraction process, being more prominent for systems where aqueous solvents were used. From the results, it can be inferred that alcoholic solvents enable extracting corn oils with a typical fatty acid composition; aqueous ethanol leads the extraction of higher levels of tocopherols and tocotrienols (449 and 195 mg/kg, respectively) and absolute isopropanol has the best performance in the extraction of carotenoids (373 mg/kg).",

An environmental performance evaluation was done to benchmark performance of the company with published data including Best Available Techniques (BATs) determined by The European IPPC Bureau (EIPPCB). Four broad objectives were set improving the resource efficiency and adding value to solid wastes/by-products. 18 different techniques/measures for reducing waste and adding value to the by-product were identified. Three of the techniques/measures were selected and implemented within the company. Specific water consumption decreased 65% and 77% in anchovy thawing and gutting processes, respectively. Because anchovy is the major product of the company, total water saving was 45.0%. Annual total water saving was estimated to be 29,002 m3. The water recycling system introduced in the gutting process enabled t production of valuable fish oil/grease by-product. Payback period for the implementations was estimated to be 1.6 years. This study demonstrated that environmental and economic benefits can be obtained in the Turkish seafood industry.",

     "abstract": "The pineapple industry generates significant amounts of residues which are classified as lignocellulosic residual biomass. In the present paper, microwaves are studied as a pretreatment to improve pineapple waste saccharification. Different microwave (MW) powers (10.625, 8.5, 6.375, 4.25 and 2.125 W/g) and exposure times (1–20 min) were applied to the solid part of the waste before enzymatic hydrolysis. Infrared thermography was used to assess temperature evolution and structural modifications were evaluated by Cryo-SEM. Sugar content and fermentation inhibitors (phenols, furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural) were also determined. MW increased sugar yield as long as intermediate powers were used (up to 6.375 W/g). However, high powers and longer treatments resulted in sugar degradation and/or a decrease in the efficiency of the enzymatic hydrolysis process. Temperature records indicated that thermal sugar degradation may occur in those cases. The presence of fermentation inhibitors have been confirmed and related to prolonged MW treatments. Microscopic observations suggested that mild microwave pretreatments may promote microstructural changes that enhance enzyme performance, whereas harsher treatments could increase tissue compactness and reduce the effectiveness of the enzymatic treatment. It is concluded that microwave pretreatments using the appropriate energy supply and exposure time enhances saccharification efficiency, potentially improving further bioethanol yield.",

Besides the usual constituents of the surface passive layer, N and Cl were also identified. Additionally, the XPS suggested that the N was bound in ammonium salts, e.g., NH4Cl, and the Cl was in the form of chlorides. This is consistent with the pitting corrosion of the stainless steels AISI 304 and AISI 430 being due to their regular exposure to an ammonia-based cleaning agent and to substances containing chloride ions.",

By using the experimental drying kinetics and adopting a numerical procedure for solving the Fick's diffusion equation, the mass diffusion coefficient was determined as a function of the temperature and water content of the product. Using the constraint relaxation test, with a texture analysis machine, the mechanical properties of grains of dried grapes were measured. The relaxation function and the Young's modulus were then deduced. These characteristics are key parameters in running simulation models addressing the thermo hydro mechanical behavior and allow the appropriate process and drying time to be subsequently determined in order to avoid unnecessary energy consumption.",

     "abstract": "Fermentation is an essential step in beer brewing: when yeast is added to hopped wort, sugars released from the grain during germination are fermented into ethanol and higher alcohols. To study, simulate and optimise the beer fermentation process, accurate models of the chemical system are required for dynamic simulation of key component concentrations. Since the entire beer production process is a highly complex series of chemical reactions with the presence of over 600 species, many of the specific interactions are not quantitatively understood, a comprehensive dynamic model is impractical.This paper presents a computational implementation of a detailed model describing an industrial beer fermentation process, which is used to simulate published temperature manipulations and compare results with those obtained following the protocol currently in place at WEST Beer brewery (Glasgow, Scotland, UK). A trade-off between design objectives has been identified, making determination of a single optimal scenario challenging. A simulated annealing (SA) algorithm has been developed in order to pursue stochastic optimisation of the fermentor temperature manipulation profile, on the basis of generating an enormous set of plausible manipulations which adhere to suitable operability constraints at an appropriate level of temporal domain discretisation. The objective function considers ethanol maximisation as well as batch time minimisation (with variable weight allocation), and explicit constraints on diacetyl and ethyl acetate concentrations. Promising temperature manipulations have been determined, allowing for batch time reductions of as high as 15 h: this represents a substantial decrease in production cycle time, and is thus expected to improve annual plant throughput and profitability, without any discernible effect on flavour.",

Since there is an increasing demand for natural products, we designed an alternative method of 2-PE production. The utilization of yeast biomass in the production of natural 2-PE is a promising alternative for both chemical synthesis and expensive plant extraction. Here, we investigated the JM2014 yeast strain, which we recently isolated from a fermented milk drink and classified as a species of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To produce 2-PE, we used a 4 L batch culture of the JM2014 strain in a laboratory-scale bioreactor and, subsequently, developed a method of isolation and purification of 2-PE from the broth. Within 72 h, the not-genetically modified JM2014 strain produced 3.60 g L−1 of 2-PE in the simple batch culture, which corresponds to an overall efficiency of the biotransformation step of 97.21%. Through the application of appropriately selected techniques and reagents, we extracted 2-PE that meets the criteria for a natural product with a 78% efficiency and a purity of >98% (GC). This is the first report documenting a complete methodology for 2-PE production, from biotransformation to purification of the final product.",

The loss of the antioxidant properties was apparently dependent on the drying conditions, especially on temperature. When the drying temperature was set lower than 50 °C, the antioxidant properties were retained to a larger extent, whereas lesser quantities could be retained at a drying temperature of 80 °C. A simple mathematical model was employed to simulate the temperature profiles during drying, and the resultant phycocyanin content was predicted using the temperature profiles and the experimentally obtained kinetic data of the degradation. These model equations were simple enough to be solved using commercial spreadsheet software, and the profiles of moisture content, mean temperature, and remaining phycocyanin content were predicted as a function of time. Based on the simulation results, an attempt was made to dry at two temperature steps, namely at 80 °C during the constant rate drying period, and at 50 °C during the falling rate drying period. This attempt, drying with two temperature steps, could successfully reduce the total drying time and retain greater amount of antioxidants in the resultant dried products.",

Both simulated and experimental results showed similar heating patterns in RF treated chestnuts under same conditions, in which corners and edges were overheated and highest temperatures were located in sample contact points of top and middle layers at four corners in the container. A heating uniformity index (HUI) was used to evaluate effects of processing conditions on RF heating uniformity. The simulated and experimental results showed that the HUI was reduced when three layers chestnuts were separated with two plastic sheets. The better heating uniformity in chestnuts was obtained when they were treated with a single layer, or under mixing conditions. The developed model can help to explore the RF heating patterns on a single particle chestnut and RF heating uniformity in chestnuts of the container, and provide valuable methods to improve the RF heating uniformity for future industrial applications.",

     "abstract": "Bioactive compounds from passion fruit industry by-products (rinds) were obtained using ethanolic-water pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), a green and intensified extraction process. The PLE method was compared with Soxhlet and maceration. Ethanol, water, and their mixtures were used as solvents. PLE and maceration conditions were: temperature 30–60 °C, ethanol concentration 70–100% (v/v), pressure 10 MPa (PLE) and atmospheric pressure (maceration). The extraction processes were evaluated in terms of global yield, total phenolic content, phenolic composition, and antioxidant activity. PLE achieved extracts with higher global yield, phenolic content, and antioxidant activity than the conventional methods. Based on these results and the fast extraction time, PLE at 60 °C using 70% ethanol was the best method to recover bioactive compounds from passion fruit rinds. Five phenolic compounds were identified and quantified in the extracts: isoorientin, vicenin, vitexin, orientin, and isovitexin. The antioxidant capacity and phenolic content exhibited high and positive correlation expressed by the Pearson’s coefficient. Extraction kinetics were performed and showed that target compounds could be recovered in short extraction times at the best PLE condition. The passion fruit rinds have therefore proved to be a rich source of phenolic compounds and PLE showed high efficiency to recover such compounds.",

Comparative evaluation of the drying kinetics, specific energy consumption (SEC) and quality (in terms of color, aloin, total polysaccharides and acemannan contents as well as microbial counts) of the products undergone different drying processes was made. Electric field strength had a significant effect on the drying kinetics, SEC and quality of the dried product. On the other hand, HVEF exhibited a dominant effect on the drying kinetics only at a lower air velocity (0.2 m/s). Application of HVEF could significantly reduce the SEC of the drying process at an air velocity of 0.2 m/s. The optimum condition for aloe vera puree drying using hot air in combination with FIR and HVEF was the use of an air velocity of 0.2 m/s, temperature of 70 °C and high-voltage electric field strength of 3.75 kV/cm.",

Results indicate that the miniature bread baking is essentially analogical to the baking process of regular-sized bread: quality-related properties of miniature breads, such as crumb formation, crust thickness, crust color and moisture content, behaved similarly to regular-sized breads (380 g) during baking, albeit at a different time scale. This was explained as analogous for large breads, initially baking is externally limited and only later internal limitations play a dominant role with the crust being formed. After initial development of the crust, the lightness and the total color difference were found linearly correlated with the crust thickness. Moreover, the S-REA (spatial reaction engineering approach) was used here to model the moisture content and temperature during miniature bread baking whose results were implemented to describe the browning kinetics. The results indicate that the S-REA accurately models the browning kinetics during miniature bread baking.",

Process parameters considered were pressure (300–600 MPa), number of pressure pulses or cycles (1–3) and isobaric pressure-hold time (1 s to 45 min). PP resulted in increased activity of both the enzymes, and its effect was more pronounced on POD than PPO. Effect of SP on enzymes was assumed as a two-stage inactivation: initial impact of pressurization–depressurization step calculated as pulse effect (PE), and effect of isobaric stage described using various kinetic models, among which the biphasic first-order reaction model fitted best. Further, an empirical model was proposed to explain the combined effect of pressurization–depressurization and isobaric phases on the enzymes inactivation as a function of pressure and hold-time during SP of litchi juice. During CP, the effect of number of cycles was found to be dissimilar on both the enzymes in litchi juice, and it was relatively more effective than SP for their inactivation.

Maintaining yeast cultures under sufficient aeration, however, is a significant challenge in yeast propagation. Due to their high surface area, microbubbles are more efficient in mass transfer than coarse bubbles. The performance of an airlift loop bioreactor equipped with a fluidic oscillator generated microbubbles in yeast propagation is presented here. The approach is compared with a conventional bubble generation method that produces coarse bubbles. Dosing with microbubbles transferred more oxygen to the cultures, achieving non-zero dissolved O2 levels and consequently, eliminating the starvation state of yeast in contrast to coarse bubble sparging. The average cell growth yield obtained under microbubble sparging reached 0.31 mg/h (±0.02) while 0.22 mg/h (±0.01) was recorded for cells grown with coarse bubbles during the log phase. The percent difference in average growth yield after 6 hours was 18%. Additionally, the use of microbubbles in yeast harvest from growth medium proved effective, yielding >99% cell recovery. The result of this study is crucial for the biofuel industry but also, the food, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industry for which end product purity is premium.",

Further, swelling and water binding capacities of fibres, after conducting chemical modification, were three to four times higher than for non-modified fibres. Uniform reduction of a drying time with a rising temperature and fluctuating drying rate decrease were observed in modified fibres samples.

However, in the traditional cooling system of strawberry considerable differences are observed between the fruit temperature located in the individual packages as well as in the various packages inside the tray. As a result, the self-life of fruit decreases. The aim of this research was introducing the new package and cooling system for precooling of strawberry in which some improvements were made in the uniformity of cooling of strawberry and reduced the fruit decay. The cooling process of strawberry was simulated based on simultaneous airflow and heat transfer process inside the new system and the developed model was validated experimentally, and a good agreement observed between the simulated and measured temperature of fruit. The results of simulator and experimental data showed that the new system had the higher uniformity in the cooling of fruit as compare with the traditional system so that the packages located along the cold air direction received the equal airflow rate. As a result, a difference of 0.84 °C was measured in the average fruit temperature of the packages after 3 h of cooling meaning that the differences in the 7/8th cooling time of fruit between the packages is negligible. Therefore, with the same airflow rate of traditional system, the cooling time of strawberries could be reducing by the proposed system significantly.",

The protein denaturation degree and the solubility in the prepared protein concentrate were compared with a commercial canola protein isolate. Partial loss of the protein native structure was observed in the protein concentrate. The ζ-potential in the soluble fraction of the protein concentrate dispersion was ca. 20 mV lower (more negative) compared with the commercial isolate at pHs 4–10, which was attributed to the presence of charged carbohydrates such as pectin in the protein concentrate. To improve the dispersion stability of the protein concentrate, enzymatic crosslinking with transglutaminase and microfluidization at 1850 bars were applied. Microfluidization resulted in the formation of rod-like aggregates formed mainly of the insoluble cell wall polysaccharides glued together with proteins as imaged by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Improvement in colloidal stability was observed in all samples upon microfluidization.

The behaviour was marked by an initially steady rate of drainage in which an air slug descended the tube, followed by slower drainage from an annular film remaining on the wall. Eventually the liquid stopped draining as a filament and entered a dripping regime. Drainage was insensitive to the tube material, whereas the stages of drainage were influenced by the geometry and angle of inclination. Quantitative models are presented for the rate and extent of the initial drainage stage, the rate in a second linear stage (where it existed), and the rate of drainage in the third, falling rate stage. The fourth and final stage, characterised by drop formation, was not modelled. The initial rate can be predicted with reasonable accuracy, allowing the time to remove approximately 50% of the material in a short waiting phase to be calculated, e.g. t = 8νL/R2g for a Newtonian liquid with kinematic viscosity ν in a vertical pipe of radius R and length L.

     "abstract": "Lactic acid (LA) is considered for the diversification and value addition to sugar industry in South Africa, through a bioconversion of sugarcane bagasse and leaves. A bioconversion process was modeled in Aspen Plus® V8.6 and its environmental impacts were evaluated using the Life Cycle Assessment method using SimaPro® considering its integration into existing South African Sugar mills. The life cycle approach took into account the whole sugar production chain, including sugarcane cultivation stage, harvesting and transportation of sugarcane, sugar mill, and LA production. The life cycle inventories of the sugarcane cultivation and sugar mill were obtained from literature while Aspen Plus® simulation data were used for the LA production. The ecoinvent database of SimaPro® was used for all external inputs and fossil-based LA production. Environmental impacts of the biobased and fossil based LA productions were assessed and compared. The total environmental savings of the major impact categories obtained upon replacing a tonne of fossil-based LA with biobased LA are: 3925.65 kg CO2 eq. of global warming potential; 1742.05 kg fossil fuel eq. of abiotic depletion potential; 1296.16 kg 1,4-DB eq. of human toxicity potential; 397.79 kBq U235 eq. of ionizing radiation potential; 253.97 kg Fe eq. of metal depletion potential; 43.48 kg 1,4-DB eq. of marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential; 42.97 kg 1,4-DB eq. of fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity potential and 18.23 kg SO2 eq. of acidification potential. Auxiliary chemicals used in the biobased LA production are most relevant to the total environmental impacts. Thus, biobased LA production has significantly reduced the impact on the environment, giving 80–99% environmental savings compared to fossil-derived LA.",

     "abstract": "Food industry is critical to any nation's health and well-being; it is also critical to the economic health of a nation, since it can typically constitute over a fifth of the nation's manufacturing GDP. Food Engineering is a discipline that ought to be at the heart of the food industry. Unfortunately, this discipline is not playing its rightful role today: engineering has been relegated to play the role of a service provider to the food industry, instead of it being a strategic driver for the very growth of the industry. This paper hypothesises that food engineering discipline, today, seems to be continuing the way it was in the last century, and has not risen to the challenges that it really faces. This paper therefore categorises the challenges as those being posed by: 1. Business dynamics, 2. Market forces, 3. Manufacturing environment and 4. Environmental Considerations, and finds the current scope and subject-knowledge competencies of food engineering to be inadequate in meeting these challenges. The paper identifies: a) health, b) environment and c) security as the three key drivers of the discipline, and proposes a new definition of food engineering. This definition requires food engineering to have a broader science base which includes biophysical, biochemical and health sciences, in addition to engineering sciences. This definition, in turn, leads to the discipline acquiring a new set of subject-knowledge competencies that is fit-for-purpose for this day and age, and hopefully for the foreseeable future. The possibility of this approach leading to the development of a higher education program in food engineering is demonstrated by adopting a theme based curriculum development with five core themes, supplemented by appropriate enabling and knowledge integrating courses. At the heart of this theme based approach is an attempt to combine engineering of process and product in a purposeful way, termed here as Food Product Realisation Engineering. Finally, the paper also recommends future development of two possible niche specialisation programs in Nutrition and Functional Food Engineering and Gastronomic Engineering. It is hoped that this reconceptualization of the discipline will not only make it more purposeful for the food industry, but it will also make the subject more intellectually challenging and attract bright young minds to the discipline.",

     "abstract": "Industrial wheat milling processes are based on a gradual size reduction approach, with repeated milling and sieving steps to achieve appropriate breakage of the wheat kernel and its effective reduction into flour. This approach greatly increases the flour yield, but makes the process more difficult to understand and operate. In this respect, mathematical modeling can be very useful to optimize industrial milling operations by relating the operating variables to the final product quality and quantity.As a first step toward the modeling of an entire wheat milling process, in this study experimental data were generated from roller mills and plansifters, and the data were used to build multivariate statistical models enabling one to improve process understanding and to predict the particle size distribution of the milled material and of the sieved material, as well as the amount of material remaining on each sieve, from the known operating conditions and wheat moisture. The unit operation models were then concatenated, and the propagation of prediction errors was analyzed. The results are very satisfactory, in that a comprehension of the breakage mechanism was obtained with a single modeling framework that unifies the modeling results obtained in existing studies, and the product quality and amount were predicted with good accuracy. The results on prediction error propagation show that, although the models are data-driven, the design of the plansifter model can be done independently of that of the roller mill model, since the prediction error did not propagate across the models strongly.",

     "abstract": "Microwave heating of frozen foods involves multiple physics and food product development has been trial-and-error in the food industry. Multiphysics models can be used to understand microwave interactions and can assist in design of food that can be heated more uniformly. A comprehensive three-dimensional finite element model for describing microwave heating of a food product on a rotating turntable is developed including multiphysics of Maxwell's electromagnetic heating, energy conservation, Darcy's velocity, mass conservations of water and gas, and phase change of melting and evaporation of water. The necessity of incorporating mass transfer physics was investigated and confirmed. Twelve discrete rotational steps were used in one rotational cycle. Two approaches of updating dielectric properties at each rotational step (typical) and each cycle (simplified) were evaluated. The models using typical and simplified approaches were developed and validated for heating of a 550 g tray of frozen mashed potato for 6 min in a 1250 W microwave oven on a rotating turntable. The spatial variation of the top surface temperatures of the mashed potato acquired by an infrared camera, the transient temperatures at six locations recorded by fiber optic sensors, and the total moisture loss during heating all showed good agreement with the simulation results for both approaches. The typical and simplified approaches had similar RMSE values of transient temperatures of, respectively, 13.1 and 13.2 °C, while the RMSE values between experimental replications was 8.0 °C. The RMSE values of total moisture loss of were similar (2.2 and 2.4 g) for both approaches. With 83% reduction in computation time for the simplified approach, this method can be used to evaluate the microwave heating of food products and accelerate microwaveable food products development.",

In such applications, it is important to know the particle suspension stability and the release kinetics of encapsulated molecular payload under different environmental conditions. The present work reports on the preparation and characterization of YGPs and the measurement of the diffusion rate of several water-soluble bioactive substances with varying molecular weight (caffeine, vitamin B12 and BSA) across the glucan wall as function of temperature and pH. The release rate constant has been evaluated by means of a mathematical model and its temperature dependence was found to be linear in the range from 10 to 60 °C at pH 7.4 despite a glass transition of particulate β-glucan at 46 °C.",

Extraction time and ethanol concentration were found to have only minor effect on the extraction yield. Six hour extraction time and 20 vol.% ethanol concentration were found to be sufficient. The resulting anthocyanin-rich extract contained glucose, proteins, amino acids, and unidentified compounds as impurities. Removal of these by adsorption was studied with six commercially available adsorbents, of which Amberlite XAD-7HP was the most efficient. Anthocyanin purification with XAD-7HP was studied in a column. The effects of flow rate on adsorption, and ethanol and acetic acid concentrations on desorption were investigated. In loading, a highly dispersed anthocyanins breakthrough curve was obtained. This most likely resulted from agglomeration of anthocyanins. Desorption of anthocyanins could be done efficiently with 75 vol.% acidic (7 vol.% acetic acid) aqueous ethanol.

The yeasts biomass was separated from the fermented broth by centrifugation leaving residual soluble proteins in the fermented whey supernatant (FWS).

The characteristics of the proteins were evaluated by electrophoresis. During fermentation, a fraction of the whey proteins was consumed. The electrophoresis results revealed that the fermented proteins were different from the native whey proteins and that they were partially hydrolyzed.

This work examines the use of a culture of Gluconobacter japonicus CECT 8443, without pH control, to convert selectively the glucose content of industrially pasteurized strawberry purée into gluconic acid for the development of new beverages. However, depending on the initial concentration of glucose, the microorganism could transform the acid formed into other compounds; for this reason, in this work the effect of initial sugar concentration on the preservation of the acid was investigated. The results show that the gluconic acid formed in strawberry purée containing no added sugars started to disappear after glucose depletion, but the acid concentration remained constant if sugar-enriched purée was used. The use of this industrial substrate resulted in the presence of yeasts and hence in some fructose uptake; however, the fructose consumption was negligible until after 20–30 h. The use of food by-products is an excellent opportunity not only to recover valuable compounds but for the development of new chemical and biotechnological approaches for their revalorization.

Vitamin C, colour, texture, drip loss after thawing and sensory characteristics of pre-treated and conventionally frozen samples were kinetically studied at isothermal conditions, and their temperature dependence was modelled by the Arrhenius equation. Dehydrofrozen samples exhibited a significantly improved vitamin C stability especially at temperatures, below −12 °C.

Colour deterioration was more intense in the case of untreated frozen strawberry samples. Osmo-dehydrofrozen compared to conventionally frozen strawberry halves showed an improved firmness for prolonged storage period and less water loss during thawing maintaining the strawberry tissue integrity. Sensory evaluation confirmed a good organoleptic quality in osmo-dehydrofrozen strawberries.

The success of this effort is marked by the recent regulatory approval of the first QbD filing by the United States Food & Drug Administration (US FDA). Implementation of QbD has been somewhat differently paced in the field of food processing. This is likely due to the significant difference in the regulatory oversight in the two areas, albeit both fall under biotech processing and are governed by the same regulatory agencies. This article aims to achieve two major objectives. First, review the progress that has been made in the recent years on the topic of QbD implementation in processing of food products and biotherapeutics (2010–2015). Second, present case studies to introduce novel technologies and approaches that have the potential of facilitating wide implementation of QbD.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this study was to extract, purify and characterise glycosaminoglycans present in bovine collagen waste liquor. Processing of bovine hides supplies collagen and gelatine to food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries generating abundant and unutilised waste streams that contain bioactive polysaccharides known as glycosaminoglycans. Some of these molecules, like heparin and dermatan sulphate, have known anti-thrombotic and anti-coagulant activities and are prescribed therapeutics. The predominant glycosaminoglycan in bovine collagen waste liquor, dermatan sulphate, was extracted and purified to greater than 93% w/w using only serial filtration and anion exchange chromatography. Bioactivity was measured using an in vitro assay revealing anti-thrombotic activity equivalent to commercial dermatan sulphate sourced from porcine mucosa. Fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis revealed a composition rich in the predominant mammalian disaccharide, uronic acid→N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-4-O-sulphate. Depolymerization and fractionation enriched for low molecular weight fragments with significantly improved anti-thrombotic activity. This study identifies an alternative source of anti-thrombotic dermatan sulphate that can be easily extracted without proteolysis or solvent precipitation that can be further processed into low molecular weight fractions with improved anti-thrombotic activity.",

     "abstract": "The main aim of this work was to obtain experimental data of the extraction kinetics of soybean oil and free fatty acids (FFA) for systems containing an expanded mass of soybean (collets) and ethanol with different hydration levels (0 and 5.98 mass% of water) at temperatures of 40, 50 and 60 °C. Through the obtained experimental data it can be seen that increasing the hydration level of ethanol suppresses the soybean oil extraction but increases the FFA extraction, while the temperature favors the solubility of both fatty compounds. The experimental data were correlated using a model proposed by So and Macdonald (1986. Can. J. Chem. Eng. 64, 80–86), which enables determination of the mass transfer coefficients in the washing and diffusion steps, and a model proposed by Perez et al. (2011. J. Food Eng. 105, 180–185) that enables the estimation of diffusivity coefficients. High values of the coefficient of determination (R2 ≥ 0.9961) and low values of the average relative deviation (ARD ≤ 4.74%) were obtained, showing that the models used were suitable to describe the kinetics of extraction of the oil and minor compounds present in soybean. The value of the diffusivity coefficient for soybean oil increased with increasing temperature and with decreasing hydration level in the solvent, presenting values of 3.61 to 5.36 × 10−11 m2 s−1.",

The experiments were performed by using 10, 20, 50, and 100 kDa commercial UF membranes. Two commercial resins were used in ion exchange experiments. The results of decoloring sugar solution using UF membranes showed that the 20 kDa UF membrane made of polysulfone displays the best performance in term of flux and color removal. Integrating ion exchange process into UF membrane improves the color reduction resulting colorless liquid sugar. The UF–IE configuration shows a better performance than both the IE–UF and UF/IE alone configurations. These results provide important information about technologies that should be used for liquid sugar production.",

A RSM Box–Behnken experimental design was used to evaluate the effect of the temperature (135–175 °C), flow rate (0.7–1.3 mL/min) and solvent to biomass ratio (20–60 mL/g) on the extraction yield of β-glucans and the content in β-glucans of the final product. A dramatic effect of the temperature was observed: the higher the temperature, the higher the extraction yield; however, at temperatures above 158 °C the β-glucan content in the final product began to decrease. It was also seen that experiments longer than 80 min are required to get the β-glucans dissolved. Finally, the effect of the flow rate on the extraction yield was not significant, indicating that external mass transport was not controlling the extraction process. The extraction conditions that maximize both extraction yield of β-glucan (64.9 ± 0.8%) and led to the highest content in β-glucans in the final product (61.7 ± 1.0%) are 158 °C, 1.3 mL/min and 60 mL/g.The addition of supercritical CO2 to the pressurized hot water throughout the extraction (done at 155 °C, 1 mL/min of PHW and 40 mL/g) produced a significant improvement of the extraction yield up to 72.5% in the best tested conditions; effect primarily attributed to the acidification of the media obtained by the supercritical CO2.",

The aqueous seed extract obtained at optimal condition (temperature: 49.2 °C, time: 89.4 min, and liquid to solid ratio: 51.6:1 mL/g) was submitted to cross flow ultrafiltration for initial clarification, followed by concentration using nanofiltration under batch concentration mode. A detailed parametric study was carried out to investigate the effect of various process parameters such as transmembrane pressure, cross-flow velocity (or stirrer speed) on the permeate flux and permeate quality. Using classical film theory, a steady state gel polarization model incorporating the effect of transmembrane pressure difference and viscosity variation was proposed for the prediction of permeate flux during cross flow ultrafiltration of aqueous seed extract. The predicted flux values were successfully compared with the experimental results. Experimental results showed that the operating conditions had significant effect on permeate flux, recovery of polyphenols, purity and antioxidant activity of phenolic extract. Ultrafiltration experiments at lower operating pressures (276 and 414 kPa) using 100 kDa membrane resulted in the recovery of 59–66.7% of total polyphenol content in the clarified extract with the purity of 49–58.3% starting from an extract purity of 39.2%. The clarified extract could be successfully concentrated about three times higher using 250 Da nanofiltration membrane at volume concentration ratio of three.

Ohmic-assisted hydrodistillation (OAHD) is a new proposed extraction method which uses the advantages of ohmic heating and has been used for essential oil separation. In this study, an OAHD device was designed and developed for ethanol distillation using titanium electrodes. Results of the OAHD process were compared to those of traditional hydrodistillation (HD) at constant wattage of 168 W for 3 L of 10% (v/v) ethanol solution containing 0.5% (w/v) sodium chloride as the electrolyte. Results indicated that the required energy for separation of ethanol in OAHD was 33% less than HD. In addition, OAHD completed the distillation process in 75.2 ± 2.2 min while HD required 108.4 ± 5.3 min. The concentrations of ethanol in the final distilled product from both methods were similar (47.3% ± 3.2 for OAHD vs. 50.0% ± 2.6 for HD). Interestingly, in OAHD, process control is faster and distillation can be stopped in seconds and consequently, less unwanted distillate in comparison to HD (0.05% ± 0.01 and 2.28% ± 0.03 of total distilled product, respectively). The findings of this study introduce OAHD as a potentially economical and environmentally friendly method for the ethanol distillation process.",

Rice flour (RF) was dissolved in tap water to reach 311.5 g/l dry matter and then the mixture was simultaneousely liquefied, saccharified, and fermented. Thanks to the addition of a raw starch hydrolyzing enzyme containing a mixture of alpha-amylase and gluco-amylase (Stargen 002 at 991.8 GAU/kg RF), gluco-amylase (Amigase Mega L at 0.035% w/w), protease (Fermgen at 600 SAPU/kg RF), active dry yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Red Ethanol at 3.5 × 107 cells/ml), KH2PO4 (4.8 mM), and urea (16.0 mM). Under these conditions, the SLSF–VHG process finished after 120 h and achieved an ethanol content of 17.6% v/v corresponding to 86.3% of the theoretical ethanol yield. We scaled up this SLSF process at very high gravity at pilot scale (25 l) and achieved an ethanol content of 17.0% v/v corresponding to a yield of 83.2% of the theoretical ethanol yield. Rice-based distillers dried grains (DDG) was produced from the whole stillage of SLSF process at very high gravity by being plate-filtered and dried. The obtained DDG had high contents of crude protein (47.5%) and fibers (15.8%).

Both UF stages were performed at specific processing conditions and determination on the permeate flux values and the extract properties of each UF stage were conducted. Observations were also employed at different feed pH and processing temperatures in both UF stages for processing optimization. Results showed the proposed technique managed to retain 96.8% enzyme recovery in the UF stage 1 and increase the bromelain purity up to 2.5-fold, which is within the targeted purity requirement, in the UF stage 2. The permeate flux values for UF stages 1 and 2 were 11.6 and 6.2 kg/m2 h, respectively. Higher VRF of the process in UF stage 2 leads to higher enzyme purity, thus the process can be adjusted depending on the enzyme final applications.

     "abstract": "In industrial processes, particularly in the food sector, sustainability is increasingly important. Consumers demand safer food and this is often associated with elevated cleaning costs and high environmental impacts in order to reduce contaminations on equipment and products.Modified surfaces are seen as a promising strategy for biofouling mitigation and contamination prevention. In this work, the performance of a modified Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) surface designated by SICON® (a-C:H:Si:O) was compared with stainless steel (316L) regarding bacterial adhesion, biofilm formation and cleanability. Assays were performed at different temperatures using Escherichia coli, one of the most persistent foodborne microorganisms and also the natural flora present in the water from an industrial salad washing line. Bacterial adhesion on SICON® and stainless steel were similar and favored at a higher temperature (30 °C). Biofilm formation was reduced on SICON® (1–2 Log) and this may be explained by the lower ratio between the Lifshitz-van der Waals apolar component and the electron donor component (γLW/γ−) of this surface. It was also shown that after performing a cleaning treatment with chlorine, reduction of viability counts was much higher in SICON® (about 3.5 Log reduction and 15% removal) when compared to stainless steel (1.6 Log reduction and 6% removal). Additionally, it was observed that 18 h after treatment, biofilm values in SICON® were similar to those obtained with stainless steel.Results indicate that for industries with cleaning frequencies of up to 6 h, the use of SICON® on critical areas enables operation at a much higher hygienic level.",

This study evaluates the effect of ACP on the activity and structure of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), an enzyme native to milk. ALP enzyme in solution was treated with ACP at three discreet high voltages (40, 50 and 60 kV) for durations ranging between 15 s and 5 min. Results demonstrated that the dielectric barrier discharge based plasma technology was able to inactivate the enzyme within a few seconds. Kinetic models, namely first order, Weibull and logistic models were fitted to the experimentally observed data and the model parameters were determined. The Weibull model was found to best describe the observed variance in residual activity for all the voltages applied. The dichroic spectra suggested that the enzyme was characterized by a predominance of α-helix structure, and the helical content showed a tendency to decrease with increase in treatment time and voltage. The maximum temperature recorded for most intense treatments was in the order of only 30 °C and no change in pH was noticed.",

     "abstract": "Mechanistic understanding of industrial food-emulsification is necessary for optimal operation and design. Industrial mayonnaise production is yet poorly understood, partly due to a lack of experimental data and partly due to the complexity of the product.This study suggests a systematic method for building mechanistic insight, by investigating successively more complex model emulsions in industrial rotor–stator mixers, comparing to idealized theories identifying points of departure. As a first step, a high volume fraction (>50%) and high viscosity (>100 mPa s) model emulsion with a non-ionic surfactant acting as emulsifier is investigated in two industrial-scale mixers (one batch and one continuous inline mixer) at varying rotor tip-speeds.The resulting drop diameter to rotor tip-speed scaling suggest turbulent viscous fragmentation of the model emulsion in both mixers despite the high volume fraction of disperse phase which could be expected to lead to significant non-idealities such as extensive coalescence and concentration effect-dominated fragmentation. If the other non-idealities (e.g. egg yolk emulsifying system and non-Newtonian rheology) would not influence the emulsification, this suggests the same mechanism for mayonnaise emulsification. An outline for continued work on successively more complex model-emulsions is discussed in order to further enhance understanding.",

The enlargement of anode surface induces an increase of electricity generation (from 4 to 12.5 mA/m2) while the ethanol production decreases. Adding riboflavin to the wort in the MFC results significant increase in electricity production, furthermore it decreases the ethanol synthesis. Addition of 50 μM riboflavin enhances the current output to 51 mA/m2 with a 1.5 V/V% decrease of ethanol production, while 100 μM results 86 mA/m2 and 2 V/V% decrease of ethanol production.

The optimum conditions (50 °C, pH 4.5, enzyme loading 14.47 U/gsucrose with 1 mM CaCl2, undiluted fruit juice concentrates) were applied in apple and orange juice concentrates.

The enzyme was deactivated during standard fruit juice pasteurization conditions (95 °C, 15 s). The oligosaccharides were stable during the pasteurization process, showing a good potential for industrial applications. DOSY NMR analysis of the enzymatically modified fruit juice concentrates showed that α1→6 glycosidic linkages are predominant in apple juice, while products in orange juice possess both α1→6 and α1→3 glycosidic linkages.

The efficiency of the microorganism to produce butanol and other metabolites was explored via carbon balance. Inhibitory effects were minimized by dilution and detoxification method.

Process integration of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), and supercritical antisolvent process (SAS) has been investigated in order to obtain turmeric essential oil (TEO) and powdered curcuminoid-rich extract (PCE). Scale-up led to a decrease in the cost of manufacture (COM) for both the products. Volatile oil and powdered curcuminoid-rich extract COMs decreased from US$ 112.70 kg−1 to US$ 85.58 kg−1 and from US$ 174.80 kg−1 to US$ 141.63 kg−1, respectively, when a raw material costing US$ 7.27 kg−1 was used, and the capacity of the system increased from 2× 50 L to 2× 500 L. The raw material cost had a significant effect on the process expenses. When the capacity of the system was 2× 50 L, and the raw material cost decreased from US$ 7.27 kg−1 to US$ 1.59 kg−1, the COM of volatile oil and powdered curcuminoid-rich extract decreased from US$ 112.70 kg−1 to US$ 64.97 kg−1 and from US$ 174.80 kg−1 to US$ 140.96 kg−1, respectively.

     "abstract": "The relationship between maceration and extraction yield in the production of Chinese herbal medicine has been studied. There is a general belief that swelling of herb tissue by maceration enhances the extraction yield of a chemical marker in the afterward extraction; however, this may not be true in general. The extraction of chrysophanol from a seed grounded into powder, Semen Cassiae, served as an example to show how maceration enhances the extraction yield of a chemical marker. It is possibly due to the fact that there are so many water soluble substances like starch, sugar and protein in seeds. When water is used as the maceration solvent, it dissolves and removes the water soluble substances, and therefore increases the availability of chemical marker to be extracted by the mixture of ethanol and water. In some other cases, it was found that maceration had no effect on the extraction yield of chemical marker, like the extraction of danshesu from Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae (herb of root) and peaonol from Cortex Moutan (herb of root bark). Also, chemical markers may decompose during maceration and extraction, such as extractions of pinoresinol diglucoside from Cortex Eucommiae (herb of stem bark) and chlorogenic acid from Flos Lonicerae (herb of flower), leading to a decrease of the extraction yield. Based on these experimental results, this study provides general considerations to evaluate if it is cost and time effective to carry out maceration in the production process of Chinese herbal medicine. These considerations include whether the chemical marker is stable during maceration, and whether any substance present in the herb would affect extraction and can be removed during maceration.",

These peptides have attracted high research and consumer interests due to their huge potential of use in functional foods and other dietary interventions of disease control and health promotion. However, successful product development is limited by the fact that current manufacturing processes are either difficult to scale up, high in cost, or have the potential to affect the structure-activity properties of these peptides. To overcome these challenges, we have proposed in this review, the use of an integrated ‘-omics’ approach comprising in silico analysis and ‘-omics’ techniques (such as peptidomics) to respectively forecast and validate the biological and physico-chemical properties of the peptides. This information is then used for the rational design of suitable purification steps for peptides of interest. Downstream purification could also be undertaken by liquid chromatography using monolithic adsorbents physico-chemically engineered (using results of in silico analysis) for rapid isolation of peptides. By coupling the high throughput and predictive capability of ‘-omics’ to the enhanced convective hydrodynamics of monolithic columns, it becomes feasible, even at preparative scale, to produce BPs that meet the requirements of high purity, potency, and cost-effectiveness.",

Membranes with different polymeric material (polyethersulphone, polyammide) and molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) (from 200 to 1000 Da) were tested. NF membranes of 200 Da produced better results in terms of recovery and concentration of compounds of interest. A better separation of salt compounds from caffeoylquinic acid derivatives was reached by using Filmtec-Dow NF 200 and Desal DL membranes. For these membranes a low rejection towards dry residue (between 14% and 18%) was observed, while rejections towards total caffeoylquinic acids, flavonoids and cynarin were higher than 92%.According to the obtained results the NF permeate, enriched in salt compounds, can be reused in the working cycle for the preparation of new acidulated brines through the adjustment of the standard salt concentration; the concentrated stream, enriched in phenolic compounds, is a good source of possible ingredients to functionalize foodstuffs.",

Hence, the microwave-assisted extraction of hydrophilic (H) and lipophilic (L) antioxidants from a surplus tomato crop was optimized using response surface methodology. The relevant independent variables were temperature (T), extraction time (t), ethanol concentration (Et) and solid/liquid ratio (S/L). The concentration-time response methods of crocin and β-carotene bleaching were applied, since they are suitable in vitro assays to evaluate the antioxidant activity of H and L matrices, respectively. The optimum operating conditions that maximized the extraction were as follows: t, 2.25 min; T, 149.2 °C; Et, 99.1%; and S/L, 45.0 g/L for H antioxidants; and t, 15.4 min; T, 60.0 °C; Et, 33.0%; and S/L, 15.0 g/L for L antioxidants. This industrial approach indicated that surplus tomatoes possess a high content of antioxidants, offering an alternative source for obtaining natural value-added compounds.

Tomato ketchup with increased content of natural fibre contained 3.18 g/100 g of total dietary fibre. Although the rheological properties of ketchup with increased fibre content depend mostly on total solids and insoluble particles content, they remained in the limits of standard tomato products. The obtained results are encouraging in terms of the applied technological process since it resulted in a product with sensory properties more similar to fresh or slightly processed tomato.

Knowing the role played by these factors can be helpful for further studies in optimization of design parameters of an RF heating process. Therefore, to evaluate effect due to distance between electrodes and projection area during RF heating process, samples of same volume but exhibiting different projection areas were used to determine the variability in their power absorption, temperature change and heating rates. RF electrodes in this system were positioned with a fixed gap between samples’ top–bottom surfaces and the electrodes and, case by case, at different distance between electrodes. The results indicated that both parameters have strong effect on power absorption, temperature distribution, heating rates and heating uniformity in the samples, which is further amplified when it is combined with the change of dielectric properties with temperature. In the investigated range, wider projection area and shorter distance between electrodes led to faster heating, in terms of average temperature, but less uniform temperature distribution, at least in the early stage of the RF heating process, before the changes in dielectric properties of the heated load started modifying the trend of the loss tangent and penetration depth. The results of this study are expected to be used in planning geometrical configuration and design parameters of RF systems and sample dimensions for further optimization studies.",

Assays were performed at industrial and laboratory scale. Results showed that lower doses of chlorine from NEOW (30 ppm) are as effective as higher concentrations of the traditional chlorine from NaOCl (80 ppm) in the reduction of total microbial population at industrial scale. Moreover, in laboratory studies, the NEOW chlorine was also more effective in biofilm eradication, as well as a biofilm preventive agent. NEOW can thus be a successful alternative water disinfection technique, reducing the free chlorine concentration needed to sanitize salads, also decreasing water consumption whilst taking into account environmental and food quality impacts.",

     "abstract": "A porous biochar was manufactured through the valorization of waste pork bones, following a three-step process including pre-charring under mild conditions, acid treatment and thermal activation. The influence of the acid (H2SO4 and H3PO4) and the impregnation ratio on the physicochemical properties of the material was investigated. Acid treatment at 0.2 mmolacid/gprecursor increased BET area by about 80%, compared to untreated bone char. When using H2SO4, higher impregnation ratios significantly enhanced microporosity (up to 263%). This increased microporosity should be associated to a specific reaction mechanism of H2SO4 with a source of carbon. On the contrary, the higher activity of H3PO4 led to a dramatic removal of porosity for large impregnation ratios (about 20 mmol/g). The acid activation mechanism involves the formation of cation-deficient HAp, which is thereafter decomposed upon thermal treatment. The maximum uptake of methylene blue was achieved at low impregnation ratios (0.2 and 1.0 mmol/g), and could be related to surface area corresponding to large micropores and small mesopores.",

Evaporative crystallization is the process where both concentration and crystallization occur simultaneously. There is no current literature on an industrial scale evaporative crystallizer producing lactose monohydrate. Crystal size is the most important output parameter for the lactose crystallization process. In order to understand the effect of various operational and kinetic parameters on the final crystal size coming out of the crystallizer, a mathematical model was developed to mimic the operation of the industrial unit. The model includes mass and crystal population balances along with mutarotation and nucleation kinetics for lactose. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by simulating the developed model for a range of values for parameters like residence time, evaporation rate, crystallizer temperature and growth and nucleation kinetics. It was found that the secondary nucleation rate was the factor most affecting the crystal size. The crystal size and dissolved lactose data from the industrial unit were collected and fitted to the model predictions to estimate the crystallization kinetics of lactose in the industrial unit. Based on the simulation results, operational and design guidelines for an evaporative crystallizer were laid down.",

Physical and antimicrobial characterization of film-forming emulsion and films were developed. Results showed differences in rheological behavior, particle size and stability of emulsions by encapsulating type. The highest stability of emulsions containing Tween 20 (instability of 0.69%) was attributed to more interactions between components (observed by FTIR) and the lowest particle size, but other samples also showed high stability (instability <5%). The stability of emulsions did not correlate with films microstructure indicating that interactions amount components changed when solvent was evaporated. Films containing trehalose and β-cyclodextrin had less color and opacity than Tween 20, which is an advantage by industrial applications by coating due cannot affect the organoleptic characteristics of a fresh product.

     "abstract": "Reciprocating agitation thermal processing (RA-TP) is a recent addition to the container agitation mechanisms available to reduce quality loss during canning. Data on heat transfer coefficients associated with RA-TP of canned particulates in Newtonian fluid were used to develop dimensionless correlations for predictive modeling of RA-TP. Developed correlations were validated against data from processing of non-Newtonian liquid-particulate mixtures. Effect of container orientation was included in the correlations by considering the aspect ratio (AR) of can. Sums of amplitude with container's axial dimension (A + Daxis) and particle diameter (A + Dp) were found most suitable as characteristic length in correlations for overall (U) and fluid-to-particle (hfp) heat transfer coefficient, respectively. Gr/Re2 (0.01–4.46 and 0.02–6.86 for U and hfp, respectively) during RA-TP was lower than those during other modes of agitation, suggesting predominance of forced convection during RA-TP. However, mixed-convection model gave better R2 (0.93–0.95) than pure-forced-convection model, suggesting mixed convection scenario under mild agitation conditions. Developed correlations fitted well for data from non-Newtonian fluid mixtures on replacing the viscosity term with apparent viscosity of non-Newtonian fluid. It was also seen that Sauter mean diameter can be used to approximate the effect of varying particle shapes and sizes in the developed correlations.Industrial Significance: Reciprocating agitation of containers is receiving interest from thermal processing industry for enhancing product quality. The aim of this study was to develop dimensionless correlations for predictive modeling of heat transfer coefficients to be used in computational programs for process establishment and validation. Additionally, importance of natural convection in forced convection heat transfer correlations has been demonstrated by developing the U and hfp correlations using the mixed convection approach as the combination of natural and forced convection heat transfer. This study also analyzes the applicability of developed correlations for real foods which may be of non-Newtonian nature and of varying shapes and sizes. The developed correlations would be useful for modeling the time–temperature profiles of a canned particulate mixture and will be helpful in determining the contribution of natural and forced convection heat transfer. These dimensional numbers would give a better understanding of the physical phenomenon and can also be easily used for scale-up purposes.",

The OD model is able to represent situations where concentration of osmotic media changes during the process or where interfacial resistance to mass transfer cannot be neglected. Water and solute are considered to move within the product by a diffusion mechanism based on Fick's second law, while external convective mass transfer is considered in the fluid. The state-space form of the model is analytically solved for one-dimensional mass transfer in products with flat slab, infinite cylinders and sphere geometries. The developed theory was applied to the analysis of equilibrium and OD dehydration curves of carrot slices obtained at 40 °C in sodium chloride solutions with and without stirring and different ratios between solution volume and product mass. Water and NaCl diffusivities were identified in the narrow ranges of 6.0–7.6 × 10−10 m2/s and 3.5–4.1 × 10−10 m2/s, respectively, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed model under a wide range of operating conditions.",

Around 30–40% of glycerol as plasticizer was required to obtain good processability of PPI/GL blends to produce bioplastics. A mixing rheometer that allows recording of torque and temperature during mixing and a small-scale-plunger-type injection moulding machine were used to obtain PPI/GL blends and PPI-based bioplastics, respectively. Rheological and differential scanning calorimetry measurements were made to guide the selection of suitable conditions for injection and moulding. For injection, we selected a temperature relatively close to the maximum of the loss tangent, but moderate enough to avoid crosslinking effects (50 °C), and for moulding, a high temperature (130 °C) to favour crosslinking in the mould. An increase in the PPI/GL ratio leads to an enhancement of elastic bending and tensile properties of bioplastic specimens, as well as an increase in their ability to absorb mechanical energy before rupturing. On the other hand, the PPI/GL specimens become less transparent. In addition, water uptake of these bioplastics has been found to be very high and fast.",

The quality of the dried durian chips was considered in terms of colour, percentage of shrinkage, texture and microstructure. The energy utilization of the drying system was evaluated in terms of the specific energy consumption (SEC). The results showed that MWHA drying provided a higher drying rate than MWVC and HA drying. The drying rate increased with an increase in the microwave power and a decrease in pressure, which led to a shorter drying time. However, the microwave power level had more effect on the drying rate than the pressure level. High microwave power also produced dried products with low lightness, shrinkage and hardness values, but more crispy and with large pore sizes. Dried durian chips from the combined microwave techniques had higher lightness and crispness values and more porous structure with larger void area fraction but less shrinkage and hardness than those dried by HA. The combined microwave techniques gave lower specific energy consumption (SEC) than HA drying, and the SEC decreased with an increase in microwave power. The overall preference of dried durian chips from MWHA was higher than that from MWVC but lower than that of commercial fried durian chips.",

     "abstract": "This work studied the change of the hydration behavior of Adzuki beans (Vigna angularis) as a function of their initial moisture content. By studying the hydration kinetics at different initial moisture contents, it was demonstrated that the hydration behavior of this grain changes from the sigmoidal to the downward concave shape (DCS) when the initial moisture content is above ∼20% d.b. This change happens when the moisture content passes from zone II to zone III of the grain's adsorption isotherm. This was attributed to the transition from the glassy state to the rubbery state, especially the in seed coat components. The seed coat is impermeable when the moisture content of the grain is low, so the water ingress is only by way of the hilum. However, when the seed coat is above ∼20% d.b. the water enters not only via the hilum, but also by way of the seed coat. The hydration behavior of the grain was modeled using a sigmoidal mathematical model, whose parameters were evaluated as a function of the initial moisture content; the water absorption rate parameter demonstrated a sigmoidal increasing behavior. The time to reach the inflexion point of the curve, related to the lag phase, showed an exponential decay. The equilibrium moisture content was not affected. Finally, a general model, which was able to predict the moisture content as a function of the initial moisture content of the grain and the process time, was obtained.",

     "abstract": "Spray-drying of double (DE) and multilayered (ME) fish oil emulsions, was used to produce two different types of microcapsules (DM and MM, respectively). Stability of emulsions and physicochemical characteristics, oxidative stability and volatile profile of the microcapsules at initial time and after 1 month of storage at 20 and 4 °C were analyzed. ME showed better stability and held higher amount of fish oil than DE (2.5 vs 0.625% w/w). Microencapsulation yield was similar for both types, whereas moisture, microencapsulation efficiency and oxidative stability were higher for MM. The type of microcapsule influenced the volatile profile and specifically the 28 selected volatiles related to oxidation. Both types of microcapsules appear as feasible alternatives to the bulk fish oil as a way to provide ω-3 storage and for enrichment purposes, but MM seems to be more appropriate in terms of oxidation during storage.",

Thermo-compression has not been analysed in multi-effect food evaporator systems. For this study, an evaporation system for milk using thermo-compression was analysed. The proposed software, FEVAT (falling-film evaporation design), considers the optimization of the cost of the evaporation system and an iterative method to solve the balances of material and energy, design equations and a thermo-compression model. The FEVAT interface introduces thermo-physical properties of the foodstuff in function of composition and temperature. In order to determine the influence of the thermo-compression parameters in the simulation, a series of numerical experiments was proposed whereby the thermodynamic efficiency of the thermo-compressor, source of the steam recycling and the effect percent of recycle were varied, one by one. The results showed that the economy of evaporation is proportional to the percentage of steam recycling and the position of the effect that recycles the steam and inverse to the thermodynamic efficiency of the thermo-compressor. In this study the limiting conditions of the operation of the thermo-compressor were obtained that can be applied to other evaporation systems with different foodstuffs.",

The designed plant included acid hydrolysis of peels, filtration of the hydrolyzed suspension, alcoholic precipitation of pectin, gel pressing, gel drying, and pectin size reduction. Calculations of processing times and size of units were done with Microsoft Excel® and Aspen Plus v7.3®. Characteristic dead times in the precipitation stage of the conventional processes were eliminated by implementing two out-of-phase hydrolysis stages, which lowers the batch size and the dimensions of hydrolysis tanks; this is an important improvement given the technical difficulties that may arise when handling large amounts (e.g., above 1 ton) of highly-viscous suspensions (e.g., above 100 cP), such as those present in the hydrolysis stage of pectin extraction. Up to 76% ethanol recovery was achieved by means of the operation of a continuous distillation column. Furthermore, rheological behavior of the liquid obtained from the hydrolysis of orange peels in acidic media, as well as the drying of pectin gels was modeled in this contribution. In particular, the rheological analysis allowed a more realistic estimation of energy demands for heat transfer and agitation in the hydrolysis stage, which resulted to be the process bottleneck and determined the cycle time and, consequently, defined the equipment size.",

     "abstract": "Ethyl-lactate (ethyl 2-hydroxy-propanoate) is a bio-renewable agrochemical solvent, very suitable and environmental benign for food applications, permitted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as pharmaceutical and food additive. In previous work, the authors demonstrated that pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) using ethyl lactate is a suitable alternative to remove caffeine from vegetal materials, e.g. green coffee beans and green tea leaves. The solubility of caffeine in ethyl lactate + water mixtures, at ambient temperature and pressure, exhibits a substantial increase for 60:40% ethyl lactate + water mixtures (data reported in this work). This result motivated the analysis of the effect of the ethyl lactate + water mixtures for the decaffeination target.Furthermore, in the case of green tea, the removal of caffeine reducing the extraction of catechins is desirable due to the adverse effects of caffeine on health, while catechins are high valued functional food ingredients. Thus, the use of ethyl lactate, water and ethyl lactate + water mixtures to attain this objective, i.e. the removal of caffeine form green tea leaves minimizing the extraction of catechins, was studied in this work.PLE was carried out in the temperature range 373–473 K and using different ethyl lactate + water mixtures. Extraction yield and recovery of key bioactive compounds (caffeine and monomeric catechins) were determined and compared, and the caffeine/catechins selectivity of the different solvents employed was estimated.High extraction yields were obtained with a mixture containing 25:75% of ethyl lactate + water, with values around 1.5 and 3.5 times higher than, respectively, the yields obtained with water and ethyl lactate. Yet, pure ethyl lactate proved to be the most selective solvent to extract caffeine from green tea leaves, minimizing the co-extraction of catechins, with a caffeine/catechins selectivity of 2.8 to 5.5 in the range 373–423 K. At these temperatures, with short extraction times (20 min) the recovery of caffeine is in the range 53–76% but only 26–36% of catechins present in the tea leaves were removed.",

However, the degradation was much less when the encapsulated powder was stored at low temperature in the absence of air and light.

The inactivation of Salmonella spp. by means of different irradiation doses was modeled using a first order kinetics. The shelf-life was studied by periodically counting the bacterial number in samples. For the modeling of experimental data, only the exponential phase of growth was taken into account. The effect of the irradiation dose on the sensory attributes (appearance, odor and flavor) and instrumental color (L*, a* and b* parameters) was modeled using the Gompertz function and the Activation–Inactivation or linear models. The optimization of the irradiation dose was carried out by maximizing the sensory scores of samples and minimizing the instrumental color changes. The safety and the shelf-life of samples were ensured by introducing constraints into the optimization problem. In the case of hamburgers, the optimum calculated dose was 2.04 kGy, which guarantees the safety of the product and provides the best combination of sensory and instrumental attributes. As regards the steaks, the optimum assessed dose was 1.11 kGy, significantly lower than for hamburgers.",

Considering the use of agro byproduct as economic and environmental benefits, biotranformation of Potato pulp powder by solid state fermentation for the production of acid protease a valuable food enzyme is explored. Screening of food grade and industrial Aspergillus oryzae strains on enriched media identified A. oryzae RIB 40 (ATCC 42149) yielding 20.5 U/ml of acid protease as a potential candidate. Further, the productivity of the parent strain was improved by UV mutagenesis with a lethality of 1.8 × 10−4. The mutant strain (F6) produced 5.6 fold higher than the parent. The solid state fermentation of A. oryzae (F6) with potato pulp powder as a sole source and along with supplementation of nitrogen yielded 2.85 ± 5.0 and 18.68 U/g of acid protease, respectively. Statistical optimization of biovariables, namely moisture (50%), temperature (30 °C) and fermentation time (120 h) accomplished using a central composite rotatable experimental design, led to an 11-fold increase in protease activity (31 U/g dry substrate). Model validations indicated 95% agreement between the experimental results and the predicted responses. The acid protease from A. oryzae liberated glycine (0.57 ± 0.25 U/g), which can enhance food palatability. Thus, the present study established fermenting potato pulp, with a starter culture of A. oryzae F6 strain and optimized variables can produce acid protease that has great potential for use in the food industry.

Use of a submerged membrane reactor has been investigated for continuous enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose thus allowing for greater use of the enzyme compared to a batch process. The submerged 0.65 μm polyethersulfone microfiltration membrane avoids the need to pump a cellulose slurry through an external loop. Permeate containing glucose is withdrawn at pressures slightly below atmospheric pressure. The membrane rejects cellulose particles and cellulase enzyme bound to cellulose. Here proof-of-concept experiments have been conducted using a modified, commercially available membrane filtration cell under low fluxes around 75 L/(m2 h). The operating flux is determined by the rate of glucose production. Maximizing the rate of glucose production involves optimizing mixing, reactor holding time, and the time the feed is held in the reactor prior to commencement of membrane filtration and continuous operation. Maximizing glucose production rates will require operating at low glucose concentration in order to minimize the adverse effects of product inhibition. Consequently practical submerged membrane systems will require a combined sugar concentration step in order to concentrate the product sugar stream prior to fermentation.",

The characterization of CRL-MWCNTs nanoconjugates using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Field Scanning Electron Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy revealed successful attachment of CRL onto the F-MWCNTs. Utilization of CRL-MWCNTs nanoconjugates resulted in a higher acid conversion in the synthesis of methyl oleate (79.85% at 11 h of reaction time) when compared with the free CRL i.e. an approximately 1.5-fold improvement over the free CRL.

A quantitative comparison of the pre-culture method for producing pigments by P. purpurogenum GH2 is provided in this work.

In this work, Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) was immobilized onto silica nanoparticles and its activity and enantioselectivity in organic solvent were evaluated at high pressures under different water activities. The application of high hydrostatic pressures (50–200 MPa) led to improved activities of immobilized CRL for transesterification of (R)-1-phenylpropan-2-ol with vinyl acetate by 4–6 folds. Additionally the immobilization of CRL resulted in a significant change of selectivities, shifting the enantiomeric excess from the (R)- towards (S)-1-phenylpropan-2-yl acetate product at atmospheric pressure. The application of high pressures led to either enantiomeric excess towards (R)-1-phenylpropan-2-yl or no enantiomeric selectivity, depending on the water activities in the organic solvent and the level of pressures. The interesting behaviour of immobilized CRL under high pressures offers new opportunities to modulate enzyme functions through combination of high pressures and enzyme immobilization.",

The scope of this study is to select a nanofiltration (NF) technique to reduce the alcohol content of wines approximately 2° by controlling the sugar content of grape must before its fermentation.For this purpose the performance of single-stage and two-stage NF processes using a spiral wound membrane unit were compared for white must (Spanish Verdejo) while for red must (Spanish Garnacha) a two-stage procedure was tested. During the single-stage NF intermittent backflush due to the osmotic pressure effect was tested. Results showed that backflushing had an undesirable effect because it increased the flux decay by disturbing the cake stabilization on the membrane. The corresponding wines obtained by adequate mixing of permeated and retained or control musts showed a 1–2° alcohol reduction. Sensory evaluation and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that there were no significant differences between the control and the filtered wines. Among the processes studied, the best NF technique was the two-stage process without backflush.",

Aiming at the concentration of lycopene, the performance of two ultrafiltration (UF) membranes was evaluated, one made of polysulfone with 100 kDa (PS 100) and other polyetersulfone with 50 kDa (PES 50), in different conditions of pressure and tangential velocity. The use of raw or enzymatically hydrolyzed papaya pulp was also evaluated. In addition, diafiltration experiments were carried out with the purpose of obtaining a purified lycopene retentate. The permeation curves showed typical behavior of UF processes. In the studied operational conditions and for the two membranes tested, lycopene retention was higher than 90%. The enzymatic treatment of the raw material had no significant effect on the permeate flux. The best UF performance was obtained with the PS 100 membrane, pressure 1 bar and tangential velocity 6 m s−1.

Microwave drying of different sized spheres is carried out in a domestic microwave oven operating at 10% power level. Maxwell's equations for electromagnetics are solved inside a three dimensional (3D) microwave oven to obtain the electric field distribution inside the oven cavity and the spheres. The drying samples are treated as a porous media consisting of three phases: solid (skeleton), liquid (water) and gas (water vapor and air). Modes of transport for the fluid phases include capillary flow, binary diffusion between vapor and air, gas pressure driven flow and phase change between liquid water and vapor which is spatially distributed. An elaborate experimental system comprising of infrared camera, optical fiber probe and digital balance is built to validate the model in terms of temperature distribution, point temperatures, gas pressure generation and moisture loss from the samples at different times during the drying process. Results, validation, sensitivity analysis and “what-if” scenarios are presented in the companion paper.

Microwave energy absorption, temperature, pressure and moisture distribution were obtained in 3D samples to gain a comprehensive understanding of the process and address issues such as overheating resulting from microwave focusing. The model was validated against key process parameters and good agreement was found between experimental data and predicted values. The model and experiments demonstrated that the different sized spheres behaved quite differently under similar conditions of drying and general guidelines were obtained for drying sphere-shaped materials. Intermediate sized spheres were found to be more prone to excessive volumetric heating via focusing of microwave energy compared with larger sized spheres. This led to their explosion midway through the drying process; whereas, smaller sized spheres underwent uniform, low temperature drying without any quality loss. Sensitivity analysis showed that the model was highly sensitive to the mass transfer coefficient of the surrounding air inside the microwave oven while intrinsic permeability did not affect moisture loss from the material. This indicated that capillary diffusion is the dominant mode of transport in small sized spheres. Development of this physics-based model would go a long way in making and improving computer-aided design and optimization of microwave drying processes.",

     "abstract": "To ensure effective enzyme transfer and energy saving, the mixing control is a key issue for efficient hydrolysis of lignocellulose at high solid loading. The effect of agitation on enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated corncob was investigated in this work. Cellulase was obviously deactivated under the agitated condition in the absence of substrate. Increasing from 0 rpm to 150 rpm, high agitation rates increased initial hydrolysis rates and final sugar concentration. However, the excessively high agitation rate at 200 rpm had a significant negative effect on hydrolysis efficiency at the solid loadings from 2% to 15%. Rapid mixing was required only to promote cellulase diffusion within the first 6 h of hydrolysis; afterwards, a smaller mixing energy was required to maintain high hydrolysis efficiency. Based on the hydrolysis rates at different agitation rates, a control strategy with stepwise reduction in agitation rates was proposed. After 72 h of hydrolysis, the glucose yield (54.92 g/L) using the optimal strategy approached that using high-rate continuous agitation (57.34 g/L) at a solid loading of 10% and was greater than those using low-rate continuous agitation. Thus, the stepwise reduction of agitation rate could be beneficial because it could save energy while producing a high sugar concentration, especially for a high solid loading reaction system.",

The rejection toward compounds of interest was evaluated. On the basis of experimental results, an integrated membrane process for the treatment of Nejayote was proposed. The conceptual process design permitted to achieve three streams as valuable products: a fraction enriched in carbohydrates, a fraction with high content of calcium components and clear fraction enriched in phenolic compounds. The obtained solution enriched in carbohydrates is of interest for preparing formulations to be used in food industry. Besides, the solution enriched in polyphenols can be used in cosmetic or pharmaceutical applications.

Airflow rates, between 0.40 and 3.00 vvm, were tested. In all experiments, the fungal growth was almost uniform throughout the solids. Fungi grew both on and within the substrate and fungal cakes were formed. The highest glucoamylase and protease activities were recorded as 130.8 U/g bread (db) and 80.3 U/g bread (db) in the experiments with 1.50 vvm airflow rate, respectively. These values are 27.2% and 32.3% higher than the glucoamylase and protease activities obtained in petri dish experiments with static air. At 1.50 vvm airflow rate, the dry weight of the solids had decreased to 46% of the initial value at the end of the fermentation. The temperature of the solids increased up to 37.5 °C with high axial temperature gradients due to high metabolic activity. The average moisture content of the solids first decreased to 150% (db) and then increased to 275% (db) by the end of the fermentation. Both above and below 1.50 vvm airflow rate, enzyme production and fungal growth were affected significantly. Also, a Gaussian-based mathematical model was developed to model the effects of airflow rate on enzyme production. The model fitted almost seamlessly to the experimental data. Thus, this study clearly showed the effects of aeration on glucoamylase and protease production from waste bread under solid state fermentations.",

This study reports a simple method to produce a protein microencapsulate for carrying nutrients such as vitamins in food preparations. The protein used in this study was isolated from chickpeas. Based on the amphoteric property of the protein, folate (vitamin B9) was encapsulated efficiently from a homogenous protein folate solution mixture, by acidification to the isoelectric point of the protein to obtain the microencapsulate. This yielded a free flowing powder after freeze drying. The encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity were calculated to be 62.19 ± 2.05% and 10.18 ± 0.89%, respectively. The release of the folate was monitored at pH values ranging from 2 to 8. In all cases gradual release was observed.

     "abstract": "In this paper, drying of button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) slices with an innovative drying technique of hot air combined with Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) drying process was investigated at three electrode gaps (5, 6, and 7 cm) and voltage levels (17, 19, and 21 kV). The effects of different hot air combined with EHD drying treatments on the temperature of the mushroom slices, drying time, final color and protein denaturation features including enthalpy (ΔH), onset temperature (To), peak transition temperature (Tp), conclusion temperature (Tc), and temperature range (Tc–To) of endothermic peaks were systematically evaluated. In addition, water state changes in DSC cooling thermograms of dried mushroom slices were investigated. The results obtained by differential scanning calorimetry showed that the ΔH values in the DSC traces of the EHD-dried mushroom slices were reduced with a decrease in the electrode gap and an increase in the voltage. Specifically, among voltages of 21, 17, and 19 kV, a voltage of 21 kV resulted in the lowest ΔH and Tc–To values and the highest Tp and To values. This result indicated that voltage had a significant effect on these responses. Similarly, the DSC results showed a considerable effect of high electric field intensity on ΔH, Tc–To and Tp responses related to protein denaturation in comparison to low electric field intensity.",

However, there are no known studies concerning processed yacon roots. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential prebiotic activity of yacon tuber flour. For this purpose, an aqueous extract was tested for selection of yacon incorporation and sterilization method and selection of the most favourable concentration to be tested for prebiotic activity. Once these conditions were identified, the potential prebiotic activity of the yacon extract was evaluated by determination of viable cell numbers and metabolic activity against four probiotic strains, namely, Enterococcus faecium 32, Bifidobacterium animalis Bo, Lactobacillus acidophilus Ki and Lactobacillus casei L26). Results showed that the best incorporation and sterilization method was to autoclave the supernatant, resultant from the yacon tuber flour suspension, at 121 °C for 20 min and add it to sterilized basal medium. For the confirmation of potential prebiotic activity, de Man–Rogosa–Sharpe (MRS) medium without a conventional carbon source (negative control), with 2% (w/v) glucose per se (positive control) and associated with 1% (w/v) yacon tuber flour were chosen. Yacon tuber flour revealed a potential prebiotic activity upon the growth of the probiotic strains tested, probably due to its fructooligosaccharides (FOS) content.",

The optimized pre-treatments were applied to other modes of drying such as HAD and various combination-drying (CD) schedules involving a decrease in FD phase followed by an increase in HAD phase. The dried crisp product obtained from various drying schedules was evaluated for rehydration characteristics, shrinkage, textural properties, color values, and overall acceptability. The extent of shrinkage was 8–50% in case of FD and HAD procedures respectively. The optimized CD protocol resulted in a product comparable in quality to the freeze-dried samples. The combination-dried jackfruit bulbs have a potential for commercialization because of the product quality being equivalent to freeze-dried ones.",

An increase in the molar mass of the polymer promoted the expansion of the two-phase region and caused the migration of the lactoferrin to the salt-rich bottom phase. An increase in pH also led to the expansion of the biphasic region. However, changing the pH over the tested range slightly affected protein partitioning. Lactoferrin recovery percentages greater than 94% were observed for all of the systems evaluated. The results indicated that lactoferrin can be successfully partitioned in an aqueous two-phase system formed of 14% (w/w) PEG and 10% (w/w) sodium citrate at pH 5.5 and 25 °C.

Developing an efficient method for the separation and recovery of XOS from the prehydrolyzates would provide an excellent opportunity for the better utilization of the cellulosic material and for value-added co-product production. In this study, we investigated the use of centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) for the fractionation of XOS from Miscanthus × giganteus (M × G). During autohydrolysis of miscanthus biomass at 180 °C for 20 min, 63% of xylan was converted into XOS and xylose. The ensuing XOS concentrate contained up to 30% of XOS, which were distributed as 15.9% xylobiose (DP2), 5.9% xylotriose, (DP3), 5.6% xylotetraose (DP4), 0.8% xylopentaose (DP5) and 0.6% xylohexaose (DP6). The XOS concentrate was further fractionated by CPC with a solvent system composed of 4:1:4 (v/v/v) butanol:methanol:water. Using CPC techniques, 230 mg (80%) of DP2 to DP6 oligomers were fractionated from 1 g of XOS concentrate.

This understanding can be certainly improved through direct visual observation. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to analyze mass transfer phenomena that develop during oil immersion by using glass micromodels partially submerged in oil (190 °C), to visualize the mechanisms responsible for moisture loss and oil absorption within a matrix, as well as the effect of gravity, for the first time, using three different configurations (g = 0, g < 0, and g > 0). Moisture and oil profiles were imaged during the frying process in order to obtain water and oil saturation maps. Drying and oil curves were constructed using image analysis, and fractal analysis was performed to describe the morphology of the evaporation and oil fronts. If g < 0 (open side of the micromodel at the bottom) drying times were shorter and gravity tended to destabilize the drying front, which had a mean fractal dimension of 1.818 ± 0.032 that was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those obtained in other set-ups. Largely, evaporation fronts tended to take the form of temperature profiles as reflected by infrared thermal imaging. The morphology of the advancing oil fronts was similar in all configurations. However, g severely affected oil content. When g = 0, less oil was absorbed with a final oil saturation of 32%. In all configurations the air inlet was a key factor to stop oil suction. This occurred even though enough oil could still remain on the surface. Overall, these results may help scientists to describe the physical mechanisms that develop during oil immersion and help presenting an interesting approach that may be used in other fields.",

Evaluation was made of the effects of operational conditions on the production of protease by a selected strain of Aspergillus oryzae, cultivated under solid-state fermentation (SSF) with canola cake as a sole carbon source in an instrumented lab-scale bioreactor. Statistical experimental design revealed that the air flow rate, inlet air relative humidity, and initial substrate moisture content had significant effects on the efficiency of protease production. The highest protease production by A. oryzae was achieved at a fixed air flow rate of 12 mL/min, with inlet air relative humidity within the range 66–94% and initial substrate moisture content between 30% and 40%. The enzymatic extract produced under the selected conditions was spray dried using different concentrations of additives (glucose, maltodextrin, and CMC). The stability of the dried enzymatic powder during shelf storage was evaluated over a period of 90 days. There was a positive effect of CMC and a negative effect of glucose on protease activity and stability, while the influence of maltodextrin was negative in enzyme recovery at time zero, but it was positive on protease stability over a longer period. The spray dried proteolytic enzymatic formulation obtained from SSF of canola cake using A. oryzae has potential for applications in the industrial sector.",

     "abstract": "Cassava root and starch are used for human food consumption, animal feed and raw material for various industries, including the renewable energy industry. The composition and structure of cassava root depend on variety, age, environmental conditions and planting season. Starch granules following rasping step are divided into free and bound starch; the latter remains in the pulp and is difficult to separate, while the former is not bound inside the pulp complex structure. In a starch extractor, cassava starch granules are separated from pulp through the mechanisms of centrifugation and filtration. This research aimed to study the effects of particle size and variety of cassava root, centrifugation and filtration mechanisms on free starch granule separation efficiency. Three cassava root varieties, Rayong 9, Rayong 11 and Kasetsart 50, were classified by particle size after grinding and sieving. Experiments were conducted at various relative centrifugal forces (RCF: 0–487 × G) and pressure drops (2.5–12.0 kPa). The free starch separation efficiency increased with decreasing particle size of all cassava root varieties. The grinding of cassava root into small pieces caused cell wall breakage, facilitating free starch separation from the pulp. As the RCF increased, some bound starch granules were released due to the force acting on the cassava pulp. The pressure drop in filtration process drove the free starch granules to pass through the screen although this force was insufficient to separate the bound starch granules from the fiber.",

Results were compared with conventional techniques used in essential oil isolation.

Raffinate exhausted by SFE could be suitable for further processing, and it was subjected to ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of moderately polar and polar fraction of polyphenolic compounds. Results showed that ethanolic extracts had higher antioxidant activity than water extracts for all CS mean particle sizes.

Shear stress, nutrient load and surface material are important variables affecting the biofilm onset in industry. In this work, the combined impacts of these variables were assessed using three different materials (glass, copper and stainless steel), two nutrient loads (high and low nutrient medium) and two hydrodynamic conditions (static and dynamic). Initial adhesion and biofilm formation were studied in microplates using Escherichia coli as a model organism.Surface material was the factor with the strongest impact and adhesion/biofilm formation were correlated with surface hydrophobicity. However, the impact of this variable was dependent on the nutrient load and imposed shear stress. It was also found that, for the majority of the situations tested, initial attachment performance is a good predictor of biofilm formation behaviour and that the effects observed during attachment are amplified during biofilm maturation. Since shear stress is a major determinant in cell adhesion, the results of this study may find application in industrial systems operating at flow rates between 0.001 and 600 m3 h−1 depending on tube material and diameter.",

     "abstract": "Refractance Window™ (RW™) drying is a novel drying technique in which the material to be dried is placed on a thin plastic sheet and, the plastic sheet is heated from below via circulating hot water. Current understanding suggests that the use of a thin plastic sheet that is transparent to infrared radiation (IR) creates a “window” for thermal radiation from hot water to the wet material. This “window” gradually closes as the material dries out cutting off thermal radiation and prevents the sample to reach water bath temperatures. It is suggested that radiation heat transfer is one of the dominant modes of heat transfer that promotes faster drying. However, no mathematical model-based mechanistic understanding of this process is available to support the above hypotheses, which is the objective of the present work. A conjugate heat and mass transfer model is developed to simulate the drying of pumpkin slices and investigate in particular the effect of the optical properties of a commonly used plastic sheet (Mylar®) on the radiative component of heat transfer. Computed results indicate that there is only a 5% increase in transmission of IR radiation through Mylar between a dry and wet product. A major portion of thermal energy is transferred via conduction (99%) through the plastic sheet. The relatively low sample temperature observed for RW™ drying of thin samples is attributed to the development of a dried, thermally resistive layer at the base that prevents heat transfer from the plastic sheet during the later portions of the drying process. However, for thick-sized samples, the low sample temperature is a result of development of air spaces between the product and the plastic sheet, which reduces the heat flux from the hot water. As a consequence, quality of the final product is preserved when compared with other drying techniques.",

Single-component equilibrium data of both compounds were well described by the Langmuir equation for five selected adsorbents. Two most suitable adsorbents, which were both non-functionalised poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) resins with different pore structures, were then used in measurements of the binary adsorption equilibrium of 2-phenylethanol and l-phenylalanine. The modified competitive Langmuir equation and the LeVan–Vermeulen equation provided good description of co-adsorption of 2-phenylethanol and l-phenylalanine in a broad concentration range of both components when high capacity and selectivity for 2-phenylethanol binding was observed. In order to obtain data for characterization of desorption performance, adsorption isotherms of 2-phenylethanol were also determined for pure ethanol and ethanol/water solutions as solvents.",

Tragacanth gum was included in the formulation for its well-known hydrophilic character, as possible future applications of these bioplastics may be moisture dependent (e.g. modified atmosphere packaging). Moreover, properties of bioplastics stored at room temperature under no control of relative humidity were different of those obtained when bioplastics were equilibrated a 53% relative humidity (RH) atmosphere. This is reflected in the DMTA and tensile tests results, for which water loss in the samples with the highest water contents (1:3, 0:1) involves very significant increases in viscoelastic moduli and tensile strength when equilibrated at 53% RH. Glycerol presence when no RH control was taken promotes water uptake, probably due to an interaction between both plasticizers, which eventually lead to a greater plastic region in the tensile tests.",

Alternatively, cossettes were preheated at 80 °C for 10 min before pressing to produce the thermal juice.A lime-carbonation process was applied for the purification of raw expressed juices. The influences of lime quantity (varied from 0 to 15 kg/m3) on the filterability and the quality of juices were investigated. It was shown that the filtration kinetics of cold PEF juice is faster than that of thermal juice leading to lower values of filtration coefficient Fk and specific filter cake resistance α. Analysis showed that thin juices obtained after purification of PEF juices presents better qualitative characteristics than those obtained from thermal expressed juices. For instance, at the optimal lime quantity (10 kg/m3), the purified PEF juice was less coloured (540 vs. 1360 IU), less turbid and had less proteins and colloids leading to a higher juice purity (0.961 vs. 0.945) comparatively to the purified thermal juice.",

Ultrasonic cell lysis is tested using chamber residence times of 75–300 ms, and the equipment's entire range of power inputs. The hemoglobin release kinetic parameters are determined and it is shown that above a particular level, increasing power input can actually result in a decreased rate constant. Ultrasonic processing can damage proteins, so reduction of hemoglobin's flocculant activity is considered.

The coupled mass transfer and mechanical deformation model provided accurate estimate of the volume of peas at saturation. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the mechanical deformation has negligible effect on the water absorption while the most important model components for appropriate estimation of the water content of peas during steeping were the rate constant for the Peleg equation and the surface mass transfer coefficient for the mechanistic models.",

The aim of this study was to design various factors by observing their effects on xylitol production from hemicellulosic hydrolysate by xylose reductase (XR) enzyme. The one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) strategy was adopted to determine the effective levels of process factors influencing xylitol yield. Enzymatic xylitol production was conducted in batch mode using different levels of reaction time (2–18 h), temperature (20–70 °C), pH (4.0–9.0), xylose concentration (9.4–37.6 g/L), NADPH concentration (1.17–5.32 g/L), enzyme concentration (2–6%), and agitation (50–150 rpm). Among the factors examined, time, temperature, pH, NADPH, and enzyme concentration significantly influenced the biosynthesis of xylitol with the suitable level of 10 h, 30 °C, 7.0, 3.66 g/L, and 3% (v/v), respectively.

     "abstract": "The behavior of peeled and unpeeled cherry tomatoes was investigated during forced convective drying. The study showed that the drying process highly alters the shape of the samples. This alteration (shrinkage) was examined using a non-destructive X-ray microtomography imaging technique. For both cases (peeled and unpeeled tomatoes), the volume of the sample decreased linearly with its moisture content. Furthermore, the effects of the operating air temperature as well as the peel on the drying curves were explored. Accordingly, increasing the air temperature deceased drying time from 1200 ks at 50 °C to 500 ks at 70 °C for the unpeeled sample and from 80 ks at 60 °C to 50 ks at 70 °C for the peeled sample. The effect of the peel was substantial as the drying time of the unpeeled sample was 5–10 times higher than that of the peeled sample. Based on the analytical solution of the diffusion model, a moisture diffusion coefficient was determined using two approaches. The first approach used a graphical representation and the moisture diffusion coefficient was directly deduced from the trend line of the curves. For the second approach, a correction factor was introduced into the analytical solution and the modeling results showed that the moisture diffusion coefficient was varying with the moisture content of the tested material. The comparison between the experimental data and the modeling results using the two approaches showed that the second approach, which included the effect of shrinkage, was more suitable for predicting the variations of the drying curves for the different operating conditions and for both peeled and unpeeled tomatoes. Using this second approach, the moisture diffusion coefficient for the unpeeled tomato was 2.0 × 10−11 m2/s at 50 °C and 3.5 × 10−11 m2/s at 70 °C. Similarly, the maximum values of the moisture diffusion coefficient for the peeled tomato varied from 3.0 × 10−10 m2/s at 50 °C to 5.0 × 10−10 m2/s at 70 °C. Moreover, performing modeling while neglecting shrinkage resulted in an over estimation of the moisture diffusion coefficient. In addition, operating conditions, dimensions of the samples and shrinkage had a direct effect on the external mass transfer coefficient.",

Response surface methodology (RSM) is used to study the effects of incubation temperature, incubation time and enzyme concentration and their mutual interaction effects on the physical characteristics of apple juice such as alcohol insoluble solid (AIS), viscosity, clarity, total polyphenol, flavonoid and protein during enzyme treatment of apple juice. A central composite design (CCD) is employed to develop the quadratic model and optimizing the operating conditions of the enzyme treatment process for obtaining the desired characteristics of juice. During ultrafiltration enzyme pre-treated apple juice, the flux decline behavior is modeled using Hermia's approach for constant pressure dead-end filtration laws. Two model parameters, namely intermediate pore blocking coefficient and cake filtration coefficient are obtained by minimizing the error involved between calculated and experimental flux data. These parameters along with known operating conditions, membrane permeability and physical properties of feed enable one to predict the transient permeate flux decline. The effect of various operating conditions, such as feed temperature, stirrer speed and transmembrane pressure on the flux decline is demonstrated. Experimental results show that operating conditions have significant effect on the onset of cake formation as well as on the flux decline behavior. The model predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol-free beer is a secondary product of brewing industry, nevertheless, its production is motivated by the global trend for healthier lifestyle and the awareness about the benefits of moderate beer drinking. A modified osmotic distillation was investigated in order to minimize the loss of volatile compounds, to reduce the water consumption and, hence, decrease the environmental impact of the process. In particular, the osmotic distillation technique here proposed consists of recycling the stripping solutions from a preliminary dealcoholization process of a batch of beer to that of further batches.A cost estimation showed that the proposed modification of the process was able to significantly reduce the cost of stripping water, which negatively influenced the operating costs in conventional osmotic distillation processes.Regarding to the beer quality, properties such as colour and polyphenols content were almost unchanged in the dealcoholized beer with respect to the original one while bitterness, foam stability, turbidity, O2 and CO2 content were statistically different.From the comparison of alcohol-free and original beer, a modification in the content of volatile compounds was observed. The volatile compounds losses were respectively of 77% for higher alcohols, 99% for esters and 93% for aldehydes. However, the loss of volatile compounds obtained in this study was very similar to literature results on beer dealcoholization by dialysis, falling film evaporation, vacuum distillation and reverse osmosis.Post treatments and blending techniques such as carbonation, addition of fresh yeasts following by maturation or by blending with krausen, original or aromatic beer may be used to improve the product quality.",

     "abstract": "The conventional methodology was refined for calculating the heat transfer coefficients (U and hfp) under rapid heating conditions. The conventional methodology of hfp evaluation became unreliable and/or non-reproducible under rapid heating conditions such as those encountered during reciprocation thermal processing. This was due to fluctuations in gathered transient temperatures during rapid reciprocating motion and due to very short equilibration times (EQT) (heat-up time to 1 °C below operating temperature).In this method, U and hfp were calculated employing temperature profiles predicted by using an average retort temperature (after the come-up period) and heat penetration parameters, instead of real data points from experimental temperature profile as used in conventional methodology. The method was validated for various reciprocation frequencies (0–3 Hz) and amplitudes (0–20 cm). Results revealed that the refined methodology was robust and produced reliable and consistent values of U and hfp, under both slow and rapid heating conditions. Also, the heat transfer coefficient values, using the developed method, consistently matched the results and trends observed with conventional methods. A parameter sensitivity analysis was also conducted and the effects of perturbations of different parameters employed in the refined methodology were reported.",

     "abstract": "In this present work, performance of non-porous membrane distillation method is investigated during beer dealcoholization process. A thin-film composite polyamide membrane is used as membrane module while a commercial beer product with 5%-volume ethanol is used as feed. The results indicate that non-porous membrane distillation can be used to dealcoholize beer without losing the other nutrients and flavoring components such as maltose and glycerol. The increase of feed pressure and vacuum pressure can improve membrane flux due to higher permeability. However, membrane selectivity is decreased with the increase of vacuum pressure. The membrane flux and ethanol concentration in permeate are 0.15–0.76 L/m2 h and 3.66–4.64%-vol., respectively. Meanwhile, there are no specific sequences on the maltose concentration in the effect of operating conditions. The slight loss of maltose in the dealcoholized beer can be attributed to adsorption phenomena in membrane surface thus membrane flushing may be conducted to recover it. The glycerol behavior in dealcoholization process is similar to maltose. Some glycerol compounds are found in the permeate stream but all of them are less than 0.005%-vol. At 3000 mbar feed pressure and 580 mbar vacuum pressure, the flux of membrane is 0.69 L/m2 h with 3.70%-vol. and 4.60%-vol. of ethanol concentration in dealcoholized beer and permeates side respectively, no maltose and only 0.001%-vol. glycerol in permeate side.

For the thermodynamic properties, the differential and integral enthalpy of BP showed a synergic effect of the combined components. This shows that using a combination of polymers increases the interaction energy of water molecules with the surface of the material. The monolayers from the BET and GAB models showed similar moisture content values that corresponded to the minimum integral entropy. Finally, the behavior of the enthalpy–entropy compensation of water adsorption for the SP, MP and GA powders at low moisture contents demonstrated that the content is controlled by an entropic mechanism, for BP, BPP and LP powders, the water adsorption may be considered as mainly enthalpy-driven.",

Material type (CDS vs. MCDS), dwell time, drum internal steam temperature, and gap width were evaluated for their effects on the final moisture content, water activity, and color of the dried product. While both CDS and MCDS could be dried to a range of endpoint moisture contents, dried CDS exhibited a narrow range of water activity compared to that of MCDS. Gap width was found to be the predominant factor affecting dried product color. This work demonstrates that drum drying can effectively reduce the moisture content of CDS, even though the water activity of the dried product cannot be reduced beyond ∼0.45.

In this study, okara was treated in six selected alkali conditions, and then SSPS were extracted under the acidic condition (115 °C, 100 min, pH 4.5). The obtained SSPS were determined to have degree of esterification (DE) of 49, 55, 60, 66, 74 and 83%, respectively. Violent alkali treatment produced SSPS with not only lower DE but also lower molecular weight (MW) compared to mild alkali treatment. MW was increased from 396 to 489 kDa with increasing DE. It was found that SSPS with lower DE possessed lower aqueous viscosity, more negative charges, better emulsifying activity in oil-in-water emulsion and stabilizing activity in acidic milk drink.

Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry results showed an enrichment of the lactotripeptide isoleucine–proline–proline with a yield of up to 80% in the third cycle and a twofold increase in purity to up to 35%. Some guidelines are given for the competitive exhaustion of the adsorbent for process optimization in order to obtain higher purity and yield.",

     "abstract": "A hot air drying system equipped with real-time computer vision system was used to investigate the effects of drying variables on apple slices color changes. Drying experiments were conducted at drying air temperatures of 50–70 °C, drying air velocities of 1–2 m/s, and samples thicknesses of 2–6 mm. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) was also used to correlate color parameters and moisture content of apple slices with drying variables and drying time. The effects of drying air temperature and sample thickness on color changes were dominated over the effect of drying air velocity. However, non-linear and somewhat complex trends were obtained for all color parameters as function of moisture content. The MLP ANN satisfactorily approximated the color and moisture variations of apple slices with correlation coefficient higher than 0.92. Therefore, the computer vision system supplemented with ANN can be used as a non-invasive, low cost, and easy method for fast and in-line assessing and controlling of foodstuffs color and moisture changes during drying.",

     "abstract": "In this study, energy consumption of intermittent drying of paddy rice is considered. Firstly, a mathematical model consists of two parts is established to describe the moisture distribution within a grain for both drying and tempering stages. The model, which is solved analytically, is proposed based on Fick's second law of diffusion within a sphere. Effects of different parameters namely air temperature and velocity are experimentally investigated utilizing a lab-scale fluidized bed dryer. Thereafter, moisture diffusivity is estimated in Arrhenius form using experimental results. Finally, the model is utilized in an optimization problem to minimize the total energy consumption. Based on experimental results, impact of air velocity on drying characteristics is found to be negligible. The optimization results shows that employing the tempering stages substantially reduces the energy consumption. Not only that, it dictates a process beginning with longer drying stages and lower temperatures while the subsequent stages are shorter with higher temperatures.",

     "abstract": "The past decade has seen an increasing focus on the issues surrounding climate change and this has triggered international governments to develop environmental legislation and policies for the energy-intensive industries (EIIs) that can help reduce their anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. The biopharmaceutical industry is a relatively new EII. The industry is important for global health as it is a main provider of affordable new therapies, achieved through the genetic manipulation of living organisms. Historically, attractive financial returns have encouraged the biopharmaceutical industry to focus on employing decision-support tools to estimate the process economics of manufacture. However, as the industry matures, the level of environmental scrutiny is increasing. Therefore, there is a need for the development of environmental tools specific to this industry to help guide the selection of environmentally favourable manufacturing operations. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a commonly used environmental tool. We study the potential for application in the biopharmaceutical industry as an aid to decision making. Such tools assess the environmental impacts of a product or process over the entire life cycle. This paper reviews the use of LCA in the context of decision-making when applied to evaluate the environmental impact of the biopharmaceutical industry's manufacturing processes.",

Experimental conditions were selected to operate the photobioreactor that could provide a balance between protein content and cell growth. Then, S. platensis was cultured in an airlift tubular photobioreactor using mineral medium supplemented with beet vinasse (SVM media).

The present work demonstrates that the alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) method for fractionating lignocelluloses, such as corncob, is advantageous due to its modest reaction conditions, low alkaline usage, and effective fractionation of three components. The removal ratio of lignin and hemicellulose after 6 h treatment reached 75.4% and 38.7%, respectively, leaving the recovery ratio of cellulose in the AHP residues at 81.3%. After 24 h enzymatic hydrolysis of the AHP residues, we found that the degree of cellulose conversion was approximately 80%. Through ethanol precipitation and desalination, 89% of dissolved hemicellulose was recovered as white solids, whereas 77.5% of soluble lignin was obtained as brown solids. The isolated three components were further characterized. The major pyrolysis temperature of the AHP residues increased. And the recovered lignin revealed an increase in carboxylic acid content and a decrease in phenolic hydroxyl content by oxidation of H2O2.",

In this study, membrane fouling caused by a well-known protein (BSA), a humic acid and a well-known polysaccharide (dextran) as representatives of three main constituents of EPS; proteins, humic substances and polysaccharides were investigated. The objective of this study was to develop a fundamental understanding of fouling mechanisms using a combined pore blockage and cake filtration model with respect to hydrophilic nature of membranes and the pre-filtration effect of the foulant deposit layer. These two factors were inserted in a combined pore blockage and cake filtration model and this modification resulted in much better agreement between the modified model predictions and the experimental data. The experimental data were obtained over a range of foulant concentrations and transmembrane pressures. The results showed that the rate of flux decline is proportional to the hydrophilic nature of membrane, i.e. the extent of fouling in hydrophilic membranes with smaller water contact angle is smaller than that in hydrophobic membranes with larger water contact angle. Also, the fouling rate of the foulants with higher pre-filtration effect is smaller, so the foulants with higher resistance of the first deposit layer have smaller fouling rate. In this study, a modified pore blockage-cake filtration model was also developed. The predicted results were in very good agreement with the experimental data.",

A 30% emulsion of maltodextrin and Arabic gum in the ratio 7:1 by mass in water and aroma was prepared. The addition of lemon aroma was 2, 6 and 10% (w/w). It was found that in emulsions an increase of aroma addition caused an increase in diameter from 2.4 to 4 μm for Ultra Turrax high shear homogenization and did not change the diameter size for pressure homogenization. For pressure homogenization similar viscosity values were observed. A different effect was observed for high shear homogenization (31–40 mPa s). Increase in aroma addition caused an increase in viscosity. Moreover, a similar diameter of the aroma phase after reconstitution of emulsion from powder (0.7–1.3 μm) was observed. In powders with an increasing amount of aroma, regardless of homogenization method, an increase in porosity, spread of particle size and total colour differences and also a decrease in loose bulk density, solubility and lightness were observed.

     "abstract": "Following previous studies, the aim of this work is to further investigate the application of colloidal gas aphrons (CGA) to the recovery of polyphenols from a grape marc ethanolic extract with particular focus on exploring the use of a non-ionic food grade surfactant (Tween 20) as an alternative to the more toxic cationic surfactant CTAB. Different batch separation trials in a flotation column were carried out to evaluate the influence of surfactant type and concentration and processing parameters (such as pH, drainage time, CGA/extract volumetric and molar ratio) on the recovery of total and specific phenolic compounds. The possibility of achieving selective separation and concentration of different classes of phenolic compounds and non-phenolic compounds was also assessed, together with the influence of the process on the antioxidant capacity of the recovered compounds. The process led to good recovery, limited loss of antioxidant capacity, but low selectivity under the tested conditions. Results showed the possibility of using Tween 20 with a separation mechanism mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions. Volumetric ratio rather than the molar ratio was the key operating parameter in the recovery of polyphenols by CGA.",

Trials were done in six application groups with single electrical treatment and combinations. Orange juices were stored for six months at +4 °C and the analyses were performed in a two-month period. As a result of the electroplasmolysis application, more than an 8% increase in yield was determined. In addition, more than 95% PME inactivation was found in moderate (69–75 °C) temperature conditions for MW and OH applications. The results showed that the highest quality values, such as total pectin and ascorbic acid were determined on combined applications of electrical methods. The results suggested that juice yield and functional properties were increased by electroplasmolysis applications; electroplasmolysis and electrical heating applications gave better quality results comparing the conventional thermal heating (CH) in orange juice production. Quality characteristics of the juices can be preserved better and longer in the juices that are processed with electrical methods than the conventional methods.",

Three caseinolytic proteases clear bands were observed in the zymogram test suggesting the presence of at least three different major proteinases.This proteolytic crude extract was then tested for its potential applications, especially in laundry detergents and shrimp waste treatment. Results showed that it was extremely stable toward non-ionic surfactants (Tween 20, Tween 80 and Triton X-100). It was also stable in the presence of oxidizing agents, retaining 100% of its initial activity in the presence of 1% sodium perborate. Interestingly, it showed relative stability and compatibility with commercial liquid and solid detergents. These properties and the high activity in high alkaline pH make these proteases an ideal choice for application in detergent formulations.Additionally, S. scrofa proteases were found to be effective in the deproteinization of shrimp waste. A high level of deproteinization 83 ± 1.3% was recorded with an E/S ratio of 10 U/mg after 3 h incubation at 50 °C.

     "abstract": "Corn starch's ability to bind and carry a yerba mate extract with strong antioxidant properties was explored in this paper. The starch was treated by high hydrostatic pressure to increase its loading capacity and scanning electron microscopy revealed that the high pressure treatment altered the shape of starch granules and changed their surface appearance. High pressure caused partial granule gelatinization as determined by calorimetric measurements, also increasing the granule specific surface area, as quantified by nitrogen adsorption. This increase in surface was due to the generation of pores, which favored the adsorption of the yerba mate hydrosoluble polyphenols. The yerba mate polyphenol concentration in the starch carriers was determined by HPLC-MS and its antioxidant activity was measured by the DPPH radical and photochemiluminiscense (PCL) methods. Treated starches incorporated a higher amount of yerba mate polyphenols, however, native starch could be an appropriate antioxidant carrier as well. Furthermore, it was found that the antioxidant activity was maintained after high pressure treatment without changing the yerba mate polyphenols profile.",

The manufacture of restructured products from mechanically recovered fish meat (MRFM) obtained from tilapia fileting allows the use of proteins of high biological value that would otherwise be discharged into the environment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of washing cycles (either one cycle or five cycles) and of the addition of tapioca starch (20% vs. a no-starch control) on the characteristics of surimi obtained from MRFM produced by the tilapia industry and destined for use in restructured products. To evaluate the quality attributes of the product, the structure of a surimi protein matrix and its relationship to selected physicochemical parameters and morphological characteristics was assessed. Both the number of washing cycles and the starch addition were found to influence the moisture, protein and lipid content of the MRFM surimi. Higher whiteness was found after five washing cycles. Because the tapioca starch acted as a stabilizer, the fat globules were more stable and well distributed, and an emulsion with better properties resulted. A homogeneous network of fat globules linked to the protein matrix by a layer of tapioca starch was formed. Another advantage of this approach is that tapioca starch is gluten free. This property is important for specific groups in the population, e.g., celiac-intolerant consumers.",

The model exhibited enough versatility to estimate the polarization resistance and flux decline profile for wide set of operating conditions. The polarization resistance and pore blocking resistance were found to be a strong increasing function of transmembrane pressure and a decreasing function of Reynolds number. The limiting and threshold operating conditions were also identified. From theoretical calculation, a phase space plot of transmembrane pressure and Reynolds number was generated to identify the optimal operating conditions that would result the maximum productivity.

The MIRD–FD combination was found to be inferior compared to the FD–MIRD as the former tended to produce products with a collapsed surface layer and poor rehydration capability.

The result of textural properties showed that hardness, elasticity and cohesiveness of CSG were lower than those of BG. Further, the gel strength of CSG (192.01 g) was lower than that of BG (259.65 g), possibly due to lower imino-acid content.

     "abstract": "The effect of high hydrostatic pressure (350–550 MPa, 3–12 min) and initial inoculum levels (102–106 CFU/mL (CFU/g)) on Staphylococcus aureus at room temperature in saline solution and meat slurry were investigated, and the Weibull model was used to describe the inactivation of S. aureus in both media. The results showed that the reduction of S. aureus was enhanced with increasing the pressure level and the pressure holding time in both media. The inactivation rate of S. aureus increased with increasing the initial inoculum level in saline solution, whereas 104 CFU/g of initial inoculum caused the higher log-reduction of S. aureus than the other two initial inoculum levels in meat slurry. Regression coefficients (R2), root mean square (RMSE) values and residual plot suggested that the Weibull model produced a good fit to the data. However, the shape factor (n) was not significantly dependent on the pressure and initial inoculum level. Multiple linear regression was further used to describe the effect of pressure and log initial inoculum level on the scale factor (b) values. Based on the primary and secondary models, the inactivation of S. aureus in the both two media was predicted satisfactory by the tertiary model. In addition, 3 log-reduction of S. aureus was obtained by the combination treatment of HHP (350 MPa for 6 min) and nisin (500 ppm), which has met Food Safety Standard on Quick Frozen Flour and Rice Products for microorganism in the People's Republic of China.",

     "abstract": "Sisal (Agave sisalana) is the main hard fiber produced worldwide, with an estimated generation of 400 thousands t in 2011. From its leaves, only the hard fibers, which represent 3–5% of their weight, are removed. The remaining 95–97% is referred to as sisal waste and contains steroidal saponins that can be potentially used in foods, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals formulations, as well as for soil bioremediation. The present work aimed at to evaluate strategies for the extraction and concentration of saponins from sisal waste, focused on the use of clean solvents, such as water and ethanol. For this purpose, it was firstly performed a central composite rotatable design for the optimization of the extraction conditions followed by a comparison of this strategy with other methods (Soxhlet, ultrasound-assisted extraction and micellar extraction). Cloud point preconcentration was then tested, using several types and concentrations of salts. The use of orbital shaker extraction (200 rpm) with an ethanolic solution (30%, v/v) at 50 °C, a mass/volume ratio sisal/solvent of 0.17 (g/mL) for 4 h allowed a recovery of 38.6% of the saponins. When a micellar extraction strategy using 7.5% (v/v) of Triton X-100, under the above-mentioned conditions was performed, saponins recovery raised to 98.4%. In a subsequent step, the addition of 20% (m/v) sodium carbonate led to a preconcentration factor of 20.3. The best adsorbent for Triton removal from the preconcentrated solution was Amberlite FPX-66. The process strategy proposed in the present study showed to be efficient for saponins extraction and preconcentration from a low-cost, highly available agricultural waste.",

For this, previous results of the nanofiltration of commercial red must using the SR3 membrane in a flat sheet crossflow module were compared with those obtained for the filtration of natural red must using the same membrane in a spiral wound module at two different applied pressures.The aim of this publication is to analyze the main differences between red grape must nanofiltration at laboratory and at pilot plant scale.showed that the flow destabilization and eddy promotion caused by spacers in the spiral wound module mitigate the rate at which the cake thickens and compacts on the membrane surface. This causes a less sharp flux decrease, less variable sugars rejection and osmotic pressure difference. Moreover, higher applied pressure promotes a higher membrane fouling and osmotic pressure that worsen the flux decay.",

Temperature, pressure and ice saturation histories were computed. Drying rates and spatial temperature profiles showed excellent agreement with literature experimental data. Sublimation front width, a novel result, is seen to increase as ice saturation decreases, justifying the importance of this distributed sublimation formulation in contrast with the sharp sublimation front commonly employed in literature. The insulation effect of the gas fraction in the pores is observed by the slow movement of the sublimation front in ‘thick’ samples.

The increase of extraction yield depended on the solvent.

However, the modified microstructure did not cause a difference between drying curves at each germination time. Prediction results of the moisture content from the two-layer model were in good agreement with the experimental results and also showed that the effective moisture diffusion coefficient values of husk were significantly lower than those of germinated brown rice. Drying at a higher drying temperature could reduce the number of fissured GP more significantly. The hardness of cooked GP samples and their GABA contents obtained from drying temperatures changed insignificantly from that of the shade-dried GP. The sensory analysis results revealed that the texture of GP was better than that of the rice without germination and the longer germination time provided the adverse effect on the fermentation odour and texture.",

The potent tannin degrader was identified as Penicillium verrucosum using internal transcribed spacer's (ITS) −5.8S rDNA analysis.

Dynamic evolution of the fouling layer surface (even with a complex shape) and its intricate interactions with hydrodynamics and fouling kinetics can then be rigorously taken into account.

     "abstract": "Falling-film evaporators are widely used for the concentration of liquid foods, especially milk prior to spray drying. Given that an evaporator is a heat exchanger, it is often incorrectly assumed that fouling is similar in heat exchangers and evaporators. This paper describes a number of features of falling-film evaporators that have been studied in recent years, and hence it seeks to show that attention to design detail should lead to lower rates of fouling.Typically fouling is due to poor liquid distribution to the tubes, which leads to drying of the milk films, or causes increases in viscosity to the point where flow stops. The minimum flow rates required to ensure wetting of tubes and flow into the tubes have been established but distributor holes must be correctly sized and drilled to give equal flow to all evaporator tubes. Blockage of distributor holes during operation can be avoided by installation of filters. Vapour flows from flashing or from unequal evaporation in the multiple passes of the same effect can interfere with the liquid flow from distributor plates but this can be overcome by the installation of vapour tubes in distributor plates.When correctly designed and fabricated, it is likely that falling film evaporators can operate in excess of 20 h without excessive fouling or bacterial growth.",

The flow pattern therein was characterized using two computational fluid dynamic calculation approaches. Full trials were run for 48 h at 10 °C with a Pseudomonas fluorescens strain to identify the preferential biofilm formation areas. As in current industrial systems, the pilot rig had recirculation areas and low wall shear stress rates (τw < 0.1 Pa) in corners and angles.

Additional tests were performed to understand the adhesion of B. cereus and P. fluorescens to the selected surfaces.Predictions of the adhesion potential according to the thermodynamic theory showed more favourable adhesion on SS than on PMMA, for both species. Thermodynamically, adhesion was more favourable for B. cereus. After BDMDAC treatment, thermodynamic adhesion ability was favoured for P. flurescens and decreased for B. cereus, mainly on PMMA. Both bacteria had negative surface charge and the exposure to BDMDAC increased the charge to less negative values. In vitro adhesion results were, for most cases, contradictory to those predicted by the thermodynamic theory. Single and dual species biofilms were formed in the RCR for 7 days. Afterwards, the biofilms were exposed to the chemical (use of BDMDAC) and to hydrodynamic stresses (use of increasing Reynolds number of agitation), alone and combined. The applications of BDMDAC or hydrodynamic stress, when applied alone, were insufficient to remove the biofilms from the surfaces. The combined effects of BDMDAC with a series of increasing Reynolds number of agitation promoted additional biofilm removal. This effect was dependent on the surface used. For PMMA, the hydrodynamic stress was more effective on the removal of BDMDAC-treated dual species biofilms. For SS, the synergy of the chemical and hydrodynamic stresses removed more B. cereus and dual species biofilms. The overall results demonstrate that the species association was not advantageous in biofilm resistance to removal when compared with the single species biofilms, particularly those of P. fluorescens. In general, removal by hydrodynamic stress, alone and preceded by the BDMDAC treatment, was higher for biofilms formed on SS. However, even the combined action of BDMDAC and the exposure to a series of increasing Reynolds number of agitation were not effective to obtain biofilm-free surfaces.",

A rotating cylinder reactor was used to form biofilms, allowing the simulation of τ w conditions similar to those found in industrial settings, particularly in areas with low τ w like elbows, corners, valves and dead zones. Bacillus cereus was used as a model bacterium for biofilm formation. Biofilms were formed on AISI316 stainless steel cylinders under different τ w (estimated at 0.02, 0.12 and 0.17 Pa) for 7 days. Some phenotypic characteristics, including thickness, biomass production, cellular density and extracellular proteins and polysaccharides content were assessed. Biofilm density was found to increase significantly with τ w while the thickness decreased. Also, biofilms formed at 0.02 Pa had lowest biomass content, cell density and extracellular polysaccharide content. Those characteristics were not statistically different for the biofilms formed under 0.12 and 0.17 Pa.Ex situ tests were performed by treating the biofilms with the biocide benzyldimethyldodecyl ammonium chloride (BDMDAC), followed by exposure to increasing τ w conditions, up to 1.84 Pa (whereas the maximum τ w used during growth was 0.17 Pa). The biofilms formed under low τ w were more resistant to removal caused by the BDMDAC action alone. Those formed under higher τ w were more resistant to the mechanical and the combined chemical and mechanical treatments. The amount of biofilm remaining on the cylinders, after both treatments was statistically similar for biofilms formed under 0.12 and 0.17 Pa. The resistance of biofilms to removal by mechanical treatment (alone and combined with BDMDAC) was related to the amount of matrix polysaccharides. However, none of the methods investigated were able to remove all the biofilm from the cylinders.",

To date, experimental data has been limited to whey proteins, raising questions of the applicability of the theoretical frameworks developed for whey proteins to other protein systems. In this work the dissolution of crude egg white gels is studied, which are rich in ovalbumin protein, and which have recently shown a different cleaning behavior to whey deposits. Egg white gels made in well-defined conditions were dissolved in a wide range of alkali and sodium chloride concentrations, and temperature. The dissolution rate was found to increase linearly with the alkali concentration up to 1 M, hence confirming the absence of an optimum cleaning concentration observed in whey protein cleaning studies. The apparent activation energy of dissolution for particulate egg white gels was 70–80 kJ mol−1, suggesting that the dissolution of egg white gels is controlled by the β-elimination of disulfide bonds. Dissolution experiments with salts at different temperatures confirmed that swelling is very important in the dissolution of whey protein gels, but not in egg white gels.",

     "abstract": "A mathematical mechanistic swelling-removal approach has been developed for modelling the cleaning process in dried protein samples using the scanning fluid dynamic gauge (sFDG). The algorithm combines swelling phenomena with removal mechanisms (shear stress removal and soil dissolution). Swelling phenomena were described by applying analytical expressions based on poroelasticity theory. The nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) describing the thickness swelling ratio was solved numerically, allowing the soil to be divided into theoretical layers. The novelty is presented as the cleaning process is integrated by the elimination of those layers. The model predicts the variation of the soil thickness over time. To describe kinetics of removal, experimental results were considered. Constant removal rates were found after an initial transition period. Removal rates were dependent on the different chemical and physical factors acting: temperature, chemistry concentration (pH, enzyme level), shear stress and frequency of application of shear stress. Soil remaining, total mass or percentage of cleaning over time can also be calculated as outputs. Overall the model has the potential to apply varying cleaning conditions over time and grow to a more theoretical approach in the future by applying enzyme kinetics.",

Marked increases in permeate flux were recorded for ethanol treated UF membranes over a range of molecular weight cut-off values. Ethanol treatment also aided fluxes over multiple foul-clean cycles, and enabled the enhanced transmission of polyphenols during UF for the clarification of black tea liquor. Following tea fouling and NaOH cleaning repetitions, PWF values of treated membranes were returned to values of >150% of the untreated virgin membrane PWF over 4/5 consecutive cycles, indicating that the ethanol pre-treatment strategy adopted had a prolonged effect upon subsequent performance.",

In order to regain the flux of the membranes, cleaning procedures are conducted, whereby inorganic scale is often removed with acids and organic matter with surfactants under alkaline conditions. Currently, either ionic surfactants or alkylphenol ethoxylates are utilised to clean membranes of organic matter. Other nonionic surfactants (i.e. fatty alcohol ethoxylates) are not applied, due to the assumption that they irreversibly adhere to the membrane surface and thereby clog the pores. At BASF we have studied the adsorption of a wide range of nonionic surfactants to membrane materials. It was shown, that the affinity of nonionic surfactants critically depends on their structure. Linear alkyl ethoxylates irreversibly adsorb to the membrane surfaces, whereas branched alkyl ethoxylates do not. In a second step, we tested the cleaning performance of nonionic surfactants. Similar to the results for adsorption, a structure-performance relationship was discovered where several branched alkyl ethoxylates showed excellent cleaning results. In a third step, combinations of nonionic surfactants, chelating agents and enzymes were tested in terms of cleaning efficiency. All tested combinations showed excellent cleaning performance on bacterial fouling layers.",

     "publication date": "01-2015",
     "abstract": "We investigate the fluid mechanics of cleaning viscous drops attached to a flat inclined surface using thin gravity-driven film flows. We focus on the case where the drop cannot be detached either partially or completely from the surface by the mechanical forces exerted by the cleaning fluid on the drop surface. Instead a convective mass transfer establishes across the drop–film interface and the fluid in the drop dissolves into the cleaning film flow, which then transports it away. The characteristic time scale of dissolution is much longer than the advection time scale in the film flow. Thus, the shape and size of the drop can be considered as quasi-steady. To assess the impact of the shape and size of the drop on the velocity of the cleaning fluid, we have developed a novel experimental technique based on particle image velocimetry. We show the velocity distribution at the film surface in the situations both where the film is flowing over a smooth surface, and where it is perturbed by a solid obstacle representing a very viscous drop. We find that at intermediate Reynolds numbers the acceleration of the starting film is overestimated by a plane model using the lubrication approximation. In the perturbed case, the streamwise velocity is strongly affected by the presence of the obstacle. The upstream propagation of the disturbance is limited, but the disturbance extends downstream for distances larger than 10 obstacle diameters. Laterally, we observe small disturbances in both the streamwise and lateral velocities, owing to stationary capillary waves. The flow also exhibits a complex three-dimensional converging pattern immediately below the obstacle.",

In Cleaning in Place (CIP) systems different flow types provide the cleaning effect by interaction, wherein falling liquid films make a significant contribution to cleaning. The flow of falling films can be significantly influenced by the design of the surface and, for example, of the tilt angle. In a previous publication it was shown for a low tilt angle of 30° that for resource efficient cleaning a low wetting rate is suitable. It was pointed out that mean wall shear stress and mean flow velocity have an influence on the cleaning progress. In this paper the investigations are extended to describe the influence of the surface inclination in the range of 30–90° on the flow and cleaning behavior of zinc sulfide/Xanthan gum soil layers on stainless steel for film Reynolds numbers of 1190-3110. The results show that the tilt angle has a major impact on the film thickness, wall shear stress and the mean cleaning rate. Cleaning results for three different stainless steel surfaces show that a low surface roughness does not necessarily lead to a better cleaning result.",

     "abstract": "Liquid jets are widely used in cleaning operations in the food sector. Morison and Thorpe (2002) reported an experimental investigation of the flow patterns and cleaning behaviour of horizontal jets impinging on vertical walls. The Wilson et al. (2012) model, which described Morison and Thorpe's flow pattern data well, is extended to describe the flow pattern generated by a liquid jet, approaching a surface at a given angle to the horizontal, impinging on a plate inclined at a known angle to the vertical. The results are compared with experimental data collected for horizontal water jets impinging on inclined Perspex and glass plates. Tests employed nozzle diameters of 1, 2 and 3 mm at room temperature, using flow rates of 0.78–2.23 g s−1, 3.7–9.9 g s−1 and 7.1–17.3 g s−1 (0.025–0.062 m3 h−1) respectively. These are lower than industrial cleaning flow rates. The angle at which the horizontal jet impinged on the plate was varied from 30° to 120°. Two important dimensions are evaluated: (i) the width of the fast moving radial flow zone on the plate (the region bounded by the film jump, the feature similar to a hydraulic jump) at the plane of impingement; (ii) the distance on the plate to which the radial flow zone extends above the point of impingement. Both are described reasonably well by the model. Empirical relationships are reported for the width of the wetted region at the level of impingement, and the maximum width of the draining film. A short study of cleaning of layers of washable paint on glass, similar to the tests reported by Morison and Thorpe, show that the cleaning model recently developed by Wilson et al.

     "abstract": "Surface modification has been proposed as an attractive mitigation strategy for combating heat exchanger fouling in the food industry and other sectors. Antifouling coatings manipulate the interactions between the surface and fouling precursors or fouling deposit to either extend the induction period before appreciable fouling starts and/or reduce the rate of deposition. A successful surface treatment should extend the time between cleaning operations, thereby reducing the operating cost of the system. A modified exchanger will, however, incur additional capital costs for replacement and this needs to be compared to the anticipated savings during operation. This paper considers the economic attractiveness of replacing existing exchangers by units with modified surfaces in a retrofit. Three cases are considered, which are modelled using fouling rates taken from studies in the literature. Antifouling performance is expressed in terms of (i) extended induction period before fouling starts, and/or (ii) reduced fouling rate. The annualised total cost (operating + annualised capital spend) is mapped for different combinations of these parameters to establish the economically favourable region for a coating at different coating prices. This allows the value pricing margin to be identified, where the expected benefits have to be split between the cost of the coating and the benefit to the manufacturer and operator. The case studies are (a) DLC-related surface modification to reduce aqueous crystallisation fouling; (b) fluorocarbon-based coatings which offer antifouling performance but can reduce heat transfer, for crystallisation fouling; and (c) fluorocarbon-based coatings in a dairy pasteuriser application. A novel strategy, of replacing stainless steel with fluorocarbon coated carbon steel, is also considered for case (b).",

Besides, one sample of freeze-dried extract was obtained to comparison.

Moisture content and anthocyanin retention were influenced by the drying temperature and carrier agent concentration, whereas hygroscopicity was more influenced by the carrier concentration. The moisture sorption isotherms were also influenced by the maltodextrin concentration. Infrared spectroscopy indicated that the extract was covered or encapsulated by the carrier agent. During storage, samples containing maltodextrin preserved the color more intensely than the freeze-dried sample and the liquid extract. Results suggested that spray drying of Bordo grape extracts using maltodextrin produces powders with low moisture content, low hygroscopicity, high solubility, and stable color.

The separation process is optimized by investigating the effect of pH on adsorption capacity and effect of concentration of ethanol on desorption capacity. The dynamic adsorption is carried out in a column packed with Indion 810 resin and effect of feed flow rate and initial concentration of GA in extract has been studied. The results showed that increase in feed flow rate as well as initial feed concentration of GA lowers the dynamic binding capacity and mass transfer coefficient while increases the HETP. The purity of GA is increased from 14.3% to 71.5% by the dynamic desorption with 60% ethanol. Indion 810 resin can efficiently separate GA from licorice root extract with the HPLC recovery of 63.6%. This study forms the basis for large scale preparation of GA by resin adsorption.",

     "abstract": "To understand the solid-phase crystallization growth kinetics of glucose powders, a laboratory-scale spray dryer (Buchi B290) was used with aqueous solutions of glucose to create amorphous powders. The amorphous powders were placed in a sorption box at a relative humidity of 75% and six different temperatures (15 °C, 20 °C, 25 °C, 30 °C, 35 °C and 40 °C) for water-induced crystallization. The experimental results showed that the enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of activation of glucose increased during the crystallization process, which suggested that the binding energy needed for the formation of an activated complex increases as the moisture content decreases. The energy of activation for glucose crystallization has been found by the activated rate equation to be 58 ± 8 kJ mol−1, and the entropy of activation was found to be −92 ± 27 J mol−1 K−1. A linear plot of compensation between the enthalpy and entropy of activation suggests that solid-phase crystallization for glucose is an entropy-controlled process.",

The underlying criteria for this classification are subjective without quantified criteria and standards defined by cork industry or consumers. Image analysis was applied to premium, good and standard quality classes to characterize the surface of the cork stoppers and stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA) was used to build predictive classification models. The final goal is to analyze the contribution of each porosity feature and propose an algorithm for cork stoppers quality class classification. This study provides the knowledge based on a large sampling to an accurate grading of natural cork stoppers.In average all the models presented accuracy in relation to the commercial classification over 68% with a higher mismatch in the mid-quality range. Color showed an important discriminating power, increasing the accuracy in 10%. The main discriminant features were porosity coefficient and color variables, calculated for the lateral surface. A quality classification algorithm was presented based on a simplified model with an accuracy of 75%. The classification based on color vision systems can ensure improved quality class uniformity and a higher transparency in trade.",

     "abstract": "Potato pulp is a co-processing product from potato starch production. The pulp mainly consists of the tuber cell walls, which are rich in pectin and cellulose. The potato pulp pectin is dominated by galactan branched rhamnogalacturonan 1 which after enzymatic solubilization has shown promising properties as bifidogenic prebiotic fibers. The potato starch processing campaign is based on processing of fresh potatoes (in Denmark the campaign lasts from September to December). This study examines the effect of time of harvest and processing during the campaign on the yield of enzymatically solubilized potato polysaccharides applying a recently developed enzymatic process using 1.0% (w/w) [enzyme/substrate (E/S)] pectin lyase from Aspergillus nidulans and 1.0% (w/w) [E/S] polygalacturonase from A. aculeatus at 60 °C, 100 mM citric acid, pH 6.0 for 1 min. Seven samples drawn within the potato starch campaign of 2011 were characterized: the yields of enzymatically solubilized potato polysaccharides and the solubilized galactan proportion increased during the potato starch campaign. The data thus suggest that potato pulp produced late in the campaign would be preferable for upgrading to the bifidogenic fibers; this outcome may be the result of an inherent effect of the higher maturity of the potatoes late in the campaign.",

Grape skin and seed tannins exerted uncompetitive inhibition to the same extent, with a Ki value close to 1 g l gallic acid eq − 1 . The effect of free sulphur dioxide on immobilized bromelain changed respect to free enzyme, both becoming uncompetitive inhibitor and dramatically lowering its strength.These results show that immobilized stem bromelain could have productive biotechnological applications in winemaking, even though further studies will be necessary to test its proteolytic activity towards wine proteins in real matrices.",

     "abstract": "As the biopharmaceutical industry matures, the trend towards increased flexibility and productivity, faster time to market and greater profitability are driving the replacement of traditional stainless steel equipment by single-use technology (SUT). The use of SUT in the biopharmaceutical industry can significantly impact the manufacturing process efficiency by reducing capital costs, improving plant flexibility, reducing start-up times and costs, and eliminating both non-value added process steps and the risk of cross-contamination. In addition it significantly reduces process liquid waste, labour costs and on-site quality and validation requirements. This paper reviews the current status of the technology and the impact of SUT in the biopharmaceutical industry, with the aim of identifying the challenges and limitations that still need to be addressed for further adoption of these technologies. Even tough SUT has a multitude of systems available, its components and assemblies have little standardisation as well as a lack of harmonised tests and procedures among suppliers, with an array of guidelines from a variety of sources and no critical limits have been established. In addition, the use of SUT has new validation requirements such as leachables and extractables, suppliers’ qualification and SUT lot-to-lot variability. The lack of expertise in these areas and the new training requirements when using SUT also need to be addressed. To date the majority of the available literature regarding SUT is found in trade journals where typically suppliers are the main contributors. There is still a lack of engagement of the academic community, which contributes to very limited scientific proof from independent peer-reviewed research to support performance of SUT. This is particularly the case during operation and integrity testing of SUT, during for example on-site testing, transport and disposal. Another area where no work has been undertaken concerns conceptual approaches for facility clean-room requirement and appropriate layout design using SUT. Investment in novel technologies, research, standardisation and training is paramount for further development and implementation of SUTs across all sectors of the biopharmaceutical industry.",

However, its application range depends on the cost-effective production and purification of this molecule. Our group has previously produced nisin by Lactococcus lactis cultivation in milk whey, which is an industrial residue from dairy production. To our knowledge, no report used milk whey as a culture medium, although several investigators have purified nisin using different techniques. We thus aimed to establish a low-cost purification of nisin obtained by this process. Samples were diluted in ammonium sulphate, applied onto HIC columns (butyl sepharose CL 4B matrix), and eluted with Milli-Q water or PBS. Elution fractions were monitored for protein content and nisin antibacterial activity. Water elution resulted in purification factor values (270, commercial nisin; 775, nisin produced in-house) higher than those obtained with PBS elution. We concluded that purification of nisin does not require precipitation with ammonium sulphate, therefore allowing step/cost reduction. Moreover, purification from milk whey using HIC provides nisin with high activity and low salt content, which can further be applied to a variety of areas.",

     "abstract": "The presence of foam is an important characteristic of chocolate beverages. In Mexico, which is part of ancient Mesoamerica, the foam in chocolate has been produced since ancient times mainly through two different techniques: by pouring the liquid from one vessel to another and by using the molinillo, which is a chocolate beater widely used nowadays. Knowledge regarding the different designs and modes of use of the molinillo has traditionally been empirical. In this work, the performance of the molinillo during the preparation of a chocolate beverage was characterised through high-speed video, and the foam production at three different levels of immersion (clearance), was measured. Furthermore, the hydrodynamics of the system was analysed. The tip speed reached approximately 3 m s−1, and a typical forward-backward cycle lasted approximately 300 ms. A small clearance resulted in a high solid dispersion capacity but a limited foam production, whereas a large clearance improved the foam production but exhibited a poor solid suspension. The results quantitatively revealed the scientific basis underlying the empirical ancestral performance of the molinillo in the dispersion of cocoa solids, the promotion of liquid (water)–liquid (cocoa fat) mixing, and the production of foam.",

The model coconut milk foulants were immersed in aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solutions at pH range of 7–12. Both model deposits showed little swelling at pH less than 10; increasing pH beyond 10 resulted in a rise of extent of swelling. Proteins and fats in the deposits were removed by NaOH solution. Although some components in the deposits could not be removed by soaking the deposit in NaOH, swollen deposits were less cohesive. Strength of swollen deposits was measured using fluid dynamic gauging (FDG) technique and it was found that the strength decreased with increasing pH of NaOH solution (shear stresses reduced from ∼5 to ∼3.5 Pa). Hence, using NaOH solution at appropriate pHs could improve the cleaning efficiency of coconut milk foulants. However, the strength of the deposit formed from a continuous heat treatment process, which was stronger than that obtained from a batch process, could not be measured using FDG (normal stress ∼800 Pa, shear stress ∼30 Pa). This suggests that other cleaning agents or cleaning conditions should be adopted in cleaning of the deposit formed during continuous heat treatment.",

This study evaluates the feasibility of applying a kiln drying technique to cork planks. We used a sample of 65 planks, each of which was divided into two pieces. One sub-set of planks was air dried for 6 months following the traditional procedure, while the other was kiln dried for 14 days. The evolution of moisture content was controlled, and both methods were compared by means of a statistical analysis of the thickness, quality, porosity coefficient, color and compressive properties of the cork.The reduction in moisture content was similar for both traditional air drying and kiln drying. At the end of the drying, cork thickness increased with both methods, although a larger increase was observed for the kiln drying method. Statistically significant differences were not found for the mean porosity coefficient or quality. Although statistically significant differences in the color of the cork were detected, it would be necessary to verify if such differences are detectable by the human eye. No differences were found in the compressive properties of the cork for a significance level of less than 1%.This feasibility study concludes that kiln drying is a suitable technique as it significantly reduces the drying time and holding costs of the raw material.

     "abstract": "The occurrence of d-amino acids in native and processed plant products is brought into context with the harshness of their treatment condition. It was found that already a small increase in processing harshness such as the milling efficiency of wheat straw or the increased pressure and duration of pumpkin seed oil extraction leads to traceable changes in the overall amino acid content as well as the racemization rate of free and protein bound amino acids. In the top position of our process harshness scale lies the strong alkali and heat-induced extraction of polyphenolic compound lignin from wood and other cellulose-rich plant fibers, e.g. wheat straw, during paper production. Since lignin accumulates in large quantities and its transformation into value-added “bio” products necessitates the recovery of native, functionally preserved lignin, milder pulping methods gain increasing interest. An unexpected drawback of such mild extraction conditions is however the high nitrogen content of such lignin products, which further increase with increasing mildness of the pulping procedure. The presence of amide bands in the FT-IR spectra of such mildly processed lignin has revealed that this nitrogen originated from co-extracted proteins and peptides. The total amino acid content as well as the free amino acid content and the degree of racemization was determined by gas chromatography–ion trap mass spectrometry (GC–Iontrap MS) employing enantiomer labeling for quantification. Cross-determination of the average amino acid content was calculated from nitrogen values obtained by elemental analysis and correlation factors were calculated from measured and calculated data. Since those amino acids with two chiral centers, such as isoleucine, threonine and hydroxyproline exhibit the highest possible diversity in terms of their relative amount to one another as well as their internal enantiomer distribution, this set of two-centered amino acids provided very distinct amino acid pattern, which proofed to be characteristic for the type of plant material as well as the harshness of the different processing conditions.",

Lately, many empirical or semi-empirical mathematical models were presented and discussed for different microorganisms, mainly bacteria, demonstrating an increased need for tools able to quantify the parameters of the microbial inactivation. A. ocharaceus HPCD inactivation was adequately described by first order reaction kinetics and a synergic effect of pressure and temperature was noticed for the experimental range where pressure varied from 5.4 to 7.0 MPa and temperature varied from 30 to 50 °C. The decimal reduction time (D) ranged from 47.07 min at 5.4 MPa and 30 °C to 5.04 min at 7.0 MPa and 50 °C. In this study three mathematical models were evaluated in order to find the best one that describes accurately the influence of pressure and temperature on the studied microbial response.

Solid-state fermentation was carried out on four different lignocellulosic materials (sugarcane bagasse, corn cobs, coconut husks and candelilla stalks) as matrix support and production of ellagitannase enzyme was evaluated. All lignocellulosic materials were characterized in terms of water absorption index and critical humidity point. The best lignocellulosic materials for ellagitannase production were sugarcane bagasse and corn cobs (1400 U L−1 and 1200 U L−1, respectively). The lowest values were obtained with candelilla stalks (500 UL-1). The highest specific productivity was obtained with corn cobs (2.5 U mg−1 h−1) which enable increase ellagitannase productivity up to 140 times. Corn cobs have great potential as support matrix for production of fungal ellagitannase in SSF.",

The carbohydrate composition of the product of the PBR with immobilized enzyme was comparable to that of the batch reactor with free enzyme. The stability of the immobilized enzyme at a lactose concentration of 38% (w/v) and at 50 °C was very high: the half-life time of the immobilized enzyme was approximately 90 days. The enzymatic productivity of GOS production using immobilized enzyme in a PBR can be more than six times higher than that of GOS production with free enzyme in a batch reactor. Besides, when aiming for an equal volumetric productivity to the batch process in designing a PBR, the volume of the PBR can be much smaller than that of the batch reactor, depending on the enzyme dosage and the run time of a single batch.",

Extracts from rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), well known as an herbal tea and food and beverage supplement, have shown significant potential for the treatment of various lifestyle conditions, but poor extraction of soluble matter limits its potential value and put limited supplies under pressure. This study demonstrates that pre-treatment with food-grade cellulase, ferulic acid esterase and/or pectinase increased the soluble solid yield from green and fermented rooibos when preparing an infusion, whereas ferulic acid esterase and β-glucanase/β-xylanase increased the total polyphenol yield. A combination of β-glucanase/β-xylanase and pectinase increased the yield of soluble solids from fermented rooibos in industrial evaluations by 33%. Although the total polyphenol and antioxidant content was reduced due to the extraction of ‘inactive’ sugar moieties, the extract exceeded industry benchmarks for both quality parameters. Furthermore, a clear extract was produced with no detrimental impact on its sensory attributes. Although the enzyme treatment reduced the aspalathin content of the extract, there was a concomitant increase in its flavone counterpart, isoorientin, which has significant pharmaceutical value for the treatment of both types of diabetes mellitus.",

TPP is a relatively novel bioseparation technique used for the extraction, concentration and purification of enzymes and natural products. The technique of TPP was explored for the extraction of ursolic acid (UA) and oleanolic acid (OA) from O. sanctum leaves. The influence of various process parameters (pH, ammonium sulfate saturation, crude extract to t-butanol ratio, time and feed loading) on the extraction efficiency was investigated to get highest yield. The optimized conditions were found to be as follows: time – 120 min, pH – 7, ammonium sulfate saturation – 50% w/v, crude extract to t-butanol ratio – 1:1 and feed loading – 7.5% w/v. The highest yield obtained for UA and OA was 79.48% and 80.67% respectively under optimized conditions of TPP. Compared with TPP higher yield (83.36% and 85.58%) was obtained by ultrasound assisted TPP (UATPP) at 40 kHz and 180 W power and the time required was only 14 min as compared to 120 min of TPP.

It was observed that α-la concentrated in the PEG phase while β-lg concentrated in the NaPA phase. Response surface methodology was applied to optimize protein partitioning and to achieve the best conditions for their fractionation. Thermodynamic analysis based on isothermal titration microcalorimetry indicated that the partitioning of α-la was accompanied by endothermic heat and was entropically driven, while β-lg partitioning was accompanied by exothermic heat and was enthalpically driven at low polymer concentrations and entropically driven at high polymer concentrations.

Mass transfer and reaction limitations on bioconversion in the 1200 L reactor was studied based on a central composite design of experiments constructed using the superficial air velocity and solid substrate composition as variables and lovastatin production as response. The surface response prediction showed a maximum lovastatin production of 1.86 mg g−1 dry substrate on day 5 of the bioconversion process when the reactor was operated using 0.19 vvm airflow rate (23.37 cm min−1 superficial air velocity) and 54% substrate composition (wC). Lovastatin production did not increase significantly with superficial air velocity in the 7 L reactor. Variation in temperature and exit CO2 composition was recorded, and the Damköhler number was calculated for lovastatin production at these two scales. The results showed that in larger reactors mass transfer limitation controlled bioconversion while in smaller reactors bioconversion was controlled by reaction rate limitations. In addition, mass transfer limitations in larger reactors reduced the rate of metabolic heat removal, resulting in hot spots within the substrate bed.",

     "abstract": "During radio frequency (RF) processing, the size of sample between RF electrodes has certain effect on power absorption and heating rates. Hence, certain load sizes might be required for effective RF processes for temperature evolution. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of sample size on power absorption and heating rate during RF heating. For this purpose, a 3-dimensional multi-physics model was used for various load volumes in two configurations. In the first configuration, distance between RF electrodes was fixed while air gap between sample's surfaces and electrodes was fixed in the second configuration. The smaller the load volume, the larger the air gap and the slower the heating rate of sample due to the behavior of electric field in the first case. The smallest volume in the second case, however, was heated much faster via the deflection of electric field by top–bottom edges increasing net electric field in the sample with the effect of shorter air gap distance. The results indicated that the sample load volume is rather important, and it might be possible to obtain optimal tuning of RF cavities to allow a high heating efficiency by changing the distance between electrodes.",

Instability processes operated in the emulsions bulk, being flocculation the main one. Droplet size and viscosity influenced the emulsions stability. An increase in viscosity attained by the addition of MD delayed the global destabilization processes. Emulsion properties and stability were similar between the formulations containing sucrose or trehalose. Also, there were no differences regarding aroma retention or sensorial perception of citral.

In this work, we examined the effect of biological ageing of white wine on its nitrogen composition (viz. amino acids, urea and ammonium ion, which constitute the main sources of nitrogen for acetic bacteria during the acetification process) with a view to confirming the suitability of aged wine for producing quality vinegar.Available nitrogen contents in biologically aged wine were lower than in young (unaged) wine; this resulted in a slightly lower acetification rate and production with the former. The nitrogen composition of the two vinegars was very similar, with l-proline and l-cysteine as the major amino acids. By exception, only the vinegar from the young wine contained ammonium ion. The ageing process by flor yeast produces urea which is eliminated by the bacteria in the next stage.Available nitrogen for use by acetic bacteria in biologically aged wine is seemingly no limiting factor for acetification. The problem posed by the formation of urea during wine ageing was suppressed by the subsequent acetification process. The study could be an example of how different microorganisms use the available substrate in serial biotransformations.",

Fish and fish processing by-products represent the major source of lipids rich in omega-3. The present work focuses on the supercritical CO2 fractionation of fish oil derivatives for obtaining omega-3 concentrates, which seems a promising process given that it allows utilizing low temperatures (well below 100 °C) and it can be performed also at industrial scale. The process was conceived, modeled, and evaluated in terms of the main parameters affecting its performances: solvent to feed ratio, reflux ratio, temperature, and pressure of both the fractionation column and the column head separator.The process was further optimized minimizing its operating costs. The optimum foresaw operating the column at high temperature (80 °C) and pressure (19.5 MPa), which allowed for a reduced reflux ratio (=0.92) and solvent to feed ratio (=63). At these conditions, the process cost per unit product (omega-3 concentrate) turned out to be of about 2.3 €/kg.Finally, the plant was designed for three different throughputs: 10, 100, and 300 kg/h. This allowed estimating the investment costs, in order to outline a preliminary process feasibility evaluation.",

     "abstract": "Characterization of protein solubility in downstream processing steps is important to either prevent protein aggregation, e.g. during inclusion body refolding, hydrophobic interaction chromatography and formulation or to decrease solubility, e.g. for selective precipitation or crystallization. In general we distinguish between thermodynamic solubility at equilibrium and kinetically driven apparent solubility.In our study we used a high throughput screening method established on a liquid handling robot to rapidly assess an apparent solubility of lysozyme and its dependence on parameters such as pH, ionic strength and additive concentration. Combinatorial effects were measured in a reasonable amount of time with high data density and low material consumption.Parameter interactions were observed between solvent pH and temperature. With increasing margin of pH from the isoelectric point, the effect of temperature was more pronounced. In addition, we found an influence of ionic strength on the additive induced changes in apparent solubility for all systems. PEG 300 and Tween 20 improved lysozyme apparent solubility at high salt concentrations. For sorbitol and sucrose, two distinct regions of maximum apparent solubility were found depending on the additive concentration. While an explanation for single parameter effects was possible, e.g. for pH by correlating net charge and solubility, this became difficult with increasing number of parameters. By reducing the experimental effort, it was possible to build a solid data basis to elucidate the mechanism of lysozyme aggregation and to find industrial relevant regions of increased solubility. Our approach is thus a powerful tool not only for process optimization but also for an increased understanding of precipitation.",

The processing of these macromolecular assemblies raises new challenges not previously encountered for simpler protein therapeutics. Microbial expression of viral precursor protein complexes (capsomeres) and their subsequent cell-free self-assembly represent a new and technologically interesting pathway to VLP vaccines, yet significant scientific and engineering challenges remain. Among these, the use of thrombin within the existing laboratory process must be eliminated, for regulatory, cost and product quality reasons. Here, the use of alternatives to thrombin is explored. It is shown that tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp) is a viable alternative to thrombin, and leads to higher-quality VLP product; as TEVp has no known human physiological or biochemical role, its bioprocessing acceptability is expected to be higher than for thrombin. The results presented here enhance the scale-up potential of microbial VLP processing, and suggest that TEVp may be a preferable enzyme for use in other bioprocess settings, including those related to the processing of less complex biologics.",

     "abstract": "Ion exchange processes are widely used in the food, bioprocessing and related industries for the isolation of proteins and other ionic species. Traditional ion exchange resins require salts, acids or bases for releasing adsorbed molecules creating a strong saline waste stream with negative environmental and economic impact. Stimuli responsive polymers (SRPs) with ion exchange functional groups can be used to selectively capture and release charged molecules from a complex mixture using physical stimuli to trigger conformational transitions in the polymer. The structural change of the polymers in response to a stimulus may lead to reduced ligand–target molecule interaction resulting in the release of the captured molecule without the use of chemical reagents, thereby reducing the environmental burden associated with ion exchange processes. The use of temperature responsive polymers has already been demonstrated for such applications at analytical scale. However, little progress has been made to extend these discoveries to the development of materials and methods amenable to industrial scale processing. So far, other SRPs such as, electric, magnetic and light responsive polymers remain largely unexplored for such application. This article discusses the potential of temperature responsive and other SRPs for developing sustainable ion exchange processes. It also highlights the material science and engineering challenges that need to be overcome to bring such processes to industrial application.",

The polymers obtained were tested against a protein mixture containing LF, and the recovery efficiency was calculated determining the diminution of LF from the supernatant by titration of the iron of the LF, as well as native PAGE to determine the protein composition of the supernatants. The only polymer which was able to specifically bind LF was MIP1 (vinylpirydin alone). Measuring the proportions of the different proteins in the mixture, it was demonstrated that before the separation with MIP1, LF represented 81.9% of the total protein content of the mixture, and diminished to 70.5% after the exposure to MIP1, suggesting that LF was specifically sorbed by this polymer. The retention efficiency of the polymer showed that MIP1 retained 34.5% of the total LF content, while its control did not retain any, demonstrating that the retention of the protein is not due to unspecific adsorption in the polymer, but rather to a selective retention in the cavity formed by the template.",

The integrated use of process experimentation and modeling enables sufficient process understanding to be gained during process development such that the optimal SMCC design is found even with limited time and materials. The application of the approach is demonstrated by determining the optimal SMCC design that maximizes the capture of human IgG by a silica-based protein A adsorbent named AbSolute. For this example, the optimum productivity was found to increase from 2.9 kg L−1 day−1 for batch operation to 4.0 kg L−1 day−1 for SMCC operation with three columns. A second case study considering a hypothetical adsorbent of larger particle size and slower mass transfer is also presented, to further demonstrate the applicability of the integrated approach.

Laboratory tests have an important role in guiding industrial trials, and this paper introduces and compares two experimental techniques developed for studying CIP mechanisms: local phosphorescence detection (LPD), and scanning fluid dynamic gauging (sFDG).To illustrate the comparison, each technique is used to investigate the influence of soil topology on the cleaning of pre-gelatinised starch-based layers from stainless steel (SS 316) substrates by aqueous NaOH solutions at ambient temperature. The roughness of the soil surface is varied by incorporating zinc sulphide particles with different particle size distributions (range 1–80 μm) into the starch suspensions. The soil roughness increased with the use of larger particles, increasing the 3D arithmetic mean roughness (Sa) of the dry layers (range 0.37–3.33 μm). Rough layers were cleaned more readily than those containing small inclusions, with a good correlation between the cleaning rates observed during LPD and FDG measurements. The LPD technique, which is an instrumented CIP test, gives a better indication of the cleaning time, while sFDG measurements provide further insight into the removal mechanisms.",

The flour samples were obtained using a fixed-bed drying process at 60 °C. The BET monolayer procedure was used for the desorption analysis. The Halsey, Henderson, Oswin, Smith, BET and GAB models were fitted to the sorption data. All flours exhibited type II isotherms that were almost superimposed, indicating that the ripening stage of the banana did not alter the hygroscopic behavior of the products. According to the adsorption isotherms, the flour has microbiological stability (aw < 0.6) at moisture contents below 13 g H2O/100 g dry base (d.b.). The monolayer moisture content indicated that the drying process of the ‘Nanicão’ banana should not proceed to moisture content lower than 7.10 g H2O/100 g d.b. to avoid unnecessary power consumption. A type-H3 hysteresis between the adsorption and desorption isotherms of flour was observed. The Oswin, Smith and GAB models provided the best fit for the flour adsorption and desorption data.",

This work was aimed to optimize the encapsulation process, characterize the physicochemical properties of microcapsules, and evaluate the storage stability and in vitro release performance.

Phycocyanin/alginate/chitosan microcapsules (PACM) were found to have compact spherical shape with mean diameters of 1.03 mm, whereas phycocyanin/alginate microspheres (PAM) were internal porous spherical appearances with mean diameters of 1.81 mm. Storage stability study showed that encapsulation by alginate and chitosan conferred greater ability to phycocyanin against temperature during storage. In vitro release study revealed that both PAM and PACM could be resistant against acidic environment, and would rapidly release phycocyanin under mild alkali condition. The sustained-release profile of phycocyanin from PACM was superior to that from PAM.",

     "abstract": "Fruit leathers are pectic gels, eaten as snack or dessert, obtained by dehydrating fruit purees. In this work, apple leathers were prepared by a hot-air drying process which allows the formation of a gel, following the “saccharide–acid–high methoxyl pectin” gelation mechanism. Leathers were produced at 50, 60 and 70 °C, from two formulations: control and added with potassium metabisulphite (KM) as antioxidant. The drying process was studied applying a diffusive model, while antioxidant capacity (AC) losses were represented by a first-order model. Activation energy for drying (20.6 kJ/mol) was lower than those estimated for AC losses in control (31.5 kJ/mol) and KM-added (37.9 kJ/mol) leathers. Therefore, the drying time reduction achieved by increasing air temperature is not sufficient to decrease AC losses in the range covered. AC retention decreased in both formulations at increasing air temperature. KM-added samples showed higher AC retention than the controls, except for those dried at 70 °C. Kinetic constants were lower for KM-added samples, suggesting a protective effect of the additive, especially at moderate air temperatures. In the most favorable situation, AC retention was of only 16%. Therefore, the functional character of these products may not be preserved if dried with hot air and the research on economically viable, less-severe drying technologies should be intensified.",

As protein/glycerol ratio increases from 50/50 to 65/35, the mechanical spectra display a dramatic increase (i.e. 15,000-fold in the storage modulus at 1 rad/s), as a greater degree of structuration is achieved. An evolution from a predominantly viscous behaviour into a predominantly elastic one is also observed (i.e. the loss tangent shifts from 1.9 to 0.3 at 1 rad/s).When the viscoelastic properties were studied along ageing, a relaxation related minimum was found at relatively short times, which could define the optimal condition for bioplastic processing (e.g. injection moulding). Freezing also plays an important role by inhibiting ageing and strongly retarding the evolution of G′ and G″ along ageing time after thawing. When samples are submitted to a thermal treatment up to 90 °C, a minimum is always found both in G′ and G″ that takes place at lower temperature as the protein/glycerol ratio increases (from 62 to 49 °C).",

Incorporation of protein co-precipitates improves the functional (e.g. appearance, texture, and stability) and nutritional characteristics of many food products. Increasing world population, increasing demand for and cost of protein-rich foods, and the continuing need to improve the nutritional and functional properties of protein ingredients have contributed to greater research into blends or composites as food ingredients. Protein co-precipitates have a range of biological, physical, chemical, functional, sensory and nutritional properties giving the potential application as ingredients in the food industry, though relatively little published information is available on this subject. There is limited information about the use of protein co-precipitates by the food industry when developing products for different groups of potential consumers. The aim of this review is to evaluate the current status of protein co-precipitate research as a potential way of improving utilization of protein rich raw materials (e.g. dairy protein), oil seed meals (e.g. sesame, soybean, flaxseed and canola) and by-products (e.g. brewing yeast). By blending proteins from different sources, protein co-precipitates are a way of overcoming deficiencies in essential amino acid contents found in proteins from a single source, which giving ingredients with good functional properties and desirable sensory characteristics.",

DLC (diamond-like carbon) coatings, namely a-C:H, a-C:H:Si and a-C:H:Si:O, were fouled at an initial surface temperature of 80 and 120/105 °C and the impact of the surface modification on the fouling resistance, the amount and type of deposit formed and the deposit composition were assessed. The results showed that the surface energy properties affected the first fouling layer formation as well as further stages of build-up and the deposit structure, principally at the lower surface temperature. Moreover the electron donor component significantly influenced the final fouling resistance as well as the deposit mass, suggesting an optimum value of γ− for which deposits have lower adhesive and cohesive strengths and the fouling is minimal.",

Processing raw milk on plate heat exchangers results in significant fouling of proteins as well as minerals, and is exacerbated by the wall heating effect. The surface of 316L stainless steel heat exchanger plates was modified to resist fouling during food processing. An electroless nickel plating process was used to co-deposit fluorinated nanoparticles onto 316L stainless steel. The ability to resist fouling was demonstrated on a pilot plant scale plate heat exchanger. The fluorinated nanoparticle modified steel reduced surface energy from 41.4 to 24.7 mN/m, and reduced foulant accumulation by 97%. The anti-fouling coating was demonstrated to improve heat transfer efficiency. Repeatability studies were performed and confirmed that the EN-PTFE surface coating maintained its anti-fouling properties through 10 independent processing runs. Co-deposition of fluorinated particles during electroless nickel plating represents an effective and commercially scalable method to prepare anti-fouling coatings on stainless steel.",

Lower survival rates were recorded as the outlet air temperature was increased (particularly above 80 °C), although bacteria surviving higher temperatures were more likely to survive storage. L. acidophilus generally showed better survival than E. coli and this is attributed to the thicker cell wall of the Gram positive cell.

Different parts of tomato fruits like whole tomato, peel, pulp and industrial waste were screened for lycopene content. The extraction of lycopene was carried out with four different solvents to know their extraction efficiency. Two step extraction processes was followed for enzyme-assisted extraction of lycopene. In the first step waste samples were treated with enzymes i.e. cellulase and pectinase, whereas in second step extraction of lycopene was carried out by solvent. The optimization study with respect to concentrations and incubation time were carried out for both the enzymes. Also the effect of particle size and cooking methods on recovery of lycopene were studied. The results revealed that the tomato peel (417.97 μg/g) contains highest amount of lycopene followed by industry waste (195.74 μg/g), whole tomato (83.85 μg/g) and pulp (47.6 μg/g). When extraction was carried out by tri-mixture (i.e. acetone, ethanol and hexane) got higher recovery of lycopene than the other solvents. Maximum recovery of lycopene was obtained at 1.5% cellulase and 2% pectinase respectively at 4 h of incubation period. The results also indicated that finer the particle size, higher the recovery of lycopene, whereas all cooking methods reduced the recovery of lycopene.

     "abstract": "In this research a phase equilibrium model to predict the recovery of several aroma compounds in spirits distilled in a traditional Charentais alembic has been developed. Due to the congeners’ quasi-infinite dilution, the properties of the mixture are assumed to be dependent on the ethanol mole fraction only. Thus, the system is treated as a quasi-binary mixture; the ethanol recovery, the dynamics of the condensation and the heat transfer processes are modeled independently of the congener's concentration. The model was calibrated with laboratory data obtained during the elaboration of pear distillates. The concentration of ethanol and 15 congeners in the distillate were measured with gas chromatography during the experiments. Fitting just two parameters, one for heating power and one for heat loss, was sufficient to reproduce the experimental ethanol recovery curves. This allowed an accurate prediction of most of the congener's recovery curves. The prediction of the concentration of five congeners, including acetaldehyde and methanol, are not significantly different from measured values. The prediction of the concentration of six congeners was biased but with relatively small errors (ranging between 8% and 25%). Significantly large prediction biases (more than 30%) were observed for ethyl hexanoate, ethyl decanoate and phenethyl alcohol.",

     "abstract": "Given its low-cholesterol content feature, granules from egg yolk can be used as a substitute of the whole egg yolk. However, the functional properties of the granular fraction should be improved. In this sense, hydrolysis of proteins frequently produces improvements in some of its nutritional and technological properties. For that reason, in this work egg yolk granules were treated with a proteolytic enzyme, trypsin (E.C. 3.4.21.4) with the purpose of making a comparative characterization of the products.Results showed that the enzymatic reaction produced a degree of hydrolysis of 12%, being the size of the different peptides obtained and quantified by chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques. Mayonnaises made with these hydrolysed granules resulted more stable to temperature changes between 4 and 20 °C than the one made with non-hydrolysed ones. In the rheological tests carried out, the mayonnaise elaborated with hydrolysed granules has the most similar rheological behaviour to that of a commercial one used as reference. In general, the results obtained suggest that the recipe elaborated with hydrolysed granules had better rheological characteristics than those prepared using non-hydrolysed granules, maintaining the low-cholesterol feature.",

The results in this study showed that the energy consumption for 400 g fresh banana (about 95 g dried samples) by FD process and MFD process are about 35.73 × 106 J (9.92 kW h) and 21.76 × 106 J (6.57 kW h), respectively. Compared to the traditional FD process, MFD can save up to 35.7% energy and 40% drying time. Increasing the heating power in the secondary drying stage of MFD process had been confirmed to result in decrease in both the energy consumption and drying time. After increasing the microwave power in the secondary drying stage from 1.0 W/g to 1.5 W/g in MFD process, total energy consumption is about 18.12 × 106 J (5.56 kW h) and drying time can be reduced from 360 min to 270 min. The sensory evaluation of produced banana chips at different drying conditions (1.0 W/g, 1.5 W/g and 2.0 W/g) revealed that the sensory properties are acceptable by the customers except the 2 W/g microwave power dried product. Thus, the method that increased the heating powder in the secondary drying stage of the MFD process could potentially be an effective method to reduce the energy consumption without seriously sacrificing the color of the end product.",

     "abstract": "The influence of osmotic dehydration process parameters on the efficiency of water loss and sucrose gain of pumpkins and the influence on the quality of the final product are essential for production of superior quality candied pumpkins. Mass transfer kinetics during osmotic dehydration of pumpkins were modelled by assuming Fickian diffusion of sucrose and water in unsteady state conditions, which described very well the experimental results for water loss and sugar gain. Water and sucrose effective diffusion coefficients increase significantly with temperature. Temperature and sucrose concentration had a significant influence on both water and sugar diffusion, increasing as the solution temperature increased. Significant increase in the effective water diffusivity and decrease in the sucrose effective diffusivity was observed when the sucrose solution concentration increased from 40 °Brix to 50 and 60 °Brix. From 50 to 60 °Brix, no difference in the effective diffusivities was observed. Candied pumpkins with higher sucrose content have a higher breaking stress, less breaking strain and lower work to fracture. Moreover, the product becomes harder and less elastic with increasing sucrose content, resulting in more brittle products, which seems to be related with reinforcement of the pumpkin cell wall matrix.",

The general linear model (GLM) showed that ultrasound input (power and amplitude), osmotic solution concentrations, and immersion time increased the water loss, solid gain, and total colour change of guava slices significantly with P < 0.0005. Indirect sonication in osmotic solutions contributed to high water loss and solid gain with acceptable total colour change than direct sonication. Applying ultrasound pre-osmotic treatment in 70 °Brix prior to hot-air drying reduced the drying time by 33%, increased the effective diffusivity by 35%, and decreased the total colour change by 38%.

Bovine intestine samples were heat pump fluidized bed dried at atmospheric pressure and at temperatures below and above the materials freezing points, equipped with a continuous monitoring system. The investigation of the drying characteristics have been conducted in the temperature range −10 to 25 °C and the airflow in the range 1.5–2.5 m/s. Some experiments were conducted as single temperature drying experiments and others as two stage drying experiments employing two temperatures. An Arrhenius-type equation was used to interpret the influence of the drying air temperature on the effective diffusivity, calculated with the method of slopes in terms of energy activation, and this was found to be sensitive to the temperature. The effective diffusion coefficient of moisture transfer was determined by the Fickian method using uni-dimensional moisture movement in both moisture, removal by evaporation and combined sublimation and evaporation. Correlations expressing the effective moisture diffusivity and drying temperature are reported.Bovine particles were characterized according to the Geldart classification and the minimum fluidization velocity was calculated using the Ergun Equation and generalized equation for all drying conditions at the beginning and end of the trials. Walli's model was used to categorize stability of the fluidization at the beginning and end of the drying for each trial.

Ethanol:water mixtures (20–100%, v/v) were applied to desorb the bioactive compounds from the column filled with Amberlite XAD-7 resin. Flavanol and flavonol content of the eluate were monitored with fast spectrophotometric measurements and these determinations were then validated using chromatographic analysis. The modelling results showed that a three-parameter sigmoid model fitted well to the cumulative flavonoid recovery data and the coefficients of multiple determination were higher than 0.99 for all ethanol proportions. Moreover, the estimated parameters of the model provided qualitative and quantitative desorption information, including the rate of desorption and the maximum recovery value. Interestingly, the rate of desorption presented a linear relationship with the ethanol proportion, while a quadratic behaviour was observed for the maximum recovery. In the optimised condition, four bed volumes of an 80% ethanol–water mixture permitted the desorption of almost 100% of the flavonoids from the column. All fractions presented particularly elevated antioxidant capacity (17.84 ± 5.23 μmol TE/mg GAE), when measured by the oxygen radical antioxidant capacity per total phenolic content.

Shearzyme 500L showed better xylan hydrolysis capacity with high amount of xylose liberation. Xylobiose was the main hydrolysis product in each case. Even though the enzymatic hydrolyses using Shearzyme 500L resulted higher reducing sugar production compared to those of Veron 191, the hydrolysis of complex xylan structures was improved and the production of undesirable xylose was lowered by the co-utilization of xylanase preparations. By the co-utilization of xylanase preparations, the reducing sugar production from wheat straw, corn cob and sunflower stalk originated xylans was increased by 36%, 33% and 13%, respectively, compared to the expected reducing sugar yields. The highest reducing sugar production was obtained from complex corn cob xylan. The depolymerization of cotton and sunflower stalk xylan was poorest even though they have simple structures. Poor utilization of these xylans might be related to their high residual lignin content which might hinder the accessibility of xylan by the xylanases. However, the utilization of sunflower and cotton stalk xylan was improved when they were hydrolyzed within a xylan mixture containing equal amounts of each of five different xylans. In short, XOs production efficiency from agricultural waste materials was improved by the co-utilization of suitable xylanase and/or xylan mixtures considering the heterogeneous structures of xylan and different substrate specificities of xylanases.",

However, formulations with more than one additive resulted in 36–14% less enzymatic activity after 6 months. After lyophilization, FOS synthesis features changed positively, by increasing the FOS yield from a non-lyophilizated yield of 58–68% with lyophilization. FOS composition changed as well, with 1F-fructofuranosyl-nystose (GF4) content increasing to 61% with lyophilization, which is 76 times higher than with the non-lyophilized enzyme.",

The best results were achieved when n-hexane was used as solvent. With operating temperatures in the range −30 °C to −80 °C and a FAMEs-to-solvent ratio of 1:5 (v/v), the proportion of AA methyl ester isolated could be increased to 83.76 ± 2.78% with a yield of 52.89%. The total recovery of AA methyl ester would be further increased to 90.84% by recrystallization of the solid phases. The 20C, 22C saturated fatty acids were enriched by n-hexane or petroleum ether at −30 °C, with concentrations increased 7.5-fold or 7.2-fold compared with their original levels, respectively. In addition, a method that combined alkali and acid catalysis of the transmethylation was the most conducive to the preparation of polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters.",

Two strains of indigenous cider yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Hanseniaspora uvarum) as well as a commercial enzyme combined with a wine dry yeast were tested. The differences between distillates were studied by means of chemical and sensory analysis. According to the results of this study, treatment with enzymes with pectin methylesterase activity led to excessive levels of distilled methanol, and hence it use is not advisable. In contrast, the indigenous yeasts produced lower concentrations of methanol. Moreover, using different yeast species allows the production of spirits with important differences in their aromatic composition, which is certainly interesting from a commercial point of view. Furthermore, the results showed that drying the apple pomace allows it to be preserved in good condition, thus solving the problem of the seasonality of the raw material for making apple pomace distillates.",

     "abstract": "When it is not consumed, bread presents a major source of food waste, both in terms of the amount and its economic value. However, bread also possesses the characteristics of an ideal substrate for solid state fermentation. Yet nearly all wasted bread ends up in landfill sites, where it is converted into methane by anaerobic digestion. Governments are finally taking action and, according to the EU Landfill Directive, for example, biodegradable municipal waste disposed into landfills must be decreased to 35% of 1995 levels, by 2020. Solid state fermentation of waste bread for the production of value added products is a novel idea, which could help with the achievement of this target. In this study, glucoamylase and protease production from waste bread pieces, via solid state fermentation, was investigated in detail. The optimum fermentation conditions for enzyme production were evaluated as, 20 mm particle size, 1.8 (w/w, db) initial moisture ratio, and duration of 144 h. Under these conditions, glucoamylase and protease activities reached up to 114.0 and 83.2 U/g bread (db), respectively. This study confirms that waste bread could be successfully utilised as a primary raw material in cereal based biorefineries.",

While it is recognized that, in general, matter exhibits unique properties when manipulated at the nanoscale, little is known about how reducing the size of the carrier to the nanoscale effects attached lactase. The purpose of this work is to investigate the influence of particle size on activity retention of lactase (Aspergillus oryzae) covalently conjugated to magnetic nanoparticles of varying sizes. Lactase was attached to carboxylic acid functionalized magnetic nanoparticles 18 nm, 50 nm, and 200 nm in diameter using carbodiimide chemistry. After attachment, activity retention was 73%, 39%, and 14% compared to the free enzyme for the 18 nm, 50 nm, and 200 nm conjugates, respectively. The apparent Km was not significantly different as a function of particle size while the apparent kcat decreased with increasing particle size. Reducing the particle size of magnetic nanoparticles can increase the activity retention of conjugated lactase.

     "abstract": "Flaxseed contains numerous bioactive compounds which induce various biological effects. Among bioactive compounds, flaxseed contains 38–45% oil, of which up to 59% is α-linolenic acid. Focus has recently been put on the technical difficulties of processing flaxseed pasta and studies have shown that flaxseed could tolerate some processing conditions. A close link between pasta processing conditions and the in vitro digestion of the food matrix has also been identified. The aim of this study were (1) to understand the impact of flaxseed processing and content on engineering properties of pasta after the extrusion, the drying and the cooking process; (2) to characterize the fatty acids profile of flaxseed-enriched pasta during the processing and after the in vitro digestion. Two processes were considered prior to the incorporation of flaxseed into pasta at levels of 15% and 30% (dry basis): (Process A) conditioning and milling of flaxseed; (Process B) conditioning of flaxseed, oil pressing, milling of flaxseed cake and reformulation. Results showed that pressing oil from flaxseed and then milling the flaxseed cake (Process B) allowed obtaining an average particle size smaller than milling the whole flaxseed (Process A) which doubled the flaxseed-to-semolina particles ratio. Flaxseed processing, prior to the incorporation into pasta, and content had impacts on engineering properties after the extrusion, the drying and the cooking process and, affected the protection and the release of free fatty acids during in vitro digestion. While free fatty acids profiles remained relatively stable through all steps of pasta processing, they were affected by the in vitro digestion. Decrease in the proportion of omega-3 fatty acid (C18:3) was more important for the Process A compared to the Process B.",

     "abstract": "The incorporation of air into a high ratio cake batter by planetary mixing was studied using two bench mixers, a Kenwood KM250 and a Hobart-N50. Power draw (expressed as specific mechanical power input) and air volume fraction, ϕ, were monitored over time for batters prepared in each mixer for heat-treated and un-treated cake flours. The two flour types gave very similar results, indicating that the benefit of heat treatment for cake manufacture is manifested during the baking step. Both mixers gave a rapid initial increase in ϕ up to ∼0.50 followed by a gradual decay. Bubble size distributions of batters prepared in the Hobart showed the initial aeration stage to be accompanied by the formation of a large number of small bubbles, with diameters around 5 μm: the average bubble size increased and number of bubbles decreased with extended mixing. Batters prepared without emulsifier exhibited a steady increase in ϕ to a plateau at ∼0.2 and contained larger bubbles which did not change in average size significantly over time. All batters exhibited power-law shear-thinning behaviour with power law indices and consistency strongly dependent on ϕ. At low shear rates, the apparent viscosity showed the non-linear dependency on ϕ expected for dense suspensions. At higher shear rates, elastic forces generated by the bubble phase became significant. The non-Newtonian nature of the liquid phase and the elasticity generated by the bubbles meant that shear-thinning and bubble break-up could not be predicted by analyses based on the capillary number. The results support a qualitative model of bubble formation and break-up caused by extensional deformation generated by shearing these bubbly liquids: the bubbles cream out slowly owing to the high viscosity of the continuous phase at rest.",

The drying temperature influences strongly the microstructure of dried samples: the porosity increases with the air temperature, but the structure is better preserved at intermediate temperature (60 °C) as confirmed by the lower firmness values with respect to the other dehydrated samples (40, 50 and 70 °C). In these latter, the longer drying time and the higher temperature, respectively, causes the development of a wrinkled structure. In particular, at 70 °C the structure of dehydrated samples appears totally broken with a consequent faster water uptake during rehydration.",

     "abstract": "In this study, moisture and solute variations inside cylindrical green bean samples during osmotic dehydration in salt solution were predicted using a modified lumped mathematical model. The polynomial approximation approach was used to obtain the average moisture and solute concentrations in the radial direction. Results of the proposed model were compared with the experimental data, obtained from osmotic dehydration of long cylindrical samples of green bean in different temperatures and concentrations of salt solution, as well as the exact solution of the original partial differential equation. Results show that the P. A. method's predictions followed the general trend of the experimental dehydration curves. Also dehydration curves show a good agreement between the P. A. and exact analytical method's predictions. The values of mean relative errors between the P. A. method's predictions and experimental data are between 14 and 24%. Also the related mean relative errors for exact analytical method are between 10 and 27.5%. Although the exact analytical solution provides better results, as expected, but considering the approximate nature of the P. A. method and in view of the fact that the deviations of P. A. and the exact analytical methods from the experimental data are comparable, the P. A. method could be used because of its simplicity.",

A second-order model developed for the production of AGI prediction exhibits a F-value of 15.8 and a high value for the coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.933). Under these conditions, the AGI activity of the broth reached 29.4. In comparison with the highest AGI activity (24.3) obtained at the one-factor-at-a-time fermentation condition, the AGI activity increased by 21%. The AGI in the fermentation broth of B. subtilis B2 was also partially purified and determined by HPLC-ELSD.

During the ethanol production step, a considerable amount of byproducts is obtained and treated as waste. Carbon dioxide is one of these byproducts and a substance of interest especially for food industries. Because the production of 1000 kg of ethanol generates approximately 950 kg of CO2, this work intends to analyze a cryogenic distillation process for the production of CO2 by means of computational simulations. The results obtained were in agreement with real operational conditions, achieving CO2 concentrations up to 100% (v/v). With an initial CO2 concentration of 95% (v/v), 7 separation stages were obtained, achieving the limit of 5 stages for higher CO2 concentrations in the raw gas. The effect of initial CO2 concentrations on the final product and the concentration profiles along the column are also presented. In order to optimize the process, it was observed that, for a maximum feed flow of 3333 kg/h (CO2 concentration of 99%), the plant was able to obtain 10.48 kgCO2/kW, recovering about 2828 kgCO2/h at a final product concentration of 99.90% (v/v) at −25 °C.",

Two fractions are separated after the hydrothermal treatment, consisting on an aqueous functional extract containing most soluble bioactive compounds from asparagus by-product, and a fibrous residue that, after being dried, constitutes the asparagus bioactive fibre. The process includes a column purification step, using an adsorbent polymeric resin, which allows aqueous extracts, partially purified to be obtained and enriched in specific compounds (phenolics and/or saponins). All these presentations have been investigated for their biological activity.

The time required for blanching of carrot slices (10 mm thick) using hot water, steam and IR radiation was 5, 3 and 15 min, respectively. Retention of water soluble vitamin C was higher (62%) in IR blanched carrot as compared to water (43%) and steam (49%) blanching. IR blanching reduced the moisture content by 13–23% (absolute). IR blanched samples dried by hybrid mode took ∼45% lesser time compared to water blanched–hot air dried samples. Higher rehydration moisture of dried samples indicated the retention of cell structure during IR blanching. Vitamin C retention was ∼39% higher in IR blanched–hybrid dried slices compared to water blanched–hot air dried.

For this purpose, measurements of wall shear stress were made by an electrochemical method, for different hydrodynamic conditions. On the other hand, cleanability measurements were also performed. The bowl geometry tested presented no dead zones. However, the available space for flow significantly reduces the Reynolds number and turbulence intensity. As a consequence, three areas of increasing contamination appeared throughout the bowl due to the low mean and fluctuating shear stress values. The use of a pulsating flow increases these fluctuations, and thereby reduces the residual contamination.",

The gelling capacity of the protein fractions was studied at pH values of 3 and 7 using oscillatory measurements, mechanical properties and water holding capacity.

At pH 3, the G′–G″ crossover occurred at lower temperatures when compared to pH 7. This behaviour was more accentuated for the 11S fractions due to its capacity to form stronger gels. An increase of drying temperature led to a displacement of the gel point to higher temperatures and decreased the elasticity modulus or gelling capacity of protein fractions. These results were confirmed by the mechanical properties, since at higher temperatures the gels were more fragile and brittle, especially when formed at pH 7.",

The effects of a spherical food particle's diameter relative to the holding tube diameter on the heat transfer rates are investigated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFDs) simulations. As the particle to holding tube diameter ratio (blockage-ratio) increases, higher particle heating rates were usually observed when compared to the heating rates of an unconfined particle. Variations in the non-Newtonian fluid viscosities with shear rate and temperature played important roles in affecting the local Nusselt numbers. Significant effect of the blockage ratio was found on the integrated lethality of the thermal treatment at low particle Reynolds numbers (Rep). For such cases, conventional steady state fluid–particle heat transfer coefficient correlations, applicable when the particle is immersed in an unbounded stream of fluid, may lead to erroneous predictions of integrated lethality of treatment inside the holding tube. The thermal processing of the food particle was compared using two approaches. In the first rigorous approach, the transient and spatial fluid–particle heat flux variations around the sphere were accounted while in the second approach, a constant heat transfer coefficient value was specified as the boundary condition. Even at intermediate Biot number values (4–17), considerable differences between the two approaches could be observed in the conductive heating patterns inside the sphere as well as in the integrated lethalities.",

The effect of the latter is illustrated by experiments with different feed concentrations and permeate-to-feed ratios. The discussion is supported by rejections and mass balance calculations. In both modes flux decreased with concentration and the observed rejections remained constant. Better conditions for reduced flux decline and tendency to a steady value are obtained by cross-flow nanofiltration.

Increasing the shearing action on the plant produces a liquid extract richer in protein; from 25% of dry matter to 31% of dry matter when two additional sections of paddle screw elements are inserted onto the screw profile. However, it leads to higher liquid retention in the alfalfa fibers and thus dehydration of the plant is less efficient. The fibrous residue still contains at least 60% humidity when the alfalfa is highly degraded, whereas less than 47% humidity remain with only one section of bilobe paddle screws on the profile.

DHPM technology was applied to improve the extraction of flavonoids from sweet potato leaves, and its effect was evaluated using six samples under various conditions. Pretreatment with DHPM was found to strengthen the antioxidant activities of the flavonoid, while no treatment or post-treatment with DHPM, produced weaker antioxidant activities. This suggests that the DHPM technology may provide a promising method of utilizing sweet potato leaves as a natural antioxidant in food and pharmaceutical industry.",

Thermorheological properties were evaluated by means of a controlled stress rheometer. All tested doughs showed shear-thinning behaviour in the steady-shear tests (0.001–1 s−1). Oscillatory (1–100 rad s−1 at 0.1% strain), temperature sweep (30–90 °C) and creep-recovery (loading 50 Pa for 60 s) tests showed that flour doughs from chestnuts dried at 85 °C provide interesting properties, particularly remarkable elasticity that is associated with starch gelatinisation.

This study presents a mathematical modeling of the drying curve of raw cork planks in a cork pile in the field, under natural sun drying conditions. Experimental data were obtained by following the water loss (i.e. by daily weighing) of 97 cork planks positioned in nine points within a cork pile. Immediately after harvesting, the raw cork planks had a mean moisture content in a dry basis of 40.4% and after 20-day drying 16.6%. The drying process of the cork planks showed three phases: drying was very fast in the first 2 days; in the next 2–15 days there was a decreasing drying rate; and a final phase, after 15 days in the cork pile, with a slightly decreasing drying rate. Mathematical modeling provided a direct relation between moisture content and drying time. After comparing sixteen empirical drying models, the Modified Henderson and Pabis model showed the best fit. According to this model, the cork planks are commercial dry (14% moisture content in a wet basis) 15 days after harvest.",

The white sorghum had a harder endosperm texture and upon milling produced a coarser granulation compared to the red counterpart. Therefore, the red sorghum produced higher amounts of FAN during liquefaction and the kinetics of these nitrogenous compounds were metabolized faster during the first hours of yeast fermentation. The white and red sorghums yielded 13.6% and 2.7% lower ethanol compared to the maize counterpart. The white sorghum yielded the lowest amount of ethanol likely to its relatively harder endosperm texture that was less susceptible to biocatalysis and yeast fermentation.",

Conventional extraction methods of anthocyanin from plant material are non-selective and yield pigment solutions with large amounts of byproducts such as sugars, organic acids and proteins. Some of these impurities may accelerate anthocyanin degradation. Different extracting media were used and the mixture of 50% (v/v) ethanol and acidified water resulted in maximum anthocyanin content (390.6 mg/L). In order to obtain anthocyanins in a purified form, adsorption was carried out with six different adsorbents. Among these, non-ionic acrylic ester adsorbent, namely Amberlite XAD-7HP, showed the highest adsorption capacity (0.84 mg/mL of resin) and desorption ratio (92.85%). Adsorption results were found to be correlated best using the Langmuir isotherm equation especially at low temperature. The resulting anthocyanin solution after purification was free from sugars, which are the major cause for degradation of anthocyanin. No browning was observed and chroma increased by 27% compared to crude anthocyanin.",

The microstructure of the dried samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy.The application of ultrasound during the convective drying of eggplant led to a significant reduction of the drying time. The ultrasonic effect was dependent on the power applied, thus, the higher the power, the faster the moisture loss. The microstructure of eggplant endocarp was greatly affected during conventional air drying, probably due to the long drying times. This microstructure was better preserved after the application of a moderate ultrasonic power (45 W), due to the shorter drying time and the mild mechanical effects of ultrasound on the endocarp cells.",

As a previous step, the samples were dehydrated to five different values of moisture content (20, 25, 29, 34 and 38 wt% w.b. approximately).

Six commercial lipases from different sources were screened for their ability to incorporate caprylic acid into the canola oil. The sn-1,3 regiospecificity toward the glycerol backbone of canola oil of the lipases with relatively higher acidolysis activity was compared by investigating the fatty acid profiles of the products. The results showed that Lipozyme RM IM from Rhizomucor miehei resulted in the highest caprylic acid incorporation ability and the lowest acyl migration. The reaction parameters including substrate mole ratio, enzyme load, reaction time and temperature of Lipozyme RM IM were investigated. Incorporation of caprylic acid was higher when reactions were carried with 10% lipase of the total weight of substrates with a 1:4 mole ratio of oil and caprylic acid. The optimal time course and temperature for synthesis SLs were 15 h and 50–60 °C. Possible triacylglycerol species and physical properties of the SLs product obtained at relative optimal conditions were characterized.",

This process aims to substitute high calorie sugars of Malay apples for a low calorie natural sweetener. In a first stage, high calorie sugars (sucrose, fructose and glucose) are partially removed from the fruit samples and in a second stage, low calorie sugars (stevioside and rebaudioside) are incorporated to the fruit to maintain its sweetness. The use of ultrasound was evaluated on both stages of the D3S process. Best performance of the process was obtained by subjecting the fruit samples to ultrasound in the sugar removal stage followed by immersion of the samples in Stevia-based solution with application of ultrasound in the sweetener incorporation stage. These operating conditions resulted in the highest sugar removal during the first stage, highest water loss during the process and highest sweetener incorporation during the second stage of the D3S process.",

This drying mode has been achieved within a climatic tunnel blower. This laboratory device permitted us to achieve several tests for different conditions of the apple slices drying. In the intermittent case, a variation of the air temperature and air velocity values permitted us to find the most economic velocities for the drying of the apple thin slices. The numerical simulations in the intermittent tests, give us more information on what really happens to the product during periods of interruption. The drying kinetics at the resumption increases with the air temperature. Then, we gain in energy and in overall drying time. These studies show the considerable advantages of the intermittent drying of agricultural products and confirm the preservation of their qualities and the reduction of the drying time.",

     "abstract": "This study involves comparing key quality parameters (size, textural) of commercially available breakfast cereal granola with product produced by high shear and fluidised bed granulation processes. Impeller rotational speed was found to be the single most important process parameter which influences granola physical and textural properties in the production of high shear granola. In a fluidised bed granulation process nozzle air pressure and binder spray rate were both found to affect aggregate quality attributes. Overall, the high shear granulation process led to larger, denser, less porous and stronger (less likely to break) aggregates compared with the fluidised bed process.Commercial granola samples were compared with the granola produced in this study and showed a large variation in terms of size and textural properties across the brands investigated. Depending in the type of granola required (for example, to be sold as a stand alone breakfast cereal or as accompaniment to yogurt) different manufacturing processes and process parameters may be recommended. The insights gained from this work can aid in developing processes for the production of granola or similar products to match with consumer and manufacture expectations and requirements.",

Aggregation behavior and kinetics of protein precipitation and aggregate formation were analyzed as a function of four process parameters: pH (3.0–5.5), temperature (50–70 °C), reaction time (0–180 min) and protein concentration (10–29%). The precipitation and aggregation of α-LA appeared rate-limited, with a logarithmic dependence of time and possible bimodal nucleation rate, and varied considerably with pH and temperature. Aggregates as large as ∼300 μm were noted after 120 min at pH 4, 60 °C. Processing parameters were optimized to obtain both a high aggregate yield and optimal composition of the aggregate fraction. The optimally enriched solid and liquid fractions contained 58% α-LA and 76% β-LG, respectively, with 99% and 74% recovery ratios. Over the pH range studied, β-LG aggregation was found negligible at 60 °C and β-LG recovery in the aggregates attributed to liquid holding. Increasing WPI concentration accelerated α-LA aggregation, demonstrating a concentration-dependent aggregation mechanism, and reduced aggregate purity. Enriched whey protein fractions are valuable health-enhancing food ingredients.",

Unlike the case of Haematococcus pluvialis cysts, the study of other AXA-producing vegetative microalgae as alternative AXA sources has been minimal, because of inefficient AXA extraction yield and difficulty in separating chlorophyll and AXA. In this study, a novel method was developed to extract AXA from a vegetative green microalga (Monoraphidium sp. GK12) and to separate chlorophyll and AXA using a supercritical-CO2 extraction (SCE) and acid treatment. AXA in the microalgal biomass was extracted completely by SCE, while simple ethanol soaking could not extract AXA well. The addition of ethanol as a co-solvent improved AXA extraction yield. The method employed low CO2 pressure and reaction temperature as well as a short reaction time, making it energy-efficient. Chlorophyll in AXA-containing extract was easily removed by acid addition (H2SO4 or HCl) and centrifugation. Since those acids can be neutralized by alkaline, which produces nontoxic salt, and AXA in the extract can be condensed by reducing pressure, the developed method is expected to stimulate commercialization of a vegetative microalga as an alternative AXA source for food applications.",

The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined against planktonic cells and the anti-biofilm activity was verified against bacterial cells adhered in the wells of polystyrene microplates.

For both bacterial species, a solution containing 2% (v/v) of C. cassia EO was effective against the biofilm formed under static conditions, because the counts obtained were below the detection level of the plate count method employed. Although the biofilm of L. monocytogenes showed a decreased number of adhered cells after formation under agitating conditions (p < 0.05), it was surprisingly more resistant to the EO of C. cassia than the biofilm formed under static conditions (p < 0.05). All of the EOs and combinations tested presented antibacterial activity, almost against planktonic cells; however, the EO of C. cassia showed to be the most effective as a potential agent for the production of sanitizers for biofilm control in the food industries.",

Food processing industries rely on high product throughput as well as excellent CIP ability of equipment used to package foods and beverages. Detailed investigations were undertaken on velocity, pressure distribution, wall shear stress and turbulence intensity with a view to increase the valve performance. The original valve is of cylindrical type and therefore, initial attempts were considered keeping the cylindrical shape but raising the valve stem by 10 mm, changing the angle of the inlet tube from 30° to 37° and lengthening the outlet tube by 7 mm. All showed improved mass flow, reduction of cavitation but failed to increase the CIP performance. Then, attempts were made using semi-spherical configuration. Computer simulation has shown that the cleanability by CIP of the redesigned fill valve has been significantly improved which could not be achieved by cylindrical shape. The redesigned fill valve also has an improved flow capability of 47% over the original design when operated at the same pressure, and approaching 60% when operated at equivalent internal pressure drops.",

     "abstract": "The local shear flow behaviour of bread dough has been studied using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A simulated power-law model together with a wall slip boundary condition agreed satisfactorily with experimental observations for tube flow geometry. Lower shear strain rates were shown to promote greater damage to the dough's microstructure. Predictions revealed that dough remained fairly undamaged near the centreline of the flow field, as the critical strain limit for failure (γ ∼ 20) was not achieved, suggesting a process model should include an element of viscoelasticity. Flow behaviour through a sudden contraction suggested that shearing plays a significant role in the orientation of the gluten network within dough. Further, extremely high shear strain rates were predicted within the geometry which highlighted the usefulness of CFD in identifying unstable process regions and the need for a model that includes such conditions. The results demonstrate the potential of CFD to allow development of a model that links process variables and the microstructure of dough for application for process control and the modernisation of the bread-making process.",

The esterase production was investigated in solid-state fermentation experiment using various fish processing waste meal. Among the tested fish processing wastes, red grouper waste emerged as the best source for higher esterase production. The suitable surfactant and triglyceride identified to increase the lipase production was neem oil. Effect of individual carbon and nitrogen sources supplementation on esterase production revealed that fructose and peptone aided the higher esterase production than the other tested carbon and nitrogen sources. The suitable concentration of sodium chloride for higher esterase production was at 5%. Effect of surfactants and trace elements on esterase production showed that Tween 20 and zinc sulphate, respectively produced maximum amount of esterase. The effect of physical parameters on lipase production revealed that 50 °C temperature and pH 7–8 were optimum for higher esterase production. Statistical optimization with Plackett–Burman design showed that neem oil, NaCl and fructose were found to be the most predictive factors for esterase production by this strain.",

It was observed that tissue damage in sugar beet was most influenced by total energy input and electric field strength. Furthermore, the energy consumption for cell disintegration by PEF treatment was significantly lower compared to thermal treatment indicating average values of about 8 kJ kg−1 and 156 kJ kg−1 respectively.

     "abstract": "Systematic experiments were carried out to optimize the distillation process of Chinese liquor through an industrial-scale distiller. Effect of the operation conditions on the yield and quality of the liquor, and variation of liquor components during distillation were investigated. The steam flowrate of 1.60 kg/min gives the best yield and quality, suggesting there exists an optimal flowrate for the distillation. The yield and quality of the liquor drops down obviously with the increase of bulk density, implying that the fermented grains should be loosely packed. Increasing the bed height from 600 to 1250 mm enhances the yield and quality, indicating that current distiller (commonly used bed height from 700 to 900 mm) has great potential of improvement. Adding small amount of edible alcohol in the steam boiler is proven to increase the liquor yield, but excess amount causes the quality degraded sharply. The liquor-vapor leaking is found to commonly occur at the initial stage of distillation process and dramatically decrease the yield and quality. A simple method is proposed to eliminate the leaking effectively. The gas chromatography analysis results show that the variation of flavor compounds during distillation is closely related to their dissolving properties in ethanol.",

Porosity exhibited a nonlinear variation with respect to moisture content. Volume change showed, as expected, a linear variation with moisture content.

At stage one, the recovery patterns were predicted as a function of SPE eluent concentration in ethanol (10–50%). At stage two, the accuracy of the predictions was increased by enlarging the SPE eluent regressor's range (0–100% ethanol in water) and arranging the solvent system into three practical elution groups.

Surface fluxes due to diffusion and flow (blowing) are computed for both vapor and heat from which transfer coefficients are obtained. As evaporation increases with heating, vapor flux due to pressure-driven flow increases but remains small compared with diffusive flux. Vapor accumulation at the interface increases the diffusive flux, leading to an 8% increase in mass transfer coefficient. Heat transfer at the interface occurs through both conduction and flow, and the heat transfer coefficient shows a slight decrease (10%) as blowing increases with heating.

It was a strong function of the stirrer speed but remained almost invariant with transmembrane pressure drop. The steady state permeate flux increased with pressure drop as well as the stirrer speed. 45% average recovery of Stevioside was obtained during stirred steady state experiments at lower operating pressures (276 and 414 kPa).

     "abstract": "White cabbages (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata) are important sources of dietary fiber (DF) and glucosinolates, which are claimed to possess anticarcinogenic activity. Although the potential use of cabbage outer leaves as starting raw materials to produce functional dietary fiber powder (DFP) has been reported, the effects of various processing steps that are necessary to produce the powder have not been systematically investigated. To allow minimization of losses of glucosinolates during production of DFP the effects of processing steps, i.e., slicing, blanching and drying, on the changes of total glucosinoltates in cabbage outer leaves were investigated; the changes of DFP compositions and color were also investigated. It was noted that the preparation steps did not lead to any significant changes of the DFP compositions. On the other hand, steam blanching was noted to better preserve glucosinolates than water blanching. Drying methods and conditions did not lead to any significant effect on the DFP compositions; however vacuum drying led to better retention of glucosinolates. Color of the DFP was not affected by the drying methods and conditions. The results suggested that cabbage outer leaves should be prepared into DFP by steam blanching prior to slicing in combination with vacuum drying at 80 °C.",

     "abstract": "The utilization of waste from fish processing industry for production of value added products has attracted substantial attention. Tiger-toothed croaker (Otolithes ruber) and Pink perch (Nemipterus japonicus) are used for surimi production and have the potential of abundant supply of raw skins and bones. In order to evaluate the waste from Tiger-toothed croaker and Pink perch as a source of gelatin, the gelatin was extracted from skin and bones and its rheological and functional properties were examined. The skins of Tiger-toothed croaker and Pink perch yielded 7.56% and 5.57% gelatin, whereas their bones yielded 4.57% and 3.55% respectively indicating skin as an important source for gelatin production. The gel strength of gelatins from the skins and bones of Tiger-toothed croaker (170 g and 140 g respectively) were found higher than Pink perch skin and bone gelatins (150 g and 130 g respectively). Similarly, the viscosity, melting point, emulsifying capacity and stability, foaming capacity and stability, and water holding capacity of gelatin extracted from Tiger-toothed croaker were in general greater than those of the gelatin from Pink perch and the values of skin gelatin were higher compared to bone gelatin in both the species. Hydroxyproline contents in skin and bone of Tiger-toothed croaker were 7.77 and 7.51 mg/g and in Pink perch they were 7.63 and 7.41 mg/g respectively. It can be concluded from the present study that Tiger-toothed croaker skin is a prospective source to produce gelatin in good yield with desirable functional properties comparable to commercially available mammalian gelatins.",

     "abstract": "Structural studies of biological macromolecules often require deuterated proteins, necessitating an effective bioprocessing strategy for high yield deuteration and purification. The fermentation and bioseparation studies reported here concern deuterated human protein galectin-2 mutant C57M (hGal-2), a protein showing potential for therapeutic applications. Using the vector pET-28a and a defined D2O based minimal medium with glycerol as the sole carbon source and kanamycin for selection, we have demonstrated that a high density of Escherichia coli expressing deuterated protein at a bench bioreactor scale (7 L) can be achieved, with due attention to prevention of oxygen limitation. Yields achieved were 58 g/L biomass (wet weight) containing 0.7 g/L hGal-2. Affinity chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography were combined to achieve high purity as well as removal of hGal-2 aggregates, giving an overall yield of 1200 mg deuterated hGal-2. The deuterated hGal-2 was characterized and compared with the non-deuterated protein by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), HPLC, N-terminal sequencing, mass spectrometry (MS) and a dot blot immunoassay, showing that deuteration and subsequent purification did not impact the lactose binding and antibody recognition abilities of hGal-2. MS for both intact and trypsin-digested hGal-2 demonstrated that the extent of labeling of non-exchangeable hydrogen atoms by deuterium was (66 ± 1)%, which provides sufficient contrast variation for structural studies using small angle neutron scattering. The fermentation and bioseparation method established in this work can be applied to process other deuterated proteins with high yield and purity, opening the way to advanced structural studies.",

Therefore we developed the mathematical model of pineapple rings during combined far-infrared radiation and air convection drying to investigate the evolutions of moisture content and qualities. The drying model based on the solution of Fick's law was used to estimate moisture diffusion coefficient (D). The D values with and without taking into account shrinkage phenomenon of dried products were compared. The kinetics of dried pineapple qualities such as color, shear force ratio and shrinkage during drying also were studied. Pineapples were pretreated, cut into rings and dried at far-infrared intensities of 1–5 kW/m2 combined with air temperatures of 40–60 °C and air velocities of 0.5–1.5 m/s. The D values were found to increase with increasing intensity and air temperature. The D values with shrinkage consideration were lower than the D values without shrinkage consideration for all drying conditions. The quartic model gave a better fit over the other three polynomial models for describing the color kinetics. The thin layer drying models such as Page, Henderson and Pabis, Logarithmic and Midilli–Kucuk were modified in order to describe shear force ratio (SFR) of dried pineapple. The statistically analyses from this present study indicated that modification of drying models can be used to describe the kinetics of SFR and Midilli–Kucuk's form gave a better fit over the other form. The quadratic model was better than the linear model to predict shrinkage kinetics for all four dimensions (outer radius, inner radius, thickness and volume) of pineapple rings.",

The isokinetic temperature Tβ was 376.13 K which was larger than the harmonic mean temperature Thm = 307.31 K, showing that the water sorption was entropy-driven. The free energy change ΔG was positive (+38.42 kJ/kg) indicating a non-spontaneous water sorption process.",

Osmotic dehydration (55°Brix solution at 40 °C for 90 min) combined with microwave assisted air drying (MWAD) was tested on smooth cayenne pineapples. The influence of the four most relevant processing parameters (osmotic treatment time, microwave power, air temperature and air velocity) was studied using a 24 circumscribed central composite experimental design. The product quality was evaluated in terms of charred appearance at the surface, moisture content, soluble solids content, water activity, firmness, colour and volume. Microwave power and air temperature were the two most important processing parameters that influenced the quality of the dehydrated pineapple, with the parameters most affected by the operating conditions being water content and percentage of charred pieces. Only in the latter was a significant quadratic effect found, all others were approximately linear. There was also a significant interactive effect between microwave power and air temperature affecting the percentage of charred pieces. Model predictions using a quadratic surface for water content and % charred pieces were validated with an additional experiment. Quadratic models were used to indicate optimum drying conditions for various targets.",

Treatment conditions were in the temperature range of 160–320 °C and water flow rates of 2.1, 3.5, and 7.0 mL/min under a pressure of 20 MPa. Approximately 78% of the pectin was contained in the fraction collected at 160 °C at each flow rate. Most of the hemicellulose was separated from cellulose up until the fraction obtained at 200 °C. The proportion of cellulose in the residue obtained after hydrothermal treatment at 200 °C reached about 80%. Moreover, the characteristics of recovered cellulose were expected to exhibit greater crystallinity and lower impurity than that of the raw material based on the results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), attenuated total reflectance Fourier transmission infrared (ATR-FTIR), and thermogravimetric-differential thermal analyses (TG-DTA).",

Drying rate was not affected by drying gases but increased with drying temperatures. Moisture ratios, at any given time during the drying process, were compared among various models, namely, Newton, Page, Modified Page I, Henderson and Pabis, two-term, approximation of diffusion, and Midilli. The effect of drying air temperatures on the coefficients of the best moisture ratio model was determined by single step regression method. The R2 coefficient, root mean square error (RMSE) and chi-square (χ2) were criteria for selecting the best model. The study found that the Midilli model was the best model for describing the drying behavior of Thai Hom Mali paddy in every evaluated drying gas. It should be possible to predict the moisture content of a product with a generalized model that shows the effect of drying air temperature on the model constants and coefficients.",

     "abstract": "The present work is mainly focused on the study of the thin layer drying behaviour of sludge from water treatment plants in tomato processing industries, using a convective dryer. The drying experiments were conducted at inlet temperatures of drying air of 30 °C, 40 °C and 50 °C and at an airflow rate of 0.9 m/s and 1.3 m/s. The drying rate was found to increase with temperature and velocity, hence reducing the total drying time. In particular, as drying temperature was raised from 30 °C up to 50 °C, the time period needed to reduce the moisture content of the sample from 173 wt% down to 7 wt% (dry basis) was observed to decrease from more than 760 min to 470 min (0.9 m/s) and from 715 min to 295 min (1.3 m/s).Using a non-linear regression (Marquart's method) together with a multiple regression analysis, a mathematical model for the thin-layer convective drying process of sludge from treatment plants in tomato processing industries was proposed. The values of the diffusivity coefficients at each temperature were obtained using Fick's second law of diffusion, and varied from 6.11 × 10−10 m2/s to 2.54 × 10−9 m2/s over the temperature and velocity range. The temperature dependence of the effective diffusivity coefficient was described following an Arrhenius-type relationship. The activation energy for the moisture diffusion was determined as 30.15 kJ/mol and 36.70 kJ/mol, for airflow rates of 0.9 m/s and 1.3 m/s respectively.

Dehydration caused a decrease of all grape compounds studied excluding total phenols.

Further increase in frying cycles did not result in any significant changes in these parameters (p > 0.05). Similar trends were observed for these parameters in case of heating. Relative amounts of total saturated fatty acids increased due to marginal decrease in total unsaturated fatty acids content during frying cycles, however, no significant change was observed during heating.

A total of 676 data point was used to develop the neuro-fuzzy model considering the inputs as the fraction of water content, temperature and apparent porosity of food materials. The complexity of the data set which incorporates wide ranges of temperature (including those below freezing points) made it difficult for the data to be predicted by normal analytical and conventional models. However the adaptive neuro-fuzzy model (ANFIS) was able to predict conductivity values which closely matched the experimental values by providing lowest mean square error compared to multivariable regression and conventional artificial neural network (ANN) models. This method also alleviates the problem of determining the hidden structure of the neural network layer by trial and error.",

     "abstract": "This paper describes moisture diffusivity, shrinkage, equilibrium moisture content and finite element simulated drying of coffee. The moisture diffusivities in different components of parchment coffee were determined by minimizing the sum of square of deviations between the predicted and the experimental values of moisture contents during thin layer drying under controlled conditions of drying air temperature and relative humidity. The drying of coffee bean and parchment was conducted in thin layers at a temperature of 40, 50 and 60 °C with relative humidity in the range of 14–25%. The mean diffusivity values of coffee bean and parchment are related to the temperatures and are expressed by Arrhenius-type equations. The moisture diffusivities of parchment are lower than those of the coffee bean. The shrinkage of coffee bean derived from experiments is expressed as a function of moisture reduction. GAB model is sufficient for the prediction for sorption isotherm of parchment coffee and the parameters of the GAB model are a function of temperature and it is expressed by Arrhenius-type equations. Sensory evaluation of the coffee dried at 40, 50 and 60 °C shows that the overall acceptance by coffee cupping test and the concentration of caffeine is within the acceptable limit. A two-dimensional finite element model was developed for simulate moisture diffusion during drying process of parchment coffee. The finite element model was programmed in Compaq Visual FORTRAN version 6.5. The model simulates the moisture contents in different components of parchment coffee well and it provides a better understanding of the transport processes in the different components of the parchment coffee.",

     "abstract": "Instant active dry baker's yeast is a well-known product widely used for leavening of bread, produced by fermentation, and usually dried by hot air to 94–96% dry matter content. Multi-stage fluidized bed drying process is a commercial effective method for yeast drying. In this work, optimum operating parameters of an industrial continuous fluidized bed dryer for the production of instant active dry yeast were investigated. The dryer contained four zones separated with moving weirs. The operating conditions such as temperature, loading rate of compressed yeast granules, and hot air humidity had direct effects on both yeast activity and viability. The most important factors that affected the quality of the product were loading rate and the operational temperature in each zone on the bed. Optimization was performed for three loading rates of the feed to the dryer, using response surface methodology for the experimental design. The most significant factor was shown to be the loading rate with mean fermentation activity values of 620, 652, and 646 cm3 CO2/h for 300, 350, and 400 kg/h loading rates, respectively. The data analysis resulted in an optimal operating point at a loading rate of 350 kg/h and temperatures of zones 1, 2, 3, and 4 controlled at 33, 31, 31, and 29 °C, respectively. The best activity value was predicted as 668 ± 18 cm3 CO2/h, and confirmation experiments resulted in 660 ± 10 cm3 CO2/h. At the same operating point, the average viability of the cells was predicted as 74.8 ± 3.7% and confirmed as 76.4 ± 0.6%.

The treatments in air drying were carried out at 30 °C and 70 °C.From the results it is possible to conclude that the increase in drying temperature reduced drastically the hardness of green peppers and the freeze drying had an intermediate effect between vegetables dried at 30 °C and 70 °C. Moreover, the springiness was higher in dried green peppers but an opposite effect was observed on chewiness. With respect to pumpkin, any dependence between the fiber orientation and the hardness of the fresh vegetable was not found. In addition, increasing temperature from 30 °C to 70 °C particularly reduced the hardness and the chewiness of dried product and maintained cohesiveness and springiness approximately constant.Regarding the color, it was possible to conclude that air drying at 30 °C produced small changes in color of green pepper whereas air drying at 70 °C and freeze drying originated more intense color changes. The increase of temperature on air drying augmented the color saturation of dried pumpkin while decreased the hue angle by a linear relationship. In addition, the chroma of dried pumpkin decreased significantly with the freeze drying, while the hue angle was maintained constant as compared with the fresh vegetable.",

A maximum of 360.3 U/g DCW of lactase was recovered with a release rate constant, Ka, of 0.454/min at an acoustic power of 50 W. The experimental data was fitted to Doulah's equation to determine the kinetic constant β and decipher the pattern of lysis during the ultrasonication process. Here we also hypothesize that due to local heat generation during the ultrasonication process, the enzyme was translocated from the cytoplasmic space in to the periplasm.",

     "abstract": "An efficient and easily scaled up method to isolate superoxide dismutase from garlic is proposed. The separation and purification procedure consists of phosphate buffer extraction, heat treatment and a two-stage ultrafiltration process. The enzyme was purified 139-fold with a specific activity of 2867 U/mg protein and a yield of 91%. The native molecular mass of superoxide dismutase estimated by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Superose 6 column was 28 kDa. Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed a single band near 14 kDa, suggesting that native enzyme was homo-dimeric. The optimal pH for enzyme activity was found to be 7.0, and at this pH the enzyme exhibited maximum activity at 50 °C in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer. Among various metal ions examined, Cu2+ and Zn2+ exerted a positive effect on superoxide dismutase activity, whereas Hg2+ was found to be a strong inhibitor. The final purified enzyme had an isoelectric point of 5.1–5.4 and a sheet content of 46%, consistent with the literature values. This shows that the purified SOD folded with a reasonable secondary structure.",

Three membranes, resistant to organic solvents, have been used: Starmem™ 240 (polyimide), Duramem™ 300 and Duramem™ 500 (both of them modified polyimide). The dependence of the membrane rejection on its MWCO is presented. The separation of flavonoids from phenols with lower molecular weight is found possible at MWCO > 400 Da. A decrease of the flux is observed at permeate to feed volume ratio of about 0.58, thus indicating the existence of a critical concentration, independent of the feed volume and MWCO of the membranes used. The membrane behaviour during nanofiltration has been characterised by ESEM and ATR-FTIR.Concentrations of active compounds up to 3–4 times higher have been obtained in the retentates. The extracts concentrated by nanofiltration preserve their high antioxidant activity. Further dilution of the retentates displays a logarithmic concentration dependence of the radical scavenging activity. The experiments have proved the possibility for permeate use for extraction instead of ethanol, thus essentially reducing the volume of the solvent.",

In this study, kenaf seed oils obtained by Sonication, Soxhlet and supercritical carbon dioxide fluid extraction (SFE) with 9 different combinations of pressure (bars) and temperature (°C) (200/40, 200/60, 200/80, 400/40, 400/60, 400/80, 600/40, 600/60 and 600/80) were investigated for the cytotoxicities. All the oils were cytotoxic towards ovarian cancer (CaOV3) and colon cancer (HT29) cell lines in a dose dependent manner as detected by using the MTT assay and trypan blue dye exclusion method. Oil from Sonication was the most cytotoxic towards CaOV3 cell line. Treated cells exhibited characteristics of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. In conclusion, kenaf seed oils from the three extractions were cytotoxic towards CaOV3 cell line in a dose-dependent manner possibly via the induction of apoptosis. In considering the safety of the product, SFE technology is a better alternative extraction method that is suitable in kenaf seed oil extraction.",

     "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to see the applicability of using brown edible seaweeds as a sole source of nutrition for the growth of lactic acid bacteria. Growth kinetics of lactic acid bacteria (LAB; Lactobacillus plantarum) was studied using three species of edible Irish brown seaweeds Himanthalia elongata, Laminaria digitata and Laminaria saccharina. As part of the screening process, growth of the LAB was carried out on raw and heat treated forms of seaweeds. The seaweed species in their raw state could not support the growth of L. plantarum. Heat treatment resulted in almost 4 times increase in the total sugar content in L. digitata and L. saccharina broth which allowed the growth of L. plantarum for 24 h after which the cell number started decreasing. The Laminaria spp. contains a high content of laminaran polysaccharide which can be fermented by LAB. In case of H. elongata, neither raw nor heat treated forms could be fermented; even though the total sugar content increased 4.6 times upon the application of heat. Kinetics of cell growth, lactic acid and acetic acid production was evaluated at different agitation rates in heat treated seaweeds. A maximum log CFU/ml of 10 was achieved at the end of 16–24 h of fermentation for L. saccharina and L. digitata, respectively. The cell growth increased and lactic acid accumulation decreased as the agitation speed was increased from 0 to 100 rpm. Maximum lactic acid accumulation of 2.5 g/l was achieved under static (0 rpm) conditions. The production of acetic acid was very minimal during the entire course of fermentation. Experimental data was mathematically modelled to optimize the cell growth and lactic acid production with respect to the different rotation conditions. The results of this study present an indication of the potential of fermentation of seaweeds using LAB with a possibility towards the development of a range of functional foods.",

The chemical properties that were analysed in the fresh and dried pumpkin were: moisture content, total and reducing sugars, acidity, proteins, lipids, crude fibre and ash.The results enable concluding that the convective drying at the lowest temperature, 30 °C, induces reductions of 14% in proteins, 65% in total sugars and 36% in fibre. Furthermore, the drying temperature seems to have a negligible effect on the nutritional characteristics of the pumpkin, since the results for the drying at 30 °C are quite similar to those for the drying at 70 °C.With respect to the other subject analysed, the drying kinetics, the results show that the increase on the operating temperature strongly accelerates the drying process, so that the process at 30 °C takes 8 h while at 70 °C the drying is finished after only 2 h.

Effects of temperature (50–85 °C), air velocity (0.6–1.2 m/s) and a pre-treatment (ascorbic acid + sucrose-saturated solution) were investigated. The sorption isotherm and heat of sorption of mirabelle plum were mathematically described respectively by the Guggenheim, Anderson and de Boer (GAB) model and a new one. Depending on temperature and air velocities, the effective diffusivity and the energy of activation were respectively in the range of 8–16.8 × 10−10 m2 s−1 and 43.7–55.14 kJ mol−1. To establish the model best adapted to describe this process the fit quality of five models (Newton, page, modified page, logarithmic and diffusion) were evaluated and compared. The diffusion model led to low values of reduced χ-square, mean square root and mean relative deviation modulus with the highest linear regression coefficient. This model was validated in a large range of operating conditions and represents an excellent tool to predict the duration of this process. The pre-treatment preserves biochemical properties of the dried mirabelle plums (reducing sugar content, total phenolic compounds and anti-oxidant activity).",

These ferulated esters can be widely used as natural antioxidant in both lipid containing food and cosmetic applications. External mass transfer limitations were lowest, when the agitation speed was higher than 180 rpm. A linear relationship between the initial reaction rate and enzyme load up to 10% demonstrated that the internal diffusion limitations could be minimized. The effects of various parameters on yields and rates of reaction were studied in the absence of mass transfer limitations. The initial reaction rate increased when the reaction temperature was raised in the range of 45–65 °C, further increase to 70 °C decreased the final yield to 48.9%. The value of activation energy was calculated as 65.04 kJ/mol based on the Arrhenius law.

Effect of fermentation conditions (temperature, pH, SO2 and aeration) on wine fermentation was evaluated based on yeast growth, duration, fermentation rate and volatile composition. The composition of the major volatile compounds with low boiling points was determined by gas chromatography under the different operating conditions of fermentation temperature (15–35 °C), pH (3.5–6.0), SO2 (100–300 ppm) and aeration (initial dissolved O2 and shaking at 30 rpm). Temperature had important effect on yeast growth and on the levels of volatile compounds. It was observed that the final concentrations of ethyl acetate and some of the higher alcohols decreased when fermentation temperature increased to 25 °C (35 mg/l at 15 °C and 27 mg/l at 25 °C). SO2 stimulated the yeast growth up to certain level and in excess it inhibited the yeast metabolism. Ethanol concentration slightly increased with the addition of 100 ppm SO2 (8.2 g/l) and decreased with increase in concentration of SO2 (6.2 g/l in 300 ppm SO2). Aeration by shaking increased the viable cell count (from 52 × 106 in the absence of oxygen to 98 × 106 in shaking at 30 rpm) but decreased the ethanol productivity (from 7.2 in initial dissolved O2 to 6.5 g/l shaking at 30 rpm).

The cookies became crispier as indicated by the reduction in the breaking strength value from 4.94 to 3.29 kg.

     "abstract": "Arthrospira (Spirulina) platensis Toliara isolated from alkaline and salt lakes in the south-western area of Madagascar is a potential source of proteins that could efficiently fight against food deficiency in developing countries like Madagascar. Up to now, productivity in this country has been low, so a better understanding of the growth conditions of this species is needed to improve its production. Growth experiments were undertaken in bubble columns at laboratory scale. The influence of agitation of the culture, medium salinity (ranging from 13 to 35 g L−1) and CO2 addition (ranging from 0 to 2%, v/v) on growth and protein content was examined. Because Arthrospira cells are fragile, a bubble column without additional mixing gave the best growth. Arthrospira (Spirulina) platensis showed higher specific growth rate (μmax) and protein content for lower salinity. Addition of 1% of CO2 improved the productivity by near 60%. The feasability of semi-continuous culture was demonstrated and optimal culture conditions led to a mean productivity of 0.22 ± 0.03 g L−1 d−1, a mean specific growth rate of 0.015 ± 0.002 h−1 and a protein content of 53 ± 2% of total dry weight.",

     "abstract": "Some researchers suggest that two-thirds of the world's plant species have medicinal value; in particular, many medicinal plants have great antioxidant potential. Antioxidants reduce the oxidative stress in cells and are therefore useful in the treatment of many human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases and inflammatory diseases. This paper reviews the antioxidant potential of extracts from the stems, roots, bark, leaves, fruits and seeds of several important medicinal species. Synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxylanisole (BHA) are currently used as food additives, and many plant species have similar antioxidant potentials as these synthetics. These species include Diospyros abyssinica, Pistacia lentiscus, Geranium sanguineum L., Sargentodoxa cuneata Rehd. Et Wils, Polyalthia cerasoides (Roxb.) Bedd, Crataeva nurvala Buch-Ham., Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn, Teucrium polium L., Dracocephalum moldavica L., Urtica dioica L., Ficus microcarpa L. fil., Bidens pilosa Linn. Radiata, Leea indica, the Lamiaceae species, Uncaria tomentosa (Willd.) DC, Salvia officinalis L., Momordica Charantia L., Rheum ribes L., and Pelargonium endlicherianum.

Protection against oxidative damage to DNA molecules of various parts of flower was confirmed visually by DNA breaking assay. Total phenolic contents of the parts of flower and peel and leaves were estimated by Folin–Ciocalteu method and receptacle was found to contain the highest amount (148.41 ± 6.25 mg/g) of phenolics among the parts of flower, but the phenolic content of flower (petal, stamen and receptacle) was lower than peel, higher than leaves. Linear correlation (R2 = 0.7139–0.9987) between antioxidant potential of various parts in different assays and phenolic contents was observed. This preliminary study indicates the antioxidant activity of PF, and moreover the results showed correlation with the amount of phenolic content present in different parts.

An expanded-surface solar air collector has been used to achieve high heat transfer and turbulence effect whiles a solar air collector with PCM has been used to perform the drying process even after the sunset. On the other hand, the swirl elements have been located to give the swirl effect to air flow in drying room. These advantages make the proposed novel system a promising dryer in that lower moisture value and less drying time. The drying experiments have been carried out simultaneously both under natural conditions and by the dryer with swirl flow and without swirl flow at three different air velocities. The obtained moisture ratio values have been applied to six different moisture ratio models in the literature. The model having the highest correlation coefficient (R) and the lowest Chi-square (χ2) value has been determined as the most relevant one for each seeded grape drying status.",

Drying experiments were carried out at 45, 55 and 65 °C during 32 h. Before osmotic dehydration operation, shell and tegument tissue were carefully removed in all samples. Rough external surface was maintained (peeled samples) or also removed (cut chestnuts) in different tests in order to evaluate the effect of the presence of this layer in the mass transfer rate. A diffusional model involving shrinkage was employed to simulate the drying kinetics of the all studied systems and values of the effective coefficient of diffusion of water were obtained. These coefficients were successfully correlated with temperature by means of an exponential equation and were employed to evaluate the additional mass transfer resistances due to the presence of layers and by the acquisition of osmotic solute in cut and peeled samples. The experimental determination of local salt and moisture contents during drying showed the existence of a drying front for water that moves along from surface to the centre of the sample and that salt accumulates near surface but also achieve the centre during the osmotic dehydration. Additionally, the analyses of the surface colour of air dried samples indicated that osmotic dehydration with salt keeps the characteristics observed for non-treated cut samples and deteriorates the colour quality in the case of peeled samples.",

     "publication date": "04-2011",
     "abstract": "Carrot is one of the important root crops cultivated worldwide. In many cases, carrot must be dried prior to its use. Although hot air drying is one of the most common methods for drying carrots, it is well known that hot air drying leads to much quality degradation of a dried product. To alleviate the adverse effect of hot air drying many pretreatment methods have been proposed. In this study, the effects of pretreatments with citric acid, which is used as an anti-darkening agent and a texture-modifier, were investigated. Carrots were soaked in citric acid to pH of either 4 or 5 or blanched in citric acid to pH of either 4 or 5 prior to hot air drying. Untreated carrots, carrots soaked in water and carrots blanched in water were used as control samples. The effects of pretreatments, in combination with hot air drying at 70, 80 and 90 °C, on selected physicochemical properties of dried carrots, namely, color, shrinkage, rehydration ability, β-carotene content and cis–trans isomerization of β-carotene, were evaluated. It was noted that carrots, which were soaked and blanched in citric acid, were redder than the untreated sample. Although shrinkage of pretreated carrots was higher, the rehydration ability of the pretreated carrots was higher than that of the untreated sample. The β-carotene content of carrots with no pretreatment decreased continuously, whereas the contents of β-carotene in citric acid soaked and blanched carrots tended to be unchanged. However, isomerization of β-carotene in all samples was not significantly different.",

The dependencies indicated the mechanism of water sorption: the equilibrium moisture content is limited by the state of starch gelatinization and the initial rate of water sorption is governed by the water diffusion through the pores of the spaghetti regardless of the starch gelatinization. The empirical equations were proposed to predict the amount of loss of the spaghetti mass during water sorption which results in the quality loss of cooked spaghetti and the moisture content which affects the mechanical properties and an optimal immersion time. The equation of the moisture content, taking the effect of starch gelatinization into consideration, has the initial diameter of spaghetti, immersion time, and temperature of immersed water as parameters to predict under any conditions.",

Four air temperatures (30, 40, 50 and 60 °C) and five microwave powers (180, 360, 540, 720 and 900 W) were studied. Several experiments were conducted to obtain data for sample moisture content versus drying time. The results showed that increasing the drying air temperature resulted in up to 5% decrease in drying time while in the microwave-assisted fluidized bed system, the drying time decreased dramatically up to 50% at a given and corresponding drying air temperature at each microwave energy level. As a result, addition of microwave energy to the fluidized bed drying is recommended to enhance the drying rate of shelled corn. Furthermore, in the present study, the application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting the drying time (output parameter for ANN modeling) was investigated. Microwave power, drying air temperature and grain moisture content were considered as input parameters for the model. An ANN model with 170 neurons was selected for studying the influence of transfer functions and training algorithms. The results revealed that a network with the Tansig (hyperbolic tangent sigmoid) transfer function and trainrp (Resilient back propagation) back propagation algorithm made the most accurate predictions for the shelled corn drying system. The effects of uncertainties in output experimental data and ANN prediction values on root mean square error (RMSE) were studied by introducing small random errors within a range of ±5%.",

Antioxidant properties and phenolic compounds of FIR–HA dried mulberry tea were determined and compared with the commercial product and with fresh leaves. We found that a smaller decrease in L and b values of the FIR–HA dried tea than those of commercial tea was observed. FIR–HA tea was found to have similar colour to fresh leaf while the commercial tea had darker colour. A significant decrease in total phenolic acid content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) was found in hot-air (HA) dried commercial tea compared to fresh leaves, while TPC in FIR–HA dried tea was significantly increased. Similar results were found in 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical activities. However, the results were different for ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Both teas had lower FRAP values compared to fresh leaves. Eleven phenolic compounds were identified in fresh leaf and in mulberry tea, namely p-coumaric acid, benzoic acid, (+)-catechin, chlorogenic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, sinapic acid, protocatechuic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid and caffeic acid. The total content of phenolic compounds (TPCC) increased in FIR–HA dried samples compared to those of HA dried tea, except for chlorogenic and syringic acids, which were found in greater amounts in HA dried commercial tea. Our results have demonstrated that FIR–HA should be considered as a suitable drying method for mulberry tea with respect to preserving its antioxidant properties and phenolic compounds.",

     "abstract": "The effects of alkali emulsion of ethyl oleate and air temperature (60, 70 and 75 °C) on the drying characteristics of sweet cherry were studied using a hot air dryer at a constant air velocity of 2.0 m/s. It was observed that both the alkali emulsion of ethyl oleate and air temperature affected the drying time. The drying times of pre-treated samples were 19.5–22.6% shorter than those of control samples. Five semi-theoretical thin-layer models, namely, Lewis, Henderson and Pabis, Logarithmic, Page, Wang and Singh models were used for the modeling of the drying kinetics. The fit quality obtained with each model was evaluated using statistical tests. After comparing experimentally obtained values with the calculated values from the models, it was concluded that Page model represents the drying characteristics better than the other models. The effective moisture diffusivity was determined by using Fick's second law and was observed to lie between 5.683 × 10−10 and 1.544 × 10−9 m2/s for the pre-treated and control samples. Rehydration ratio was significantly affected by pre-treatment and air temperature. It was found to increase proportionally with the increase in air drying temperature.",

     "abstract": "The process of drying of the leaves of Inga edulis, a flavonoid-rich plant from Amazonia, was optimised in a forced convection dryer by combining experimental design and mathematical modelling. First, the monolayer moisture content was determined by hygroscopic studies at 25 °C and the value of this parameter (5.86 g/100 g dry matter) was fixed as a minimum to be achieved. Next, a 32 full-factorial design was applied, with temperature (40, 55 and 70 °C) and airflow velocity (0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 m/s) as the independent variables, the dependent variable being the drying time required to reduce the moisture content until the level determined in the monolayer was achieved. Nine kinetic models, with one to four parameters, were fitted to the experimental data. The fitting performance of these models was assessed using statistical criteria and, from these results, the Henderson and Pabis model was found to be sufficient to predict the monolayer drying times. Subsequently, a multiple linear regression was carried out by applying a second-order model to describe the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, which established the adequacy of this model (R2 > 0.97) and, thus, the applicability of the combined statistical and mathematical approaches. Finally, an experimental domain that could minimise the drying times (time < 40 min) was determined. An experimental validation of the model was accomplished in a point of this domain and good agreement was found between the experimental and predicted values. Moreover, no flavonol degradation was observed, whereas a loss of 19.4% for the total flavanols was found.",

     "abstract": "Methods used to evaluate the effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection regimes, or of putative antimicrobial surfaces, rely on an estimate of the amount of viable microbial cells remaining on a surface after treatment. In essence, microbial cells are applied to the surface, and the number remaining after a specified time/treatment is assessed by variety of methods. This paper provides a critical commentary on these methods.The most common method relies on removal of the cells from the surface, by swabbing or agitation, plating onto culture media, and counting the number of colonies obtained. However, the surface should always be subsequently examined for residual cells: low numbers of colonies are deemed indicative of effective cleaning (i.e. few cells on the surface), but they could also indicate that cells have not been removed from the surface. Swabbing efficiency can be affected by moisture at the surface, presence of organic material, surface topography and presence of antimicrobial compounds.It is important to be aware of the limitations of a given method for assessing the presence of microorganisms on a surface, as well as of the intended antimicrobial property of the surface or agent applied to the surface.",

In biofouling the ‘Baier curve’ is a well-known result which relates adhesion to surface energy, and papers on the effect of changing surface energy to food fouling can be found more than 40 years ago. Recently the use of modified surfaces, at least at a research level, has been widespread. Here two different ways of studying surface–deposit interactions have been compared. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a method for probing interactions at a molecular level, and can measure (for example) the interaction between substrate and surfaces at a nm-scale. At a μm–mm level, we have developed a micromanipulation tool that can measure the force required to remove the deposit; the measure incorporates both surface and bulk deformation effects. The two methods have been compared by studying a range of model soils: toothpaste, as an example of a soil that can be removed by fluid flow alone, and confectionery soils. Removal has been studied from glass, stainless steel and fluorinated surfaces as examples of the sort of surfaces that can be found in practice. AFM measurements were made by using functionalized tips in force mode. The two types of probe give similar results, although the rheology of the soil affects the measurement from the micromanipulation probe under some circumstances. The data suggests that either method could be used to test candidate surfaces.",

A number of coatings and surface treatments were tested. Certain polyurethane-coated plates and tubes formed thinner deposit layer compared to standard uncoated stainless steel plates and tubes. The cleaning time for one coated tube was reduced by 80% compared to the standard stainless steel one. A pilot plant including a milk pasteurizer at LUFA Nord-West in Oldenburg-Germany was used for the thermal treatment of whey protein solutions. Plates coated with different nano-composites as well as electropolished plates were installed in the heating section of the pasteurizer. Significant differences were observed between coated and uncoated plates. The coated plates showed reduced deposit buildup in comparison with the uncoated stainless steel plates. Polyurethane-coated plates exhibited the thinnest deposit layer. Electro-polished plates also reduced deposit buildup in comparison to the standard stainless steel plates and were almost comparable to the coated plates.

An unusual behaviour (discontinuity) is reported during swelling in the commercial formulation. It is proposed that hydration of the deposit and an extent of swelling (ratio of the final to the initial deposit thickness) of ∼12 is necessary before the enzymes can promote deposit removal.",

Investigation of the cleaning of beer fermenter deposits revealed two types of fouling; yeast foam (type A) and yeast film (type B). Rheological characterisation indicated both deposits could be mimicked in lab scale fouling experiments using yeast slurry aged for different times. Water and chemical rinsing of these deposits on a lab scale flow cell revealed three distinct cleaning phases: (i) hydration and swelling, (ii) removal in the flow by dissolution and in patches and (iii) no further removal. At 30 and 50 °C water rinsing at the flow velocities investigated could remove up to 85% of the deposit. At a water rinsing temperature of 70 °C, less deposit could be removed overall. Rheological studies indicated that increasing the temperature of the deposit generated a more elastic deposit which may decrease cleanability. Chemical cleaning using 2 wt% Advantis 210 (a NaOH base cleaning agent) eventually gave a visually clean surface at all flow velocities and temperatures. Chemical cleaning at 70 °C gave the shortest cleaning times for all flow velocities, but comparable cleaning times were observed when rinsing at 30 and 50 °C, suggesting that an increase in temperature from 30 to 50 °C might not decrease the cleaning time.",

The thickness-time profiles for βLg gels exhibited Fickian behaviour, whilst the whey protein-based systems showed linear swelling behaviour. The pH values at which the latter gels started to swell were significantly higher than those observed for βLg, while they all showed a pH/volume fraction threshold for dissolution. These differences in swelling and dissolution behaviour are related to the structure of the gels, i.e. fine stranded vs. particulate, and suggest that the key step in the alkaline dissolution of industrial dairy foulants is the conversion of particulate gels to the fine-stranded form.",

A time-independent and isotropic approach to model the wall shear stress is introduced. The optical monitoring procedure uses a model food soil consisting of starch as matrix material and phosphorescent zinc sulfide crystals as optical tracer. Investigations of pulsed flow cleaning published prior to this work focused on tests with straight pipes, whereas difficulties in industrial cleaning operations more often arise while operating piping systems and plant components with complex geometries.

In dead-end filtration, the deposition of ballotini on a polymeric membrane is monitored quantitatively via measurements of thickness and the permeate flux.

Used in right quantity, hypochlorite well finishes the cleaning and can also be used alone as a cleaner [removing 95% of the proteinaceous fouling]. However, if the amount of hypochlorite is not sufficient to end the cleaning, this can lead to large reductions production flux [a 13% decrease on skim milk flux was observed]. Other oxidants such as PVP-iodine, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid and sodium perborate do not achieve hydraulic cleanliness [90% of flux recovery]. Oxidants based on hydrogen peroxide and PVP-iodine, when used on a membrane which was still fouled by protein, yielded flux recovery worse than for a single rinsing.",

Later, the output responses for perturbations were investigated with control systems. The application of feedback PID control showed satisfactory results, returning expected output moisture.

Nine different thin layer mathematical drying models were compared according to their correlation coefficient, reduced chi-square and root mean square error to estimate vacuum heat pump drying curves. The result indicates that the Midilli model can present better predictions than the others.

The experimental data was fitted to different empirical kinetic models from the literature, and this kinetic study was then complemented with the modelling if terms of Fick's diffusion equation, for estimation of the diffusion coefficients. On the other hand, the chemical characterization in fresh and dried onions at different temperatures (varying from 30 °C to 70 °C) was analysed, to evaluate the effect of drying and drying temperature on the chemical composition of the product. In this way, the analyses of moisture content, sugar content, crude protein, ash, fat, crude fibre, acidity and vitamin C were made and reported in this paper.From the results obtained it was verified that some chemical components of the onions are not affected by drying (ash, fat, protein and fibre) whereas some others are considerably influenced by drying (sugars, acidity and vitamin C). The present work allowed concluding that the three empirical models tested (Newton, Modified Page and Logarithmic) all describe relatively well the dehydration kinetics at the three temperatures analysed.

Fried meat had lower saturated fatty acid content due to the incorporation of mono-unsaturated (C18:1) fatty acids from oil. The incorporation of oil fatty acids caused a decrease in conjugated linoleic acid relative content. Moreover, fried meat showed the highest levels of the unhealthy trans fatty acids. Therefore, frying was shown as the worst cooking methods regarding human health. Boiling and grilling increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, while frying had no effect on them.",

The stability of biochemical compounds was evaluated by using mass balance analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy. The results show that the encapsulation efficiency was mainly affected by alginate M/G ratio and bead water content. In general, ca-alginate beads made of higher alginate M/G ratio or dried to a lower water content were found to absorb significantly more aqueous extract. However, the beads made of higher M/G ratio were less rigid after the absorption process. Besides, the mass balance analysis reveals that the encapsulation process and material did not degrade the bioactive compounds, as the total antioxidant content remained unchanged. This is well supported by the FT-IR analysis where the characteristic bands of chemical groups remained unaltered.

     "abstract": "Essential oil of Nepeta persica cultivated in Iran was obtained by steam distillation and supercritical (carbon dioxide) extraction methods. The oils were analysed by capillary gas chromatography using flame ionization and mass spectrometric detections. The compounds were identified according to their retention indices and mass spectra (EI, 70 eV). The effects of different parameters such as pressure, temperature, modifier volume and extraction times (dynamic and static) on the supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of N. persica oil were investigated. The results showed that under the pressure of 20.3 MPa, temperature of 45 °C, methanol of 1.5% v/v), dynamic extraction time of 50 min and static extraction time of 25 min extraction was more selective for the 4αβ,7α,7aα-nepetalactone. Twelve compounds were identified in the steam-distilled oil. The major components of N. persica were 4αβ,7α,7aα-nepetalactone (26.5%), cis-β-farnesene (4.4%) and 3,4α-dihydro-4aα,7α,7aα-nepetalactone (3.5%). However, by using supercritical carbon dioxide under optimum conditions, only two components have more than 90.0% of the oil. The extraction yield based on steam distillation was 0.08% (v/w). On the other hand, using SFE extraction yield in the range of 0.22–8.90% (w/w) were obtained at different conditions. The results show that, in Iranian N. persica oil, 4αβ,7α,7aα-nepetalactone is a major component.",

     "abstract": "Industrial juice clarification is accomplished by a combination of enzymatic depectinization, gelatin–silica sol, and/or bentonite treatment. The gelatin–silica sol treatment step is particularly slow, mischievous, and requires comprehensive downstream processing to obtain clarified juice. In this work, alternative, enzymatic clarification strategies of industrially pressed cherry juice were evaluated in a 24−1 factorial design set-up with addition of a pectinase, Pectinex Smash®, a protease, Enzeco, both enzyme preparations derived from Aspergillus spp., gallic acid, and tannic acid as factors, and determination of turbidity, protein, pectin, and phenolics as responses. The effects of the alternative clarification treatments were assessed immediately after the particular clarification treatment (immediate turbidity) and during 14 days of cold storage (turbidity development). The protease treatment resulted in significant reduction of immediate turbidity, but had low clarification impact during the subsequent cold storage. In contrast, pectinase addition exerted a weak effect on immediate turbidity reduction, but effectively decreased the turbidity development during storage. The phenolic acid additions contributed to reduce turbidity when added together with the pectinase or the protease. However, when gallic acid and tannic acid were added together they induced enhanced turbidity formation. Conventionally, immediate turbidity is presumed to be caused by pectin, while turbidity development during cold storage (haze formation) is assumed to be due to protein–phenol interactions. Our results suggest that proteins play a decisive role in the formation of immediate turbidity in cherry juice, and point to that pectin may contribute to turbidity development during cold storage of cherry juice. The data may thus pave the way for development of improved, alternative procedures for cherry juice clarification.",

This suggested that fragments of glucuronic acid-containing heteroxylans, notably glucuronoarabinoxylans (GAXs), accompanied pectins extraction. A step-wise purification process was therefore developed to efficaciously remove, from pectin extracts, GAX contaminants including non-pectin-incorporated neutral sugar (NS) components. It primarily consisted in treating dialysed pectin extracts or not with 78–85% acidified methanol, which led to the precipitation of pectin-rich fractions while the bulk of GAX and free NS materials were solubilised in the aqueous acid–methanol mixture. Subsequently, advantage was taken of the multivalent ion-binding selectivity and ‘exclusivity’ of the pectin polymer anionic (carboxyl) groups to produce GAX and NS oligosaccharide contaminants-free final isolates, and hence greatly enriched in pectin components.",

Various carbon sources and refined natural vegetable oils as co-substrates were used. The different carbon sources greatly affect the final composition of carotenoids, with lactose medium to preferentially accumulate the all-trans-β-carotene. Furthermore, the use of lactose and starch as carbon sources, respectively, gives a first indication that B. trispora is able to metabolise various homo- and hetero-saccharides, thus leading to different carotenoid percentages. The presence of oils as co-substrates resulted in enhanced fungus growth and subsequent higher carotenoid production. Substrates containing linoleic acid or other oils rich in it led to less lycopene accumulation. The data showed that the biosynthesis of lycopene, γ-carotene and β-carotene starts in most cases simultaneously in the early growth phase even in trace amounts and thus may play a role also as antioxidants for the B. trispora cells.",

     "abstract": "There is an increasing trend towards reducing the use of organic solvents in industry due to environmental constraints and the adoption of green chemistry guidelines. To overcome the low volumetric productivity of aqueous bioconversion systems involving sparingly water soluble hydrophobic compounds, processes are being developed and designed to incorporate green solvent such as supercritical fluids, ionic liquids and natural oils, and liquid polymers, among others as an alternative to organic solvents. Moreover, processes are developed and redesigned to use/reuse chemicals and reagents derived from waste or renewable feed stocks in order to diminish E-factors.In this work, the use of green solvents as key components in the bioconversion media for a multi-step microbial bioconversion was assessed in a suspended whole cell system, combined with the use of by-products as raw materials, ultimately used as carbon source for cell growth and as sterol substrate for bioconversion. The model system is the selective cleavage of the side-chain of β-sitosterol performed by free resting cells of Mycobacterium sp. NRRL B-3805, a well-established industrial multi-enzymatic process involving the use of nine catabolic enzymes in a 14-step metabolic pathway.Bioconversion yields in silicone media were higher than the ones obtained in polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG) and ionic liquids, as well as in dioctyl phthalate (DOP), an organic solvent that has previously been shown to allow high conversion yields. Total conversion of 12 mM substrate in silicone media was consistently obtained at the end of 120-h bioconversion runs. Similar bioconversion profiles were attained during a 50-fold scale-up, maintaining constant the power consumption per unit of volume.",

     "abstract": "The extraction and back-extraction of bovine serum albumin (BSA) have been studied by liquid–liquid extraction with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)/potassium citrate aqueous two-phase system (ATPS). In this work, the ATPS was examined with regard to the effects of PEG molecular weight (PEG 1000, 2000, 4000 and 6000), PEG and potassium citrate concentration, BSA concentration (CBSA) and pH on BSA partition. The pH was found to have significant effects on BSA partition with low molecular weight PEG 1000. The yield of the BSA, 99%, was obtained in the top phase under the following conditions: 19% (w/w) PEG 1000, 20% (w/w) potassium citrate and 0.75 mg/g CBSA at pH 7.0 and 30 °C. BSA can be re-extracted to a new citrate phase by decreasing the pH of the system with a 92% yield. The back-extraction not only separates the BSA from the polymer, but also allows the polymer to be recycled. The global yield (Ye + Ybe) is up to 91%.",

     "abstract": "Native granular starches (corn, cassava, mung bean, and sago) were hydrolyzed using a mixture of alpha-amylase and glucoamylase at 35 °C for 24 h. Hydrolyzed starches were analyzed for the degree of hydrolysis and for physicochemical and functional properties. Corn starch showed the highest degree of hydrolysis, as evidenced by the presence of distinct pores penetrating deep into the granules. Enzymatic erosion occurred mainly at the surface for cassava, whereas isolated porous structures were observed in hydrolyzed mung bean and sago starch. The amylose content was significantly lower in all starches except for sago starch. The powder X-ray diffraction of all starches showed no significant changes after hydrolysis, but hydrolyzed starches showed a more crystalline nature. The action of enzymes caused significant changes in some pasting properties and in the swelling/solubility of starches. Evidently, enzymes were able to hydrolyze granular starches to a variable degree at sub-gelatinization temperature, and produced a relatively high degree of conversion.",

     "abstract": "Non-structured kinetic models are proposed for the mathematical description of principal kinetics involved in ethanol production during kefir fermentation in a batch reactor system. Experimental data collected from a series of batch fermentations, which were performed at constant temperature (ϑ = 21 °C) and initial kefir grains mass concentration (γKG,0 = 42 g L−1) over different fermentation periods in the interval from (0–89) h, were used to estimate parameters and also to validate the proposed models. The optimal values of the kinetic parameters were approximated by minimizing the discrepancy between the model predictions and corresponding experimental data. The growth of kefir grains could be expressed by a logistic function model, which describes the growth as a function of initial kefir grains concentration, time, specific growth rate, and final kefir grains concentration. The modified Gompertz model, which gives the lag time, the specific production rate and the maximum ethanol mass concentration, was able to describe the formation of ethanol as the fermentation proceeded. In both cases, the model simulation matches well with the experimental observations, which made it possible to elucidate the fermentation characteristics of kefir grains during efficient ethanol production. These models thus can be employed for the development and optimization of bio-based ethanol production processes.",

     "abstract": "In the present study, the effect of culture conditions on cellulase activities by Trichoderma reesei QM9414 grown on rice bran media in solid-state fermentation was evaluated. Also, the optimum conditions were determined using response surface methodology (RSM). A face center design was used to investigate the effect of independent variables i.e. particle size, aeration rate and harvesting time on filter paper activity (FPA), Avicelase and carboxy methyl cellulase (CMCase) activities. The highest FPA, Avicelase and CMCase activities were 11.648, 99.756 and 94.210 U/g dry weight of substrate (DWS), respectively. The results showed that aeration rate and particle size had significant effects on the activity of cellulase on FPA. Also, particle size and harvesting time had significant effects on the activity of both Avicelase and CMCase. The reduction of particle size and harvesting time to 1–1.5 mm and 4 days, respectively increased cellulase activities.",

     "abstract": "In the first stage of experiments, a two-level fractional factorial design was used for screening of the most important factors among concentration of ammonium sulfate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate and date pomace, pH, total spore amount, aeration rate and fermentation time for the production of endopectinase from date pomace by Aspergillus niger PC5. Based on the results of first stage, ammonium sulfate (0.25–0.45%), pH (4.82–6.12) and fermentation time (50–90 h) were selected to be studied further. In the second stage, response surface methodology was used to determine the optimum fermentation conditions for production of the enzyme. Second stage results showed that, fermentation time was the most significant factor on endopectinase activity. After modeling of the fermentation process, maximum amounts of endopectinase (10.88 U ml−1) predicted to be in the following fermentation conditions: pH of medium 5, ammonium sulfate concentration of 0.3% and fermentation time of 76.05 h.",
