     "abstract": "The influence of gelatin from bovine skin on the rheological properties of hydrogels in an extract from the alginate-containing algae Fucus vesiculosus was studied. The shear rate and dynamic mechanical analyses were used to determine the rheological properties. FT-IR spectroscopy showed that the main structural component of the Fucus extract was sodium alginate. The changes of the rheological properties of the extract with the introduction of gelatin are explained using the framework of the alginate–gelatin complexation model. The Fucus extract showed a weakly expressed non-Newtonian behaviour since the flow index in the Ostwald–De Waele equation is 0.91–0.94. The introduction of gelatin (1.0 wt.%) into the extract at 24 °C led to the formation of a hydrogel, whereas the extract itself cannot form a gel with these conditions. Further increasing the concentration of gelatin led to an exponential increase in the yield stress, plastic viscosity and apparent viscosity of the hydrogels. The introduction of gelatin into the Fucus extract at 4 °C led to a non-additive increase in the elastic modulus (G′), and a decrease in the tan δ of the hydrogels, i.e., strengthening of the elastic properties and weakening of viscous properties in these systems. The changes in the rheological parameters of a Fucus extract after the introduction of gelatin can be explained by an increase in the concentration of triple helices in the macromolecular chains of the gelatin, which are the elastic elements in the 3D mixed gel network.",

     "abstract": "The effect of drying methods were evaluated including hot air drying (HD), blanching-hot air drying (BHD), shade drying, microwave-hot air drying (MHD), freeze drying (FD), and vacuum-hot air drying (VHD) on the quality and bioactivities of chrysanthemum flowers. HD had the lowest total flavonoid values due to the reaction between flavonoids and oxidase during drying. Reduced activities of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase in samples from MHD and BHD suggested that they are effective at inhibiting enzymatic browning, while the BHD could lead to the loss of some water-soluble components. Microwave treatment for 30 s combined with 75 °C hot air drying was the most effective treatment in preserving biologically active compounds, resulting in higher antioxidant capacity and greater inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). FT-IR showed that the BHD, microwave treatment for 90 s, and VHD led to loss of more compounds than FD. This study also found that 3,5-di-caffeoylquinic acid (3,5-DCQA), luteolin-7-O-glucoside (LuG), luteolin, and kaempferol were the key bioactive substances inhibiting AChE. Furthermore, molecular docking studies showed that a high inhibition of AChE by 3,5-DCQA and LuG could be attributed to the formation of strong hydrogen bonds. The study may be beneficial for understanding C. morifolium's nutritional value and the effects of drying methods on the quality of the final product.",

Fortification is the common practice followed to overcome such micronutrient deficiencies. Vitamin D is fat soluble in nature and simultaneously sensitive to light and heat, however binding to milk protein improves the solubility and stability towards heat and light. Sodium caseinate, succinylated sodium caseinate (SNaCas), reassembled sodium caseinate (RNaCas) and reassembled succinylated sodium caseinate (RSNaCas) were complexed with ergocalciferol (vitamin D2). Milk protein-vitamin D2 complexes (NaCas-VD, SNaCas-VD, RNaCas-VD and RSNaCas-VD) and free vitamin D2 (free-VD) showed highest stability when stored at −20 °C, followed by 4 °C and 37 °C. At the end of storage period of 48 h, the stability (%) of vitamin D2 in milk protein-vitamin D2 complex and free vitamin D2 (free-VD) fortified milk was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in fortified samples stored in transparent glass bottles (upto 53.88%) as compared to samples stored in low density polyethylene (LDPE) pouches (upto 49.56%) upon exposure to different light intensities (1485, 2970, 4455 lux). Complexation of vitamin D2 with milk protein provided greater stability to withstand the heat treatments (pasteurization, boiling and sterilization). Stability of vitamin D was greater from milk protein-vitamin D2 fortified milk stored in transparent glass bottles than the fortified milk stored in LDPE pouches.",

     "abstract": "Mannitol is a widely used reduced-calorie sweetener with limited studies on its anti-hyperglycemic potential. The anti-hyperglycemic potential of mannitol was investigated using different experimental models. Mannitol inhibited α-glucosidase (IC50 = 180 ± 20% w/v) and α-amylase (IC50 = 75 ± 20% w/v) activities in a dose dependent (2.5–20% w/v) manner, in vitro, although the effective doses are not gastrointestinally tolerable. Mannitol inhibited glucose absorption (IC50 = 19 ± 3% w/v) in isolated rat jejunum in a dose dependent (2.5–20% w/v) manner, perhaps by entrapment of glucose molecules. Acute administration of 0.3 g/kg bw reduced small intestinal glucose absorption in type 2 diabetic rats, which was accompanied by reduced blood glucose. The reduced intestinal glucose absorption may be influenced by the concomitant delayed gastric emptying observed in the mannitol-treated diabetic animals. On the other hand, mannitol increased glucose uptake in a yeast cell suspension (GU50 = 4.7 ± 1.2% w/v), 3T3-L1 adipocytes (GU50 = 1.2 ± 0.4% w/v) and isolated rat muscle (GU50 = 25 ± 3% w/v) in a dose dependent manner. In silico docking suggested that GLUT-4 (binding energy = −15.5 kcal/mol) is a possible molecular target of mannitol. Data from this study suggest that mannitol may be used as a dietary supplement in controlling postprandial blood glucose increase by reducing intestinal glucose absorption and increasing muscle glucose uptake, which needs further study.",

In most enset growing regions of Ethiopia, traditional starters are prepared in local households and added to the scraped enset mash to aid the fermentation. The preparation of the starters differs among ethnic groups. The aim of this study was twofold. The first objective was to obtain an overview of the preparation methods and the specific usage of the starters. To this end, a survey was conducted in eighteen districts (covering seven zones or ethnic groups) in southern Ethiopia. The second objective was to collect starter samples from these districts and characterize their microbial community based on sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The survey results showed that the main ingredients used to prepare the starters were generally the same within a zone but varied between zones. The collected starters had a pH ranging from 3.68 ± 0.16 to 5.62 ± 0.33. Plate counts showed that lactic acid bacteria were present in high numbers in samples collected from Amaro (9.07 ± 0.00 log cfu/g), Tocha (8.70 ± 0.50 log cfu/g) and Mareka (8.86 ± 0.60 log cfu/g) districts.

Overall, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus and Leuconostoc were the dominant LAB genera identified in the starters. These isolates will be further considered for the development of a commercial enset starter culture.",

     "abstract": "Pasteurization, homogenization and storage are essential steps in the processing of commercial milk. However, their effects on thermal and structural properties of milk fat globules (MFG) remain poorly understood. MFG were extracted from raw bovine milk (RM), pasteurized milk (PM), and homogenized-pasteurized milk (HPM) that were stored at 4 °C for 24, 48 and 72 h. Crystallization and melting properties of the MFG were studied using differential scanning calorimetry, and the size distributions were analyzed using laser light scattering. Structural characteristics were observed using confocal laser scanning method and polarized light microscopy, and characterization of crystal polymorphism was done using X-ray diffraction (XRD). Briefly, the bovine milk fat contained about 65% saturated fatty acids. The fat globules from fresh RM and PM had a significantly higher mean diameter than the fresh HPM (2.9, 3.0 and 2.1 µm, respectively). Notably, the crystallization and melting temperatures of the PM fat globules increased by about 4 °C after 72 h storage. Furthermore, the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) of PM was pierced by fat crystals after 48 h storage. With HPM, the integrity of the membrane was more easily maintained due to finer crystals and thicker MFGM after high pressure treatment. XRD patterns showed a transformation trend of α → β' → β polymorphs in MFG from both processed milks. Thermal and morphology properties of MFG were altered during low temperature storage as a result of the formation of more thermodynamically stable and larger-sized β crystals.",

     "abstract": "Tea consumption reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, but how (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin in tea, mediates glucose transporter (GLUT)-containing vesicles in muscle cells is still unknown. This study investigated the hypothesis that EGCG can stimulate glucose transport by regulating endosome-specific signaling control systems, thus enhancing glucose uptake by skeletal muscle cells. To understand the relationship between the endosomal system and the EGCG-regulated pathway in skeletal muscle, the insulin-resistance L6 myotubes, induced by palmitate treatment, were treated with vesicle ablation, actin filament disruption and signaling inhibition and results were analyzed. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated human transferrin was localized to endosomes in the cells, followed by incubation with diaminobenzidine/H2O2. The unablated cell-associated glucose uptake was determined using quantitative fluorescence assay. Ablation of endosomal compartments showed that insulin had little effect on the endosomal recycling pathway, and it mainly affected GLUT4 storage vesicles. Conversely, EGCG stimulated endosomal compartments to facilitate glucose transport using a mechanism independent of the actin-based cytoskeletal transit system. Both Akt and atypical protein kinase C, the downstream effectors of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), participated in the development of palmitate-induced muscle cells insulin resistance. However, EGCG-stimulated glucose uptake is mediated using a PI3K-independent mechanism that involves silent information regulator 1. Thus, glucose transport is regulated by at least two signal cascades and by two types of vesicles, and EGCG can improve glucose uptake in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle through the non-insulin-responsive endosomal pathway.",

To highlight the effect, the freeze-drying (recognized for its high-quality products) and hot air dying (the most commonly used) were also evaluated to compare the drying based on the drying characteristics, sensory qualities, volatile compounds and antioxidant activities of dried products. Results indicated that MPFFD helped to lower the rehydration time and shrinkage of dried samples. Furthermore, the rehydration ratio, color attributes, crispness, volatile compounds and antioxidant activities of dried samples were also conserved as compared to those obtained using hot air drying. Not only were the effects of MPFFD on the quality of C. militaris similar to those of freeze-dried samples, but the drying time of MPFFD was reduced by 71.9% when compared to freeze-drying. Therefore, MPFFD provides a potential method for achieving high-quality dried C. militaris with a faster drying time.",

Live fish were either directly or after 4 h of crowding exposed to air for 0, 15 or 30 min prior to or after killing by a blow to the head and bleeding. Blood clotting time, pH, lactate, glucose, and muscle pH were measured. Also, concentrations of haemoglobin in the muscles were measured using Vis/NIR hyperspectral imaging to indicate residual blood. Stress from crowding and air exposure before and after slaughter resulted in increased concentration of haemoglobin in the fillets, with a faster increase in fish crowded and slaughtered after air exposure. Blood clotting time was shorter after 15 min of air exposure, and decreased further with crowding. Blood and muscle pH, and lactate levels were mainly affected by air exposure time. Overall, air exposure had a negative effect on fillet quality, and this effect was strongest and fastest if fish were crowded prior to the air exposure. However, by slaughtering the fish before air exposure, quality can be improved as this delays the increase in the amount of residual blood.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the gastro-protective effects of β-glucan-enriched FBB extracts in an experimental mouse model of the EtOH-induced gastric ulcer. The gastro-protective activity of FBB was determined using histopathological inspection, level of EtOH absorption from the gastrointestinal-tract and measurement of pro-inflammatory cytokine. Pretreatment of FBB showed less gastrointestinal bleeding and reduced EtOH absorption into the bloodstream with the gastric mucosa. Furthermore, FBB effectively reduced the EtOH-induced mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor α in the gastric mucosa and its level in the blood. These results showed that FBB can prevent gastric mucosal damage induced by acute EtOH-administration in mice by reducing absorption of EtOH by gastric mucosa along with decreasing the inflammatory response. Altogether, this data provides useful information on how β-glucan-enriched food modulates the EtOH-induced gastric mucosal damage, and thus, it could lead to the development of formulations for protecting gastric mucosal injury with acute alcohol intake.",

Native and microwaved Bambara groundnut showed the A-type crystallinity pattern. However, there was a decrease in the relative crystallinity of the starch after microwaving. Microscopically, the native starch granules were smooth but had pinholes after microwaving. Microwaving resulted in significant (p ≤ 0.05) reduction in peak viscosity, hot paste viscosity, cold paste viscosity, pasting temperature and set back ratio. The swelling power of Bambara groundnut starch similarly decreased with increasing microwaving time. Microwave heating led to a shift in the gelatinization range to higher temperatures. However, the enthalpy of gelatinization decreased after microwaving. Short microwaving times (≤60 s) were sufficient to cause significant improvement in the pasting and thermal properties of Bambara groundnut starch. Microwaved Bambara groundnut starch with reduced swelling can be potentially used in food products that do not require high swelling such as noodles.",

The linalool nanoemulsions showed twofold enhanced antibacterial activity against Salmonella Typhimurium through their increased ability to disrupt cell membrane integrity. Moreover, compared to the pure linalool, the linalool nanoemulsions showed an 11.5% higher antibiofilm activity. Nanoemulsions also effectively reduced the S.

Microbial transglutaminase (mTGase) presumably preferentially cross-links molecules that are located within the same particles, meaning that polymer size is limited to the number of monomers initially present in the particles. The aim of this study was to affect the self-association of casein by varying the temperature and thereby controlling the maximum size of casein polymers formed using mTGase. Activity and stability of mTGase were determined at different temperatures, showing that about 10 times more enzyme had to be added at 10 than at 40 °C to compensate for differences in enzyme activity. Analysis with gel electrophoresis showed that incubation temperature had no effect on maximum polymer size at the selected protein concentration (27 g/kg), resulting in similar stiffness of acid-induced gels after incubation for 24 h. For a more detailed characterization of casein polymers, size exclusion chromatography was coupled to multi-angle light scattering (MALS). Estimated molar mass distributions of casein polymers were similar at both incubation temperatures and the increase in molar mass leveled off after moderate incubation time. This underlines the idea of a maximum polymer size and suggests no cross-linking between existing polymers. Besides that, the MALS detector showed a contaminant of low concentration but large size which co-eluted with casein polymers and possibly led to overestimation of their molar masses.",

Most of the hydrolysates were mainly composed of short peptides. A response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the conditions of hydrolysis (pH 7, 8 or 9, and temperatures of 35, 45 or 55 °C), which led to a higher degree of hydrolysis (DH = 3.4%), as well as to an increase in ACE and PEP-inhibitory activities (maximal inhibitions of 68.1 and 81.7%, respectively). According to the model used, neither hydrolysis temperature nor pH in the ranges studied had a significant effect on DH, whereas PEP-inhibitory activity was significantly affected by both factors. pH had a significant effect on ACE-inhibitory activity. Optimum conditions of hydrolysis to obtain maximum activity differed for the two activities: 35 °C/pH 7 for PEP-inhibitory activity and 45.9 °C/pH 9 for ACE-inhibitory activity. The results suggested that these biological activities were influenced by peptide sequence rather than peptide length. This was also confirmed by the amino acid composition and molecular weight (MW) profiles. The ACE-inhibitory activity of the most potent hydrolysate was evaluated after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. The results showed a worsening of the activity, which was related to small peptide losses and to the appearance of new low MW peptides. Hydrolysate encapsulation using an alginate-whey protein isolate microsphere improved the ACE-inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.24 mg/ml).",

The obtained results showed that both methods were effective in terms of extraction of soluble dry matter with significant qualitative and quantitative differences. The alkaline extraction was significantly more effective in terms of the total extracted dry matter and protein content in the extracted material with mean values of 39.97 ± 0.23% and 43.35% ± 2.90, respectively.

Seven CPP with the conserved sequence SpSpSpEE were identified from simulated gastrointestinal hydrolysates. Only 2 of the 6 CPP with the conserved sequence SpSpSpEE in undigested milk survived in the simulated gastric digestion, and all of them were digested by pancreatin during simulated pancreatic digestion.

Anti-oxidants can be used as anti-inflammatory mediators to avoid the progression of many lifestyle associated diseases. The overlapping antioxidative and anti-inflammatory potentials of a buffalo casein-derived hexapeptide (YFYPQL) were studied with in vitro and ex vivo assays. An in vitro Caco-2 cell model suggested that pre-treatment with the hexapeptide showed protection against H2O2 induced oxidative cell death and inhibited (p ≤ 0.01) ROS generation. Peptide treatment also reduced (p ≤ 0.01) the levels of cellular oxidative products of lipids and proteins (MDA and protein carbonyls) and elevated (p ≤ 0.05) the activities of the anti-oxidative enzymes (CAT, SOD and GPX) by stimulating the nuclear response factor-2 (Nrf-2) stress signalling pathway. Moreover, peptide treatment reduced (p ≤ 0.01) the Nrf-2 mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells even in the presence of H2O2. In addition to the antioxidative properties, this peptide also had a role in anti-inflammation with ex vivo conditions by suppressing (p ≤ 0.01) mice splenocytes proliferation and enhancing the phagocytosis of murine peritoneal macrophages. Peptide treatment was also found to reduce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine (IFN-γ) and elevated the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 in splenocytes culture supernatants. Besides, the hexapeptide showed 0.91 ± 0.04% intact transport across the Caco-2 cell monolayer with an apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of 4.75 × 10−5 cm min−1 using a transcytosis mediated mechanism.

     "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of 4 lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. casei and L. plantarum, on the flavor profile of fermented apple juice. The changes in bacterial populations, concentrations of organic acids and overall volatile aroma compounds were monitored during fermentation (0–80 h) and after 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of refrigerated storage. All 4 strains exhibited a good capacity for growth in the apple juice. L. casei and L. rhamnosus produced larger concentrations of total acids and showed higher microbial viability than the other strains. The formation of lactic acid at the expense of malic acid was a common feature of the fermented samples, and this trend was most evident in the samples containing L. acidophilus . The aromatic profiles of the fermented juices were characterized by the presence of 53 volatile compounds. By using an electronic nose, we were able to discriminate among the different samples during refrigerated storage. While most of the volatile compounds associated with the typical aroma of apple juice were retained or enriched after fermentation and storage, some new compounds like acetaldehydes and ketones were generated from the fermentation by LAB. L. acidophilus affected the volatile profiles of the fermented juice more than the other strains. It significantly increased the important aromatic components: 2-ethylhexanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol and ethyl acetate.",

     "abstract": "High rates of oxidation during hydrolysis are one the main problems with hydrolysate production from fatty fishes such as Sind sardines. The purpose of this study was to control oxidation by different pretreatments with pistachio green hull (PGH) extracts as an antioxidant. Different enzyme levels (1.3%, 2.5%, and 5%), pretreatments of fish mince (washing, defatting, fish protein isolate (FPI)), and the addition of PGH as well as nitrogen gas treatment were studied on lipid oxidation during hydrolysis of Sind sardines (Sardinella sindensis). The antioxidant properties of the hydrolysates were also studied. Results for thiobarbituric acid reactive substances indicated that the nitrogen gas and 5% (w/w) enzymatic treatment significantly decreased lipid oxidation along with having a higher degree of hydrolysis and higher antioxidant activity for the hydrolysate. FPI was more effective than washing in controlling oxidation while defatting using isopropanol was the most effective. PGH (260 µg/ml) effectively controlled the oxidation of mince and washed mince (P < 0.05) but it was not effective for FPI as seen by the higher oxidation of heme-pigments and weaker metal chelating activity of PGH. Interaction of hydrolysates from all treatments and PGH showed significant combined DPPH radical scavenging and metal chelating activity (P < 0.05). Therefore, defatting using isopropanol and addition of an antioxidant such as PGH can effectively be used for inhibition of lipid oxidation during hydrolysis and improvement of antioxidant activity of hydrolysates.",

The results showed that resveratrol was solubilized using BSA at a molar ratio of 2.3:1 of resveratrol:BSA. FTIR and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques verified the formation of the BSA-resveratrol complex. The results of UV spectroscopy showed that the formation of the complex significantly protected resveratrol from UV-induced isomerization. The FRAP values for resveratrol-BSA were decreased compared to free resveratrol (57% in 30:30 resveratrol-BSA, 39% in 90–90 resveratrol-BSA and 25% in 300:300 resveratrol-BSA μM concentration). ORAC assays showed an almost 3 folds decrease in antioxidant activity of resveratrol after 3 days; however, ORAC values for BSA-resveratrol complexes were not significantly changed.

Although the wax addition increased the opacity and yellowness of gelatin films, both the UV/visible light and water vapor barriers were successfully improved gradually with increasing wax levels, and B was more effective than C. Addition of 10% and 15% wax significantly reduced the water solubility and WVP (P ≤ 0.05). However, the mechanical properties of gelatin-wax films were not strengthened compared with control. As wax levels increased, the resulting films became more brittle, harder, and less stretchable. SEM showed GB films have more uniform surfaces and compact cross-sections compared with GC films. All films showed antioxidant activity against DPPH and hydroxyl radicals, and iron reducing; however, the effects obtained with the gelatin-wax films were not significantly different from the G films (P > 0.05). Based on FTIR analysis, all films showed amide absorption regions, but GB films showed higher intensity of absorption peaks for lipid functional groups than GC films.

However, the activity and thermal stability of these peptides are relatively poor, limiting their applications. The ACE-inhibitory peptides with high activity and stability prepared from sea cucumber (Acaudina molpadioidea) protein were modified using the plastein reaction. The mechanism of the plastein reaction was investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and differential scanning calorimetry. FTIR data suggested that the plastein products had a new absorption peak at 1250 cm−1, which suggested the occurrence of the plastein reaction. Two new diffraction peaks appeared at 7.9 and 13.6° in the XRD spectra, and they indicated that new products were obtained from the peptides. The thermal stability of peptides after the plastein reaction was enhanced, and the thermal transition temperature of the peptides increased from 120° to 134°C. Urea and SDS decreased the plastein stability, thus suggesting that non-covalent interactions, such as hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds, are important for the plastein reaction. Accordingly, the plastein reaction has the potential to enhance the activity of peptides. Therefore, it can possibly be used as an effective method for increasing the application of marine active peptides and possibly other bioactive peptides.",

This traditional fermented cereal product is produced with fermentation of a dough prepared by mixing wheat flour, yoghurt, some vegetables and spices. To understand the relationship between aroma development and certain starter cultures through both statistical and sensorial approaches, 11 tarhana dough samples were prepared using three lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus farciminis PFC83, Lactobacillus casei PFC90, Lactobacillus alimentarius PFC91) or two yeast (Pichia kudriavzevii PFC12, Candida humilis PFC138) strains, as mono- or co-culture. Ester and alcohol volatiles accumulated during fermentation in the tarhana dough samples with starter, triggered by the use of starter cultures. Additionally, it was noted that lactic, succinic and acetic acids were the most prevalent organic acids to be produced in the dough samples during fermentation, and a partial least squares regression analysis showed that L. alimentarius PFC91 and P. kudriavzevii PFC126 were correlated with the accumulation of esters and these organic acids. Moreover, a sensory analysis showed that tarhana dough samples prepared using the L. alimentarius PFC91 and P. kudriavzevii PFC126 strains obtained the most acceptable scores. In conclusion, this study showed a strong correlation between aroma development in tarhana and starter usage in which L. alimentarius PFC91 is co-cultured with P. kudriavzevii PFC126, contributing to the accumulation of the volatile aromatic compounds and organic acids that are responsible for desirable aromatic tarhana.",

Fermentation assays were done with or without the addition of starter culture (i.e., Lactobacillus plantarum LPBR01), and kinetic parameters, including microbial growth, sugar pulp consumption and metabolite production, were studied. High lactic acid bacteria (reaching 10.7 log CFU/ml at 10 h) were obtained in the STR process with the starter culture, which led to a high lactic acid productivity (0.366 g/l h) and a pH decrease to below 4.0 during the initial 10 h. A temporal analysis using Illumina high-throughput 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing (HTS) showed the Lactobacillus genus's dominance in the inoculation process, as it reached over 88% of read sequences at the end of fermentation, while the Leuconostocaceae family was the dominant bacterial group in the spontaneous treatment. The STR fermentation process led to the production of coffee beans with richer aroma composition and beverages with a notable increase in the sensorial analysis of the coffee beverages compared to those resulting from the conventional process. This new fermentation model can be used to do controlled bean fermentation to supply the coffee industry with homogeneous and high-quality coffee beans.",

Gelatins obtained from freeze drying (FG) and spray drying with inlet temperatures of 160 (S160), 180 (S180) and 200 °C (S200) were characterized. All samples had α- and β-chains as the predominant constituents. The lightness decreased and samples became more yellowish and reddish as spray drying inlet temperature increased (P < 0.05). FG showed the highest gel strength, followed by S160, S200 and S180 (P < 0.05). FG also had the highest band intensity of α- and β-chains. Fourier transform infrared spectra of spray dried samples showed the highest loss of triple-helix structure. Spray dried gelatin showed higher solubility than freeze dried gelatin (P < 0.05). Fishy odor was more intense in FG compared to those obtained using spray drying (P < 0.05). Fishy odor intensity decreased as drying temperature increased (P < 0.05) and this was in agreement with the lower values observed for thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, peroxides and volatile compounds including aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols.

Functional groups were confirmed using FT-IR-spectrum, which mainly showed ester sulfate groups and with a shift in the peak values measured at higher concentrations of KOH. All the formulated films were opaque and flexible with a thickness between 30.5 and 34.1 µm (moisture: 11.4–14%). All of the films had good viscoelastic properties (power law exponents (n′) being 0.34–0.98) and showed a ‘gel like’ behavior. The X-ray-diffractogram peak showed 2 theta at 28.4°, 37.2°, and 50.4° and was consistent with an amorphous structure. The endothermic peaks varied between 119 and 131 °C. Higher solubility was obtained in SRC films prepared with 24% KOH. Among all the formulated films, water vapor permeability ranged between 8.5 and 12.2 × 10−10 g Pa−1 s−1 m−1 and with high tensile strength ranging between 38.1 and 47.5 MPa.

     "abstract": "Food fermentation technologies have developed through years of experience rather than scientific findings. Therefore, many small-scale manufacturers are unwilling to accept changes and to modify fermentation processes. Still, traditional fermented foods have had an essential role in human nutrition for thousands of years. A wide range of diverse cereals, legumes, vegetables, fruits, fish, seafood, and meat are used as raw materials for the production of these fermented foods by back-slopping (a process where material from a previous successful batch is added to facilitate the initiation of a new batch) or naturally occurring microorganisms. Various microorganisms that influence the quality, safety, sensory properties, acceptability, and consistency of these products are present. Lactic acid bacteria with their beneficial characteristics are generally a significant contributor. Identification and profiling of microorganisms in fermented foods are of particular interest. But so far such information has not been explored in detail for some fermented products from the lower Mekong subregion. Improving the safety, quality, and acceptability of fermented foods, while reducing their production costs and maintaining their authenticity and uniqueness, is important. This can be achieved through starter culture application and greater attention to food safety, such as HACCP approaches. Recent scientific advances have led to the development of defined microbial starters, leading to the transfer of artisanal food production to more controlled and industrialized fermentation. The aim of this review is to determine the gaps in the knowledge of traditional fermented foods of the lower Mekong subregion and to present current information on the diversity of involved microorganisms. These data will be helpful for defining future strategies toward the sustainable production of safe fermented foods particularly those from southeast Asia.",

Nanoemulsion preparation was optimized for parameters such as surfactant type, surfactant concentration and sonication time to achieve minimum droplet diameter with higher physical stability. Results showed that surfactant concentration had inverse relationships with droplet diameter; however, increasing sonication time in Tween 20 and Tween 80 systems had different effects on droplets diameter. A transparent, stable nanoemulsion with droplet diameter of 70 nm was prepared with Tween 80 at a concentration of 0.75%. Thermal stability analysis showed that the nanoemulsions were stable when heated to 65 °C and then cooled to 25 °C. Before development of nanoemulsion-filled hydrogels, the brittle structure of the κ-carrageenan gel (0.25%) with the highest amount of syneresis was improved by the addition of the soluble part of gum tragacanth at a concentration of 0.6%. Optically transparent filled hydrogels were formed by incorporating cumin essential oil nanoemulsions into carrageenan-tragacanth gels. The textural properties of the mixed gels did not change noticeably after the nanoemulsion droplets were incorporated. This approach may, therefore, be useful for the incorporation of various types of lipophilic bioactive agents into functional food gels.",

     "abstract": "Citrus reticulata ‘Blanco’ peel is a byproduct of red oranges, which are commonly grown in Sichuan Province, China. An optimized protocol involving ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was developed to extract phytochemicals from the peel for analysis. The parameters of the optimized UAE were as follows: ratio of 85% ethanol to orange peels at 20:1 (ml/g), duration of 40 min, temperature of 50 °C, powder mesh size of 100, and ultrasound power of 150 W. The yields of the two main phytochemicals, namely, tangeretin and nobiletin, extracted using UAE were 1.5 times higher than those obtained using conventional solvent extraction (CSE). HPLC–DAD–ESI–MS2 analysis showed that the efficiency of UAE in recovering tangeretin and nobiletin from red orange peel was higher than that of CSE.",

Contrary to previous results, proteins with lower surface hydrophobicity were preferred for beer foam stability. Among all proteins, protein Z was the most prevalent protein in beer foam and could be accurately measured using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The quantity of protein Z was found to be positively correlated with beer foam stability. The addition of purified protein Z from barley (Hordeum vulgare) malt into the finished beer could enhance the beer foam stability. Therefore, proteins with lower surface hydrophobicity might be beneficial for beer foam stability, especially protein Z.",

Preliminary screening of the methanol extracts of its leaves, stems, rhizomes showed that the fresh leaves had the highest antioxidant activity, with total phenolic content (TPC), ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity (AEAC), and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values of 1020 ± 20 mg GAE/100 g, 1130 ± 30 mg AAE/100 g, and 140 ± 30 µmol TE/g, respectively. Subsequently, a diarylheptanoid, etlingerin, was isolated from the leaf methanol extract. When contrasted with curcumin (a well-known diarylheptanoid), etlingerin showed comparable free radical scavenging properties. However, using a cell-based antioxidant assay, etlingerin showed significantly better protective effects (with cellular antioxidant activity values as high as 84 ± 4%) than curcumin at all concentrations tested. In the cytoprotective study, only etlingerin could protect cells that were challenged with hydrogen peroxide. These effects might be explained by etlingerin's high lipophilicity and good free radical scavenging properties. Etlingerin was also found to be significantly less cytotoxic than curcumin (up to 10-fold, as determined using a MTT cell viability assay), thus suggesting its safety. The work showed that etlingerin has better antioxidant properties, hence highlighting its potential as a functional food component that could reduce the risks of oxidative stress-related diseases.",

It was found that UMVF accounts for the highest moisture loss rate with the increase of microwave power and frying temperature. Considering the oil uptake rate, UMVF could reduce oil content by 16–20% compared to VF and MVF. UMVF chips also had better texture and the most acceptable color characteristics among the frying techniques studied.

Propyl gallate (PG) and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) were selected as the antioxidant, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus was used as the probiotic model. L. rhamnosus bacteria were exposed to PG and TBHQ and their resistance was assessed. Afterwards, the cell-free supernatants (CFS) of untreated bacteria (CFSU), PG treated bacteria (CFSP) and TBHQ treated bacteria (CFST) were isolated. The human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29 was then exposed to isolated CFS and subjected to geno- and cytotoxicity assays and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) apoptosis/necrosis detection evaluation. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-Yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay showed that CFSP and CFST were able to inhibit HT-29 growth with IC50 values of 70 and 120 μg/mL at 24 h, respectively, whereas CFSU showed no significant toxicity. DNA fragmentation was observed in the CFSP and CFST treated HT-29 cells, shown using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) staining. An annexin V flow cytometry assay showed that the cells treated with CFSP and CFST resulted in 35% and 32% apoptosis, respectively. The qPCR results showed that the expression of pro-apoptotic caspase 9 gene was significantly increased in CFSP and CFST treated HT-29 cells compared with CFSU treated cells (P ≤ 0.05), whereas the expression of the pro-survival Bcl-xL gene was downregulated in the CFSP and CFST treated cells compared with CFSU treated cells (P ≤ 0.05). In conclusion, different food additives may affect the metabolomics of probiotics, which could subsequently influence human health.",

The encapsulation of GOX was acceptably optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). An immobilization yield of 73% was obtained with 22 g L−1 Na-alginate, 20 g L−1 carboxymethylcellulose, and 12 g L−1 CaCl2. The apparent Km value of the immobilized GOX (4.55 mM) was slightly higher than that of the soluble enzyme (3.99 mM) and the activation energy was similar (~ 35 kJ mol−1). The encapsulated enzyme maintained about 68% and 92% of its initial activity at pH 3.0 and 4.0, respectively. Moreover, GOX-loaded alginate hollow beads could be re-used with 7 reaction cycles in model must, with a final reaction efficacy of 37%. GOX was successfully encapsulated in Ca-alginate hollow beads, and their catalytic potential remained unaffected by the immobilization process. In view of these results and the activity of the immobilized enzyme at the acidic pH of the must, this encapsulated biocatalyst is a promising alternative for industrial use in the production of reduced-alcohol wines.",

The PEE of each species was fractionated using membrane chromatography to give an anthocyanin-enriched fraction (AF) and a copigment fraction (CF). A significant increase in the SOD activity was observed with a dose-response effect after an overnight incubation of AGS cells with the PEE, AF and CF from the selected species. The activity of CAT was enhanced by the CF of Ribes magellanicum and R. cucullatum, and by the AF of R. punctatum. For the GSH-R, a dose-response effect was observed in the extracts of R. magellanicum, while for the GSH-Px activity, only the AF of R. magellanicum and R. cucullatum had a significant increase. The studied samples were not able to increase the intracellular GSH content. Only the R. magellanicum samples raised the intracellular total antioxidant activity. These results suggested that the increase in the activity of the antioxidant response enzymes is associated with the cytoprotective effect of these native currants.",

The effects of albumen to water ratios (1:0, 1:1. 1:3 and 1:5, w/w) and pH-shift versions (acid and alkaline processes and direct pI precipitation) on protein yield and salt reduction were also studied. The higher the ratio of water added the lower the protein yield obtained for all pH driven methods. The highest protein yield (31%) was found using the acid-shift process without extra water. However, salt removal efficacy from the protein isolate was improved by increasing water added. To enhance the protein recovery, several flocculants were used with the acid process. Maximum protein yield of 36% was obtained when κ-carrageenan was used. Doubly washing the protein isolate with cold water with vacuum filtration further increased salt removal (49%) with the lowest protein loss. Therefore, an acid pH-shift process with the aid of κ-carrageenan and post-washing had the best potential for recovering protein and eliminating salt from over-salted albumen. The optimum process can recover protein up to 31% with 74% salt removal.

Therefore, the current study has focused on the production of biodegradable food packaging from renewable materials, primarily gelatin. The effect of the biomaterials used on functional properties of the films produced needs thorough investigation. Gelatin represents interesting biomaterials for developing biodegradable food packaging, mainly due to their good film forming properties and abundantly in nature. However, the incorporation of gelatin in biodegradable films for food packaging may give some drawback on certain properties of the film such as tensile strength and water vapour permeability. Thus, addition of plasticizers into the film materials improves the functional properties of films by increasing their extensibility, dispensability, flexibility, elasticity, and rigidity. This study aims to review the current findings on how plasticizers impact the functional properties of biodegradable gelatin-based films. Plasticizers incorporation in the films may affect the continuity of the polymer matrix, leading to physical changes, where the films become more flexible and stretchable. Generally, the plasticization effect of plasticizers strengthens the film structure, in which the tensile strength and elongation of the films are improved and water barrier properties are reduced.",

Particle size (62.3–68.8 µm) of both the flours was significantly different and further, the flowability of non-basmati rice flour was significantly affected by its particle shape (circularity 0.552), surface roughness (129.46 nm) and compressibility (28.50%), making it more cohesive than basmati rice flour. Also, basic flow energy, stability index and specific energy was significantly higher in non-basmati flour, thus required more energy (192.27mJ) to flow than basmati rice flour (167.42mJ). Overall, the flowability was analysed at three different pressures (3,6 and 9kPa) and the non-basmati rice flour was found less flowable as indicated by the flow function coefficient (1.62at 9kPa) in comparison to basmati (2.29at 9kPa) creating difficulty in bulk handling.",

     "abstract": "Mechanical properties, specifically, viscoelastic properties of food materials are the most important characteristics which change significantly while drying is in progress. These changes of the viscoelastic properties have a great impact on the deformation of food material during drying. Understanding of the nature of this changing viscoelastic property is crucial for developing a realistic mathematical model for deformation during food drying. The viscoelastic properties of fresh food samples have been predicted using classical models such as Maxwell model and Burgers model. However, due to the diverse nature of food material, these models cannot predict various viscoelastic properties accurately (relaxation modulus, relaxation time, stiffness, coefficient of viscosity and creep compliance) during drying as conditions are continuously changed. In this context, the fractional viscoelastic model is proposed in this study as a new approach for predicting the accurate viscoelastic behaviour for food materials during drying. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to develop and validate a viscoelastic model for characterizing viscoelastic properties of food material during drying using fractional viscoelastic model. The proposed model is used to capture the changes of the viscoelastic properties of the food materials during drying. Proposed model is validated by comprehensive experiments as predicted results very closely matched with experimental results. It is found that the fractional order ( ψ ) changes exponentially with the moisture content, whereas the stiffness ( χ ) shows third order polynomial change with the moisture content. Interestingly, it is found that the material behaviour is dependent on strain rate while applying the monotonic compression load on the fresh apple tissue at different constant strain rates.",

These lactic acid bacteria were previously isolated from traditionally made cheese from Southeastern Serbia. Evaluation of the effect of different environmental conditions on the planktonic growth, biofilm formation and formed biofilm were determined by spectrophotometric method. The limiting factor for the planktonic growth of tested bacteria was the salt concentration above 6.5%, while temperature of 4 °C was limiting factor for planktonic growth and biofilm formation. Temperature of 37 °C as well as various concentrations of glucose and lactose, stimulated planktonic growth and biofilm formation of all tested bacteria, except E. hirae KGPMF9. S. uberis KGPMF2 showed no ability of biofilm formation. Tested bacteria showed better planktonic growth and ability of biofilm formation in acidic media.

For this purpose, exudate gums were chosen which included commercially used acacia and karaya gum. The properties were compared with an underutilised gum exuded from apricot tree, called apricot gum. Monosaccharide composition and linkages in gum polysaccharides were studied using Electron spray ionization-mass spectrometry coupled with time-of-flight analyser (ESI-MS-TOF). The assay involves ionization of gum polysaccharides by passing their organic solution into electric field and converting them into a mist of charged droplets that are further analysed and detected using Time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Relative array of peaks elucidated the presence of glucosyl, galactosyl and a small proportion of uronic acid units in all gums. Spectral fragmentation distribution was bimodal with polydispersity values greater than or equal to two (Mw/Mn ≥ 2). In all the antioxidant assays, methanol and ethanol were separately used for extraction. Total phenolic content, ferrous ion chelating ability and reducing power of the gums varied from 0.44 to 1.25 mg GAE/g, 11.80–60.42% and 0.12–0.23 AAE/g, respectively. The DPPH radical scavenging ability (12.03–27.23%) and bile acid binding activity (40.98–46.60%) of the gums was also high.

An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method was used for phytochemical determination. Quinic acid, malic acid, protocatechuic acid, p-coumaric acid, and hesperidin were common in the six Silene species. All extracts showed higher antibacterial effects compared to streptomycin and ampicillin (except S. dichotoma). Antifungal agents, bifonazole (MIC 0.10–0.20 mg/mL and MFC 0.20–0.30 mg/mL) and ketoconazole (MIC 0.15–2.30 mg/mL and MFC 0.20–3.50 mg/mL) showed lower activity than the investigated Silene species extracts. S. alba inhibited AChE (2.00 mg GALAE/g extract) and BChE (1.0 mg GALAE/g extract). The results showed metal chelating potential ranging from 12 to 19 mg EDTAE/g extract, with S. conoidea being the most active, and S. supina the least.

However, the extra charge and decreasing surface tension of egg white/yolk dispersions at pH > 7.0/NaCl ≥ 0.6% resulted in the destabilization of foams. The emulsifying stability of egg yolk dispersions continued climbing to pH 10.0 due to the continuous reduction of particle size and started declining with the slow decrease amplitude of particle size at NaCl > 1.8%, thus z-average particle size is the main factor that dominates the emulsifying stability index of egg yolk dispersions.

Its characterization upon soybean meal (SBM) and corn husk (CH) was carried out. The effect was estimated in terms of cellulose reduction and protein and starch digestibility, besides the content of phenolic compounds (PC) and their profiles. Enzymatic hydrolysis caused 34% cellulose reduction in SBM whereas, in CH, it was 55%. In CH, the reduction promoted PC release (21%). The greatest change in the antioxidant activity after hydrolysis was found in phenolic compounds soluble in methanol (PCSM), a fact that could be attributed to concomitant reduction in ferulic acid and increase in hydroxybenzoic acid. In SBM, the activity of the cellulolytic complex caused increases in protein (74%) and starch (95%) digestibility. Therefore, available protein in SBM can be used as food supplement and thickener whereas PC derived from CH may be applied as food additive.",

     "abstract": "Soy milk, a water extract of soybean, can provide a plentiful and inexpensive supply of proteins. Besides, other nutritive components such as lipids, vitamins, minerals, isoflavones, flavonoids, saponins, and bioactive peptides found in soy milk are known to have therapeutic values. Conversely, the presence of indigestible oligosaccharides and beany flavor have limited the wide consumption of soy milk. α-Galactosidase enzyme are known to hydrolyze these flatulence causing oligosaccharides. In this context, this study evaluated the α-galactosidases production potential and oligosaccharides reduction pattern of six Lactobacillus isolates during growth in soy milk. All the strains were efficiently grown in soy milk with viable count ranging from 5.7 to 10.4 Log10 cfu/ml during 24 h of fermentation. All the strains were found proteolytic in nature represented varied degree of proteolysis at each fermentation step investigated. The highest proteolysis was observed by LR C34 (638.56 ± 7.9 µg serine/ml) after 24 h of fermentation. Among studied Lactobacillus strains LR C8 displayed highest cumulative α-galactosidases activity between 6 and 18 h of incubation. Correspondingly, the highest utilization of sucrose and stachyose was also showed by LR C8. Overall, sucrose and raffinose were reduced maximum upto 24 h of fermentation in comparison to stachyose by studied lactobacilli. Interestingly, more than 90% reduction in stachyose given by LR C8 was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than other strains, which recorded less than 37% utilization of said tetrasaccharide. Thus, these strains can be further explored for the preparation of soy based functional fermented foods and bioactive food supplements.",

     "abstract": "Our knowledge of the complex domestication process originates from a small subset of crops. Non-starch polysaccharides are abundant in cladodes (“nopalitos”) of the Opuntia genus, which people consume as vegetables. Chemical characteristics of these polysaccharides often respond to the species domestication. In this study, we assess the partial chemical variation of cladode non-starch polysaccharides in Opuntia, in a domestication gradient. For it, we isolated mucilage, pectins, and hemicelluloses. The degree of esterification, methylation and total galacturonic acid for mucilage and pectins were determined. Also, to calculate structural protein content in those polysaccharides the total nitrogen was measured. A completely randomized experimental design was used, including 14 Opuntia variants of five species and six replicates. The degree of mucilage esterification (58.26–69.95%) and pectins (59.43–69.68%), and the degree of methylation of mucilage (25.24–28.66%) were independent of the domestication level. In contrast, the degree of pectins methylation (24.48–27.16%) was higher in wild species than in the domesticated. Total galacturonic acid content in mucilage (1.83–4.10 mMol 100 mg−1 dry biomass) and pectins (6.46–10.33 mMol 100 mg−1 dry biomass) was higher in domesticated species than in the wild ones. However, the content of structural protein in pectins (2.45–2.9%), loosely bound hemicelluloses (0.21–0.28%) and tightly bound hemicelluloses (0.45–0.79%) was higher in wild species. Chemical characteristics of structural polysaccharides significantly vary with domestication, probably a consequence of selection pressure for wide agricultural environments.",

Results showed that phycocyanin degraded significantly without any sugar addition. The addition of glucose could increase the activation energy by up to fourfold due to the polymerization of protein phycocyanin by sugar, and glucose could prevent damage of the phycocyanin structure. Phycocyanin underwent discoloration from bright blue to faint blue after heating at 80 °C.

The conditions of impregnation (pH4~6, temperature 50–60 °C and time 6.0 h) showed the effects of the supported catalysts on the soybean oil hydrogenation process. The Si values of the six catalysts were respectively 32.22, 23.12, 24.26, 29.48, 20.97, and 23.17, under supercritical CO2 conditions. This clearly indicates that the addition of the precious metals promoter significantly reduced the trans fatty acid (TFA) content. When soybean oil was hydrogenated with Cu-Ag/SBA15 catalyst, the selectivity of the linoleic acid was 1.8 times higher than with Cu-Pd/SBA15. When the soybean oil was hydrogenated with Ni-Ag/SBA15 catalyst, the selectivity of the linoleic acid was 1.3 times higher than with Cu-Pd/SBA15. Soybean oil was hydrogenated first with Cu-Ag/SBA15 for 20 min. Then, the hydrogenated soybean oil was purified from the catalyst and hydrogenated again with Ni-Ag/SBA15 for 60 min. The content of oleic acid was up to 50.27% and the content of TFA was lowered to 10.43%.This paper discusses the preparation process parameters of several representative catalysts for the hydrogenation of soybean oil. The functions of precious metals in hydrogenation reactions are discussed. Kinetic parameters and the selectivity of hydrogenated soybean oil were compared between different supported catalysts. A new method of stepwise hydrogenation is proposed, which can effectively control the unsaturated fat content after hydrogenation. High content of oleic acid in hydrogenated oil was obtained in the current study. This finding will have a wide range of industrial applications in fats and oils industry.",

Sprouting showed an increase in protein, ash and fibre content with decrease in fat and carbohydrate content of onion powders. Functional properties (water solubility index, hygoscopicity, dispersibility and wettability) improved in sprouted powders as compared to the unsprouted powders. Sprouted onion powders showed lower elastic modulus (G′) and viscous modulus (G') in the linear viscoelastic region as compared to unsprouted powders. Sprouted powders recorded significantly (P < 0.05) higher glass transition temperature than the unsprouted powders. The morphological pattern which differed in both types of powders was determined by scanning electron microscopy. The increased protein content accounted for increase in particle size and solubility index thereby decreasing the viscosity as reflected by lower elastic (G′) modulus in sprouted onion powders. The improvements in composition and quality parameters were seen in all the cultivars tested showing that sprouting could be beneficial for product development across cultivars.",

Therefore, a great interest in the effective use of agro byproducts with improved nutritional, functional and another health promoting properties by solid state fermentation. So, here in present study the effect of solid state fermentation on phenolic contents, antioxidants and functional properties of fermented and non fermented peanut press cake by GRAS fungal strain A. awamori was examined.

Whereas in case of tannin content the maximum value was found at 144 h after incubation. Furthermore in antioxidants as well as functional properties significant (p < .0.5) increase was observed in fermented samples except then bulk density. It was confirmed from the extract analysis that fermented samples have high phenolic, antioxidant and functional properties then the non fermented ones because many biochemical changes occur during fermentation, so fermentation has been used to improve or transformed the proportion of nutritive and antinutritive constituents of substrates, which changes the product properties like biochemical or functional.",

The antagonistic activities were compared to L. acidophilus, a reference probiotic strain. In addition, metabolic activity of bacterial pathogens upon CFSs challenge was also determined by MTT assay. LAB CFSs inhibited pathogen growth to a varied degree. A decrease in the number of sessile pathogen cells was observed upon exposure with untreated CFS, under both post and co-incubation strategy. The CFS of GM12, GM13, GM15 and GM17 could effectively inhibit the biofilm formation of both the pathogens to a significant level (p < 0.05) varying between 72% and 86%. Upon principal component analysis of recorded data, untreated CFS from GM12 emerged to be most promising against both the test biofilm formers. N-CFS and H-CFS preparations also limited the biofilm formation, however to a lower extent than untreated form. As also determined by MTT assay, the metabolic activity of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were significantly reduced upon CFS exposure. The light microscopic images depicted major disruption in the biofilm matrix of pathogenic strains upon CFS challenge. Findings from this study indicate that the Lactobacillus strains of goat milk origin screened in this study may serve as bio-control agents for prophylactic use to prevent infections.",

     "abstract": "Blueberries are a widely consumed fruit known for their high antioxidant content. Due to their short shelf life at refrigerated temperatures, they can be frozen or dried to overcome perishability limitations. Liquid nitrogen pretreatment may be able to increase the permeability of blueberries’ skin, thereby amplifying the effects of osmotic dehydration through increased transfer of moisture and solids. This study evaluated the effects of liquid nitrogen pretreatment on osmotic dehydration and the resulting physicochemical properties of cryogenically frozen blueberries. Blueberries were immersed in liquid nitrogen (− 196 °C) for 10 s and then thawed. Pretreated and un-pretreated samples were placed in a 60°Brix sucrose solution (40 °C) for 8 h, followed by cryogenic freezing. Liquid nitrogen pretreated blueberries experienced greater moisture loss and solids gain than un-pretreated samples after osmotic dehydration, while having similar anthocyanin and total phenolic contents. This study demonstrated that liquid nitrogen pretreatment facilitates water and sugar diffusion in blueberries during osmotic dehydration while maintaining nutritional quality.",

The experimental data were adjusted by several sorption models, and the GAB equation was the one that best represented the experimental data, being chosen to predict the adsorption and desorption behaviors of the films for the ranges studied of water activity (0.043–0.888) and of temperatures (20–50 °C). The chitosan-glycerol films presented higher values of monolayer moisture and lower heat involved in the monolayer compared to the pure chitosan films. The values of net isosteric heat and of differential entropy for the films increased exponentially with the moisture content decrease. Dry films with moisture content (Xe) lower than 0.10 kg kg−1 (dry basis) presented morphological changes according to the isosteric heat and entropy curves, indicating water sorption more easily and the more amorphous material (crystallinity of 9%). While dry films at Xe = 0.40 kg kg−1 (dry basis) maintained the characteristic of semicrystalline material (crystallinity of 33%). The enthalpy–entropy compensation showed that the process was controlled by the enthalpy and, it was only spontaneous for the samples in adsorption. The films were classified as a micro and mesoporous materials, and the average pores sizes were from 0.6 to 17 nm for desorption and, from 0.7 to 21 nm for adsorption.",

Okara was added to rice noodles in proportions of 0%, 5%, 10%, and 20%. With an increasing level of okara, cooking loss, hardness, and adhesiveness of the rice noodles increased, while water absorption, swelling index, and cohesiveness decreased. The addition of okara reduced the in vitro starch digestibility of rice noodles, although the addition of 20% okara increased the starch digestibility. Among all samples, 10% okara showed the lowest predicted glycemic index (pGI) value. Therefore, in order to improve cooking quality of rice noodles containing 10% okara, addition of alginate or treatment with a CaCl2 coating was examined. The addition of alginate alone did not improve the cooking quality, but treatment with a CaCl2 coating along with alginate improved cooking quality. Moreover, the combination treatment of Ca-alginate did not change the in vitro starch digestibility of rice noodles containing okara. As a result, 10% okara can be used to produce health-beneficial rice noodles with reduced in vitro starch digestibility, and the combination treatment of Ca-alginate can improve their cooking quality.",

However, brown rice treated by EMA had higher retention rate of free phenolic content, free antioxidant activity, and total identified free phenolic acids than that treated by ETA at different enzyme levels, although the corresponding reducing sugars produced by EMA were lower than by ETA. These results indicated that the extrusion temperature had greater effect on the phenolic retention than enzymatic hydrolysis during enzymatic extrusion. In addition, brown rice treated by EMA with 0.5% enzyme had a high retention of free flavonoids at 72.4%.

A number of studies have investigated the effect of ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) conditions on the recovery of phenolics derived from citrus waste using both organic solvents or mixed aqueous solvent systems. To maximize efficiency, UAE conditions should be tailored to the physical parameters of the solvent(s) employed. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of four UAE parameters: particle size (1.40–2.80 mm), extraction time (10–60 min), extraction temperature (23–50 °C) and ultrasonic power (150–250 W) on the simultaneous recovery of p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and hesperidin from citrus waste using pure water as a solvent. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed for the identification and quantification of the cited compounds. Particle size was determined to be an important parameter affecting compound recovery, with the exception of chlorogenic acid. A particle size of 1.40 mm resulted in the highest recovery of p-coumaric and caffeic acids (0.25 and 0.58 mg/g, respectively), while higher hesperidin yields were achieved from the particle sizes of 2.00 and 1.40 mm (6.44 and 6.27 mg/g, respectively). Extraction temperature significantly affected only the recovery of the flavanone glycoside (P < 0.05). As the extraction temperature increased from 30 to 50 °C the recovery of hesperidin increased from 6.59 to 7.84 mg/g, respectively.

Apple puree artificially contaminated with high-dose patulin (125, 250 and 500 μg/mL) was fermented by FF1-2 for 10 days, and over 97% of patulin was degraded in the apple purees after fermentation, and the maximal degradation of patulin was 98.5%. Physicochemical analysis demonstrated that after 10 days of fermentation, the pH and the amount of reducing sugars in the apple puree decreased significantly. The volatile profile assessment of fermented apple puree obtained from HS-SPME/GC-MS indicated that the amounts of acids, aldehydes and ketones decreased, and the content of aroma-active compounds mainly aliphatic alcohols and esters, were significantly increased after FF1-2 fermentation. In addition, further reports of sensory evaluation also revealed good acceptability of the fermented apple puree. Thus, FF1-2 not only effectively degraded patulin in apple puree, but improved quality of apple puree, especially the aroma profile. These findings indicate that FF1-2 has a promising application for controlling mycotoxin contamination and quality improvement in juice production industry.",

It has minimal impact on taste, nutrients, flavor, and freshness of food. Therefore, HPP is highly acceptable technique to inhibit the growth and toxins of foodborne pathogens in food matrices. In the present study, HPP technology with thermal variation was applied to control the growth, and level of deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA) in maize grains adopting response surface methodology (RSM). The spore inactivation activity by means of HPP was studied by spore germination inhibition in peptone water and complete inactivation was observed at 380 MPa and 60 °C for 30 min. Propidium iodide staining revealed that HPP inactivates the spores by damaging the membrane integrity. RSM experiment was executed using central composite design (CCD) with the association of independent factors of pressure (MPa), temperature (°C), and pressure-holding time (min) and results were assessed by second order polynomial equation. Conversely, the regression analysis of all the responses (reduction in CFU%, DON%, and ZEA%) was conducted by fitting the suitable model. The responses were significant (p < 0.05) and fitted well with the quadratic model. The CFU, DON, and ZEA were not observed in maize at 550 MPa of pressure, 45 °C of temperature, and 20 min of pressure holding time. The study concluded that HPP could be useful in agriculture and food industry to manage the growth, and level of DON and ZEA by F. graminearum in agricultural commodities.",

The gelatin fiber was encapsulated with bitter gourd extract (BGE) at 5–15% (w/w%) loading rate. Statistical analysis of scanning electron micrographs showed the encapsulation process resulted in a non-significant (P > 0.05) increase in average fiber diameter. Morphological analysis through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed fabrication of the bilayer structure as well as encapsulation of the extract. Furthermore, spectroscopic analysis by FTIR illustrated the formation of composite coaxial fibers through electrospinning process. However, encapsulation at various loading rates did not result in any chemical interaction between core and wall materials. Thermogravimetric graphs of encapsulated fibers, at all core loadings, illustrated an additional third phase, absent in non-encapsulated fibers, which confirms encapsulation occurrence. Moreover, glass transition temperature decreased in both first and second heating scans of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms due to BGE encapsulation process. Furthermore, coaxial encapsulation process managed to conserve an average of 88% of antioxidative content and potency in all cases.

Third objective was to determine the effect of 30 min pre-incubation of Caco-2 cells with various MNG preparations on the uptake of glucose. Caco-2 cells were incubated in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing (i) different concentrations of glucose (i.e. 5.5, 25 mM), (ii) different sources of glucose (i.e. sucrose, starch), (iii) different types of dietary fiber contained in different preparations of gum extracted from malva nut seeds and guar nuts.

     "abstract": "Mango by-products (peel and paste) are a source of carotenoids, but their bioaccessibility (BA) can be limited by dietary fiber (DF), since it retains these compounds within its structure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) on the BA of carotenoids by an in vitro digestion model. The β-cryptoxanthin (βCr) content (3.59 ± 0.43 mg/g DW) in UAE-peel was higher than that in Control-peel (0.66 ± 0.03 mg/g DW). The β-carotene (βC) content in UAE-peel and UAE-paste was higher than that in Control-peel and Control-paste. The %BA in the UAE-peel improved by 46.93%, 35.21% and 32.62% for βCr, Lutein (Lut), and βC, respectively, compared to that in the Control-peel, and in the UAE-paste, the treatment improved the %BA for Lut, βCr, and βC by 46.04%, 44.16%, and 44.01% respectively, compared with that of the Control-paste. A high percentage of non-bioaccessible βC was shown for the Control-peel (79.48%) and Control-paste (70.41%), and the percentage was lower in the UAE samples. The released carotenoids were quantified in a kinetic model, and β-Cr, Lut, and βC were effectively released in mango UAE-peel. The constant release rate, k, did not show significant differences in both samples. A 2-parameter non-linear regression model was the best fit for the release kinetics. The use of UAE on in vitro digestion conditions noticeably improved the bioaccessibility of carotenoids in mango by-products.",

The process of soaking decreased radical scavenging activity (RSA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), ferric ion reducing power (FRAP) and metal ion chelation activity (MICA) in all the legumes. Cooking of the soaked seeds led to further decreases in these activities. Germination improved MICA in chickpea and lentil as well as TAC in all the legumes except for white pea. IVPD increased RSA and TAC of all the legumes by 2–4 folds, while FRAP and MICA in selective legumes showed a significant contribution from the peptides released due to hydrolysis of proteins. The scavenging and reducing activities in this legume as well as other legumes were correlated with free phenolics content. However, in contrast to the chemical assay, biological assays showed no such correlation. Significant ACE inhibitory activity was observed only after IVPD of the legumes.",

     "abstract": "This work was aimed at developing an ultrasonic-assisted extraction of trans-resveratrol from red grape wastes using a new combination of solvents and response surface method- Box–Behnken design. The experiment was carried out on the industrial waste, skin, and pulp parts of 18 different types of Iranian red grapes. Ultrasound-assisted solvent extraction was carried out using different ratios of ethanol:polyethylene glycol (PEG):water (v/v), ultrasonication time, and temperature. The optimized conditions were achieved as a combination of 19.4 min, 53.6 °C, and 48:32:20 (v/v), which remarkably improved the extraction of trans-resveratrol content. The presence of PEG in the extraction medium enhanced the extraction efficiency by 39.48%. Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography ultra-violent (RP-HPLC-UV) was applied for the quantification. The amounts of trans-resveratrol varied between 68.36 ± 3.06 and 862 ± 4.67 µg/g-dry material of the initial samples based on optimized conditions. Retention time of trans-resveratrol was obtained in less than 5 min, which indicates the high accuracy of developed HPLC method. There was a significant relationship between the amount of resveratrol and antioxidant activity. Antioxidant activity of samples extracted by optimized method was about four times higher than conventional method (80:20 ethanol:water (v/v), 30 min sonication, and 60 °C temperature) measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay. This research provided food grade extraction method due to reduction in the use of ethanol in extraction process. Furthermore, the results can provide a new HPLC elution method for easy and fast detection and quantification of trans-resveratrol in industrial scale.",

Sucrose and commercial pectin (CP) or pectin extracted from passion fruit peel from Caatinga (PE) were added to beverages. Beverages without addition of sucrose or pectin were also prepared. High gravimetric yield of PE (54.93% w/w) was obtained and there was no gel formation in the beverages containing PE. Sucrose increased survival of L. rhamnosus under simulated gastrointestinal conditions (GI) in non-fermented beverages. PE increased GI survival in non-fermented and fermented beverages. After 28 days of refrigerated storage, the fermented beverages had the same lactic acid concentrations as at the initial time of storage (~1.3 g/L) and the consumption of sucrose was similar in all probiotic beverages (30%). Viabilities in the final time of storage were higher for non-fermented beverages (9 Log), regardless of type of pectin. The GI survival for all probiotic beverages had increased by the final time of storage and higher values were found when PE was added, regardless of fermentation. The low methylation degree pectin probably has stimulated the growth of L. rhamnosus ATCC 7469 during the simulation of gastrointestinal conditions.

Rheological measurements revealed that the value of elastic modulus Gʹ of FG/CG mixed gel decreased as CG content increased. This could be associated with the phase separation between the two biopolymers present in the mixed gels as visualised by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Moreover, gelling and melting temperatures also increased as the levels of CG increased (P < 0.05). However, the addition of carrageenan lowered the lightness (L*-value) but increased the redness (a*-value) of mixed gel samples. Based on fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, the interaction between FG and sulphate groups of CG occurred. This study shows that the addition of 50% CG could improve the gelling property of fish gelatin gel by increasing gel strength and melting temperature.",

In the present study, an oat based fermented product ‘probiotic fermented oat flour’ (PFOF) was developed using a probiotic strain Lactobacillus plantarum M-13 and honey. The bacterial isolate L. plantarum M-13 has previously been characterized for several probiotic functional attributes. For PFOF development, process variables, i.e., concentrations of oat flour (8.0% w/v) and honey (3.0% w/v), and incubation time (48 h) were optimized based on a Box-Behnken design. Optimization enhanced the viable cell count of L. plantarum M-13 in PFOF from 14.4 log cfu/ml (unoptimized conditions) to 16.9 log cfu/ml, i.e. by 17.4%. With respect to linear terms, the variable incubation time had the most substantial positive influence on viable cell count of L. plantarum M-13, while with respect to interactive terms, the variables incubation time and honey had the maximum effect. Good viability of L. plantarum M-13 was observed in PFOF over a period of three wk of storage at room temperature and with refrigeration. Furthermore, sugar content decreased and lactic acid content increased during storage. The PFOF remained free of Enterobacteriaceae contamination, although fungal and yeast contaminants were found.",

The frequency sweep test of BH gelatins showed independency in a wide range of frequency (1–196 Hz) regardless of whether extracted by heat or pepsin. Heat-extracted BH gelatins exhibited the highest storage modulus values (1165–1245 pa). BH gelatins extracted with the lowest concentration of pepsin showed a higher mean storage modulus value than gelatin extracted with the highest pepsin concentration. The present study is the first to demonstrate that gelatin extracted from BH collagen using heat and pepsin has characteristics comparable to other sources of gelatin, making it suitable for many applications, and confirms that the use of pepsin increases BH gelatin yield with a concomitant reduction in gelatin quality.",

Presently, several iron supplements are available; however, they are generally associated with higher oxidation and lower bioavailability. Iron forms a very stable and soluble complex with lactose. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to develop a lactose-iron complex with better oxidative stability, bioavailability and lower cytotoxicity. Oxidative stability of complex in linoleic acid emulsion was evaluated by TBA value and induction period. Iron bioavailability from the complex was estimated in Caco-2 cell model system. The impact of complex on cell viability was assessed using tetrazolium based colorimetric assay. It was observed in the present study that the ability of iron to catalyse the oxidation of lipids reduced in the form of lactose-iron complex as compared to the free form of iron. The complex also showed significantly higher (p<0.05) iron bioavailability than free iron salt. Higher mineral uptake and higher cellular ferritin formation were observed from lactose-iron complex in Caco-2 cells. It also showed lower toxicity than ferrous sulphate on Caco-2 cells. Hence, it could be safely concluded that lactose-iron complex could be an innovative iron fortificant with better oxidative stability and bioavailability for use in functional dairy foods in order to combat iron deficiency disorders.",

The values of IC50, based on sulforhodamine B (SRB) colorimetric assay, were 9.5 μM and 481.7 μM for AFB1 and FB1, respectively, showing AFB1 is more toxic to HepG2 cells than FB1. The cytotoxicity was also evidenced by substantially decreased contents of cellular DNA and ATP accompanying an increase of intracellular ROS upon exposure to AFB1(1 μM = 10% IC50), FB1 (70 μM = 10% IC50) and their combinations. After HepG2 cells were arrested in S or G0/G1 phase after exposure to mycotoxins, flow cytometry assay on the rate of apoptosis showed a synergistic interaction (p < 0.01) between AFB1 and FB1 at dosage levels with equivalent toxicity of 10% and 30% measured by SRB assay. Consistently, immunocytochemistry analysis on the expression of apoptosis related proteins showed higher expression of Bax, Caspase 3, and p53 upon exposure to combinations of AFB1 and FB1 than their individual treatments at the dosages with the same equivalent level of toxicity. In the meantime, it seems that the expression of capase-8 is antagonistic between AFB1 and FB1, which indicates the synergetic proapoptotic activity of AFB1 and FB1 is likely caused by their different mechanisms in HepG2 cell apoptosis upon mycotoxin exposure.",

Fermentation resulted in an increase in free phenolics (from 15% to 95% of total phenolic content), while a decrease in bound phenolics throughout the process. Fermentation changed the mode of polyphenol-protein interaction and promoted the release of free phenols. Meanwhile, there was an increase in peptide content (4.31% to 29.68%) within 48 h and followed by a decrease. The effects of peptides on the antioxidant activity were more significant than that of phenolic compounds in the early fermentation stage, but it was opposite in the later stage of fermentation. The antioxidant activity (~80%) was a positive correlation (R2 = 0.972 and R2 = 0.937, respectively) to both of phenolic content and peptide content during the fermentation due to the synergistic effects.

     "abstract": "Tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) is an extract of palm oil that consists of 25% α-tocopherol and 75% tocotrienols. TRF was shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, neuroprotective and cholesterol-lowering activities. Glutamate is the major mediator of excitatory signals in the mammalian central nervous system. Extreme amounts of glutamate in the extracellular spaces can lead to numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, the efficacy of oil palm TRF and α-tocopherol in protecting astrocytes against glutamate-induced cell death was studied. Specifically, the effectiveness of pre- or post-treatment of TRF and α-tocopherol upon glutamate excitotoxicity was determined by evaluating cell viability and morphology of astrocytes. Cell viability was measured using MTT assay while cell morphology was monitored under fluorescent microscope using the acridine orange/propidium iodide (AO/PI) assay. Exposure to 230 mM glutamate significantly reduced cell viability to 50% in both the pre- and post-treatment studies; however, pre- and post-treatment with TRF and α-tocopherol attenuated the cytotoxic effect of glutamate. Compared to glutamate-injured astrocytes, pre-treatment with 100, 200 and 300 ng/ml TRF significantly improved cell viability following glutamate injury to 86.6%, 86.7% and 93.9%, respectively (p < 0.05). On the contrary, high concentrations of α-tocopherol promote cell death. This study shows that TRF not only provide a better protection against glutamate toxicity (pre-treatment), but was also able to reverse the lipid peroxidation resulting from glutamate insults (post-treatment). The present results demonstrate that TRF, but not α-tocopherol, protected the astrocytes against glutamate-induced cell death, indicating its neuro-protective potential.",

The effective moisture diffusivity of precooked taro slices was found in the range 3.55×10−9 to 6.84×10−9 m2/s. The flour from taro slices, cooked in lemon solution had lowest antinutritional factors and better color but comparatively inferior functional properties.

While the proteome of the MFGM in bovine milk has been extensively characterized, knowledge of these proteins in buffalo milk is limited. In this study, a proteomic approach was used to characterize the proteome of the buffalo MFGM. Multiple extraction techniques were used to increase the number of proteins identified, while label free relative quantitative liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used for comparison between the buffalo and bovine MFGM proteomes. A total of 220 buffalo MFGM proteins and 234 bovine MFGM proteins were identified after being filtered from the initial dataset of 757 and 680 proteins, respectively. A sixfold higher concentration of xanthine oxidoreductase was identified per mass of buffalo MFGM protein extracted, together with significantly greater concentrations of platelet glycoprotein 4, heat shock cognate and calcineurin B homologous protein. The expression of xanthine oxidoreductase in the MFGM of buffalo milk, which can affect milk shelf-life and flavor, was confirmed by Western blot analysis and a heterogeneous distribution of this protein observed in situ on the surface of the MFGM. The high concentration of fat in buffalo milk, together with the differences in the MFGM proteome provide insights into the differences in nutritional profile, biological function and properties of these two milk products.",

Quercetin-loaded liposome dispersions presented a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 264 nm and a zeta potential of −17 mV, which is typical for small unilamellar vesicles produced by ethanol injection. Sucrose was used as the lyoprotectant (mass sucrose: phospholipid ratio, 4:1), and the encapsulated quercetin had not degraded after 100 days of storage.

Cross-linking with RT, CA and GP could markedly affect the color of the modified PPP. The freeze-dried modified PPP with RT exhibited the lowest free amino group contents while using CA and GP exhibited the lowest sulfhydryl group contents. The spray-dried modified PPP with RT had lower free amino group contents than CA and GP. Modification of PPP changed the molecular weight and FT-IR spectra of both freeze-dried and spray-dried samples. The scanning electron microscope images showed that all spray-dried modified PPP samples exhibited shrinkage with a spherical shape whereas freeze-dried modified PPP exhibited a rough, grainy surface.

Samples of mature fruits were extracted with ethanol and the observed biological activities were dependent of the species and concentration as well. Araçás were the strongest α-glucosidase inhibitors (IC50 value of 25.4 ± 0.7 and 31.8 ± 0.7 µg/ml, respectively). Pitangas showed antiradical activities against DPPH, hydroxyl and nitric oxide radicals. Orange pitanga and butiá from Santa Vitória do Palmar were the most active concerning anion superoxide radical. All fruits are rich in total phenolic compounds with values in the range of 454.5 ± 17.3–908.3 ± 60.8 mg of equivalents of chlorogenic acid/100 g fresh weight. Purple pitanga stood out due to their levels of anthocyanins and carotenoids. Fruits showed similar amounts of total sugars, araçás and pitangas showed higher levels of reducing sugars while butiás were the richest ones in non-reducing sugars. Fruits with lower IC50 values for α-glucosidase inhibition were correlated with higher concentrations of reducing sugars, phenolic compounds, anthocyanins and carotenoids and grouped by principal component analysis (PCA). The obtained results indicate that these native fruits are promising sources of α-glucosidase inhibitors and antioxidants that can be used to control glycemia in patients with type 2 Diabetes mellitus.",

It has been used since ages in food applications as thickening, binding, sweetening and emulsifying agent. It has been known as part of the main staples for few countries as well. The abundant production of starch has a bright future in sustainable food supply to the world. However, starch appeared to have some limitations of structural stability under extreme conditions of pH and shear. Besides, starch pasting and retrogradation properties are also resist its deliberate use in food products. Thus, blending with non-starch hydrocolloid gums is one of the ways to manipulate starch properties. Non-starch hydrocolloid gums are high molecular weight polymers, usually polysaccharides, which interact with starch and impart desired functionality to the resultant blend for oriented application. In this review, we summarized a number of studies regarding the properties and applications of starch mixture with non-starch hydrocolloids such as arabic gum, guar gum, xanthan gum, locust bean gum, gellan and pectin. Further, the interaction mechanism of starch with non-starch hydrocolloid and their applications in cereal based foods are also enlisted. Thus, the aim of this review is to provide data of some basic applications and recent usage trends of starch/ non-starch hydrocolloid blends in foods.",

It is revealed that sprouts possess higher vitamins, antioxidant, flavonoids and fiber than grains. For evaluation of the potential prebiotic activity of rye sprout extract (RSE), the grains were soaked in water, germinated and dried by a freeze-dryer. The in-vitro viability and relative growth ratio (RGR) of probiotic bacteria, as well as their antimicrobial activities and their retention in synbiotic yogurt during 56 days cold storage in presence of RSE, were investigated. The sensory properties (odor, color, texture, taste and overall acceptance) of symbiotic yogurt with different amounts of RSE in comparison with control group were evaluated. The results showed that adding various concentrations of RSE increased the viability of both Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis (p<0.05), although this increase in B. animalis was better than L. acidophilus. Comparison of RGR of treated samples indicated that adding RSE even 0.25% can increase the growth and survival of probiotic in comparison with control. The results also showed that adding of RSE promoted the antimicrobial activities of probiotics. In synbiotic yogurt, probiotic populations remained higher than the minimum recommended therapeutic dose for an extended period of cold storage. There was no significant difference between sensory parameters of control specimens and synbiotic yogurt. According to our results, the synbiotic effect of RSE and probiotics highlights the potential application of RSE as a prebiotic in dairy and other functional products.",

Jerky slices were dried at 65 °C, 75 °C and 85 °C in a hot air oven and changes in mass were recorded every hour. Drying of jerky took place in falling rate period and drying rate was accelerated on reducing sodium chloride content and increasing air temperature. Moisture diffusivity and activation energy increased on bringing down the NaCl level from 2% to 1% in the samples, but addition of Potassium chloride (1%) to low sodium jerky helped to attain values for these parameters closer to those of control (2% NaCl). The variations of moisture ratio with time were used to test nine thin layer drying models given in literature in order to find the model that could best describe mathematically the drying behaviour of chicken jerky. Logarithmic model was found to be most suitable to represent chicken jerky drying kinetics (for all treatments) with a very high correlation coefficient value of 0.99 and low chi-square and root mean square error values. As far as physical properties were concerned reducing NaCl content led to increase in L* values (hunter colour parameter for lightness), % shrinkage and shear force values. These changes were to a great extent diminished by the addition of potassium chloride, hence, making it a suitable sodium chloride replacement strategy.",

Besides, total phenolic contents and DPPH radical scavenging activities of the methanolic extract of A. biebersteinii at different phenological stage including vegetative, floral budding, full flowering (leaves, stem and flowers) and fruit set were assessed for the first time. Variation in total phenolic content and free radical scavenging activities can explained by changes occurred in biological activities and consequently chemical composition of plant throughout the developmental stages. There was a significant correlation between phenolic content and free radical scavenging. The extract of floral budding stage which contained highest phenolic content (113.34 mg GAE/g DW) showed potent free radical scavenging activity (IC50=4.64 µg/ml), and stem extract which have lowest amount of total phenol demonstrated to have weakest IC50 value. As regards the results mentioned above, A. biebersteinii can be applied to the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical purposes for its acceptable antioxidant and antifungal properties.",

A strong correlation was observed for AA and TPC (R2=0.98) at all the stages of digestion. The principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the increase in AA in pineapple juice was more related with the phase of digestion, with the highest increase of AA after gastric (4.5 fold) and intestinal (21.0 fold) phases.

The SFC as a function of temperature (SFCf(T)) or saturated fatty acids (SFCf(SFA)) curves, and SMP as a function of SFA (SMPf(SFA)) curve had sigmoidal shapes and all the sigmoidal functions were able to describe the SFC and SMP curves.

The Gompertz function could describe the SMPf(SFA) curves with high R2 (0.99) and low MAE (0.65 °C). In addition, the obtained model could describe the SMP of interesterified palm olein-based fat blends with MAE lower than 3.1 °C.

Shark catfish skin collagen films were formed using different cross-linking agents such as sorbitol, glycerol, glutaraldehyde (GTA), Hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDC), transglutaminase (TG) and k-carageenan (kCGN). Their mechanical and functional properties were studied. Tensile strength (TS) and stiffness were high in collagen-transglutaminase (collagen-TG) films (6.40 and 325 MPa, respectively), whereas elongation and swelling rate were high in collagen-sorbitol films (18.0% and 9.60%, respectively). Water solubility was high in simple collagen films (67.0%), and low in collagen-glutaraldehyde films (6.40%). FTIR spectra showed that the interaction of collagen with different cross-linking agents influenced the amide peaks absorption patterns. Collagen films made with TG had smooth and compact surfaces, while those with kCGN had rough surface in SEM analysis. In vitro biodegradation showed that all the collagen films were degraded rapidly within 4 days, except the collagen-TG films that degraded on day 6. Accordingly, collagen-TG films with high strength, solubility and stability were the best among those studied. Further work is needed to determine potential food and biomedical applications of these films.",

As for the mechanical properties, Young's modulus and elongation at break were not affected significantly by incorporation of 1–3% MO (p>0.05). As for the tensile strength, fish gelatin film incorporated with 1–3% MO showed a higher value than control (p≤0.05). The opacity between the samples and control varied statistically with the highest value with films containing 3% oil (p≤0.05). However, increasing the MO concentrations would decrease the water vapor permeability (p>0.05). DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) was used to determine the antioxidant activity and the result increased significantly (p≤0.05) from 9% to 16% with the increase of oil concentration, suggesting MO incorporation in films as potential means of active packaging.",

     "abstract": "The effect of composition, hydrogenation of phospholipids and lyophilization on liposomes characteristics was investigated. Liposomes were produced by ethanol injection method, employing hydrogenated (Phospholipon 80H, Phospholipon 90H) or non-hydrogenated soybean phosphatidylcholine (Lipoid S100) with cholesterol. Using Phospholipon 80H, cholesterol addition was crucial for liposomal homogeneity. Phospholipids concentration, stirring rate, and ethanol/water volume ratio were the most determinant factors controlling the vesicles size. Phospholipid assays showed that saturated phospholipids resulted in higher incorporation in vesicles than unsaturated ones. Smaller vesicles were obtained with Phospholipon 80H, due to lower content of phosphatidylcholine and to the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine which might increase repulsion between phospholipids, resulting in an increase in Zeta-potential and a decrease in vesicle size. TEM images revealed nanometric sized and spherical shaped oligo-lamellar vesicles. Although Lipoid S100 liposomes possessed the highest encapsulation efficiency of eugenol (86.6%), they were not stable in aqueous suspension at 4 °C after 2 months of storage, limiting their use in freeze-drying. Among several cryoprotectants, hydroxylpropyl-β-cyclodextrin protected eugenol-loaded Phospholipon 90H liposomes during freeze-drying as the mean vesicle size, polydispersity index, Zeta potential and encapsulation efficiency of eugenol were similar before and after lyophilization. This study demonstrated the possibility of maintaining a volatile essential oil in a suitable lyophilized liposomal formulation despite the very low applied pressures.",

In this study, ten different solvents, including water, aqueous methanol, aqueous ethanol and aqueous acetone were used to investigate the effect of solvents on the recovery and antioxidant activities of polyphenols from sweet potato leaves. Results indicated that the total phenolic content in extracts ranged from 23.3 to 43.8 mg CAE/g DM, and 70% ethanol extract had the highest total flavonoid (3.4 mg QE/g DM) and total anthocyanin (36.5 mg c-3-gE/100 g DM) content. While, 50% acetone extract exhibited the highest crude extract yield (33.4% in dry materials), total phenolic content (43.8 mg CAE/g DM), as well as the strongest in vitro antioxidant activities. The best correlation with antioxidant activities was observed on total phenolics. Totally 14 phenolics were identified or tentatively identified in 50% acetone extract, caffeoylquinic acid (CQA) and quercetin derivatives were indicated as the most abundant phenolics. HPLC analysis also revealed that the extraction efficiency of 3-CQA, caffeic acid, 3,4-, 3,5- and 4,5-diCQA varied with the polarity of tested solvent, and 70% acetone showed the highest extraction capacity for 3,4-, 3,5- and 4,5-diCQA.

The physicochemical characterizations such as color parameters, browning index (BI), pH, viscosity, diastase activity, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) content and antioxidative properties affected by processing treatments were determined. Our results illustrated that both thermal and ultrasonic processes sufficiently eliminated the indicator microbes to the complied limits of the Thai Agricultural Standard (TAS 8003-2013). Based on the results, the color, BI, pH, diastase activity and HMF content of ultrasonicated honeys were minimally altered. Ultrasonication yielded higher quality of antioxidant compounds and properties as compared to the conventional thermal technique. Additionally, ultrasound treatment at 40% amplitude noticeably improved the levels of total phenols, total flavonoids and antioxidant capacity (FRAP assay). Thus, ultrasonication, especially with low amplification, is an alternative preservation technique for maintaining the quality of honey samples.",

Functional properties and in vitro inhibitory effect of the resulting protein hydrolysates on Dipeptidyl Peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) and Prolyloligopeptidase (PO) were evaluated. After hydrolysis, more than 73% of protein was recovered in soluble form, whereas 11–15% was insoluble. Carotenoids, determined as astaxanthin, were mainly present (>97%) in the insoluble protein fraction, presumably in form of complexes of high molecular weight. Protein hydrolysates showed excellent solubility (>97%) in a wide pH range (3–10), good oil holding capacity (0.86–1.83 g oil/g hydrolysates) and discrete inter-facial properties. Besides, all shrimp hydrolysates at concentration of 1 mg/mL provided DPP-IV inhibition activity (22.7–61.7%) and those prepared with trypsin and Alcalase® also inhibited PO (35–40% inhibition).

Most of the bioactive molecules of cereal residues in their bran portion and hence their bioavailabilities are governed by the processing step. It is well accepted that grain processing followed by polishing has negative impacts on nutritional properties of cereal. Use of cell wall degrading enzymes for mobilization of bioactive molecules in bran layer of grain is opening up a new avenue for grain enrichment.

     "abstract": "This work represents the final step of a series of studies on the formulation of strawberry products with partial replacement of sucrose by healthier sugars such as fructose and isomaltulose. Previously, quality parameters of the formulated products such as colour, texture, rheology, aromatic profile and sensory evaluation were assessed. As a final step, in the present work, the volatile profile evolution of a strawberry spread-product during 90 days of storage at room temperature (20 °C), and its relation with some physicochemical properties (aw, pH, texture and colour) and antioxidant activity as well as anthocyanin content were studied.Most of the volatile compounds modified their concentration during storage; some of them totally disappeared but 13 new compounds were formed: (methyl-2-methyl butyrate, E-2-butenal, 2-butenal-2-methyl, 2-buten-1-ol, 2-penten-1-ol, 2-etil-1-hexanol, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, acetic acid, propanoic-2-methyl acid, butyric acid and butyric-2-methyl acid). Storage led to a dark pink colour and an increase in consistency and adhesiveness while the antioxidant activity considerably increased (from 18±2% to 94±2% DPPH inhibition).Levels of citric acid and pectin influenced colour, texture and antioxidant activity as well as retention and formation of aromatic compounds, especially in fructose–isomaltulose products. Correlations via a PLS were found between the aromatic profile of the products after storage and some of their quality parameters such as texture, colour and antioxidant content. Future research might involve correlation and identification of specific volatiles with different quality parameters.",

Accordingly, a membrane dialysis process was used to simulate gastrointestinal conditions in order to assess the potential bioaccessibility of mineral elements in different preparations of Achillea millefolium (yarrow), Laurus nobilis (laurel) and Taraxacum sect.

Dandelion showed the highest levels of all studied mineral elements (except zinc) independently of the used formulations (dried plant or infusion), but yarrow was the only species yielding minerals after the dialysis step, either in dried form, or as infusion. In fact, the ability of each evaluated element to cross the dialysis membrane showed significant differences, being also highly dependent on the plant species.

An experimental design was initially performed in order determine the best extraction conditions on yield of TPC from stevia leaves. The encapsulation of the optimised extract was conducted through extrusion technology. Wet and lyophilised calcium alginate beads were examined and compared in relation to their TPC and entrapment efficiency based on the effects caused by storage conditions. High encapsulation efficiency values were obtained for the wet (69.8%) and for the lyophilised (97.7%) beads stored in the optimised extract. A high correlation was observed between the TPC of the optimised extract and its antioxidant activity values, determined in terms of the ability to scavenge free radicals and its ferric reducing ability (r=0.99 and 0.97, p<0.001, respectively). Lyophilisation significantly affected bead size and morphology and proved to be an appropriate method for preservation of encapsulated polyphenols. Confocal microscopy images showed that both the wet and the lyophilised beads exhibited an intense red fluorescence emission attributed to the phenolic constituents. Release of encapsulated polyphenols in water was measured to analyse the diffusion and kinetic behaviour of the system. Both the wet and the lyophilised beads showed stability in TPC and preserved antioxidant potential throughout 30 days of storage at 4 °C. Thus, encapsulation of stevia extracts in alginate beads is a promising technique for food supplementation with natural antioxidants.",

     "abstract": "Not only, strawberry fruits have a very short shelf life, but also their bioactive substances were declined during postharvest. This study is aimed at determining the efficacy of edible coating enrichment with olive wastes polyphenols based chitosan on components of cold-stored strawberry fruits. Fruits were sprayed with five different coating formulas compared to water wax incorporated with thiabendazole (WW-TBZ) and uncoated fruits served as control. Then, some freshness parameters, decay area and microstructure observation were assayed. Indeed, the losses of each parameter in uncoated fruits were extremely rapid compared with coated fruits. Conversely, malondialdehyde and decay area significantly increased in uncoated fruits compared with coated fruits. Amazingly, the addendum of olive leaves extract into chitosan coating was expressively reduced the gradual decline in total phenolics, flavonoids, antioxidants, ascorbic acid and malondialdehyde. Whereas, olive pomace extract recorded the lowest influencing on anthocyanins during storage at 4±1 °C for 16 day. In addition, both olive wastes extracts significantly enhanced the bioactive substances compared with WW-TBZ. Then, fruits coated with chitosan incorporation coating solution showed uniform coating distribution and no pores were found. Thus, olive wastes extracts integration into chitosan based coating led to keep the bioactive substances of cold-stored strawberry fruits.",

     "abstract": "Drying is an important process parameter for preservation of food components and it is widely applicable in food sectors. Nowadays, encapsulation by drying technology is of growing interest to provide many useful effects in food industry. Encapsulation of several drying techniques (spray drying, freeze drying, and fluidized bed coating) is a challenge to incorporate food component, antioxidant, colorant, cells and enzymes in powder form in food products. By drying, encapsulation achieves excellent properties of protection, stabilization, solubility and controlled release of the bioactive compounds. There are many reasons to apply encapsulation technology by drying, so recent developments of encapsulation are discussed in this review. Controlled release of food component at the right place at right time is a key functionality that can be provided by encapsulation. Drying improves effectiveness of food additives, broadens the application range of food ingredients, enhances shelf life of the food and lowers cost of the food products.",

The Halsey equation was further used to estimate the thermodynamic functions that provide an understanding of the properties of water and energy requirements associated with the sorption behavior. The differential enthalpy and entropy decreased with increasing moisture content. Through the compensatory theory, it was found that the isokinetic temperature was greater than the harmonic mean temperature, indicating that the adsorption process was controlled by the enthalpy and was not spontaneous (ΔG>0). With respect to the integral properties, the integral enthalpy values decreased with increasing moisture content, while the integral entropy had opposite behavior. The integral entropy values were negative due to the existence of a chemical adsorption and/or changes in the structure of the adsorbent.",

Anti-inflammatory effect of flavanone derivatives was studied by suppressive activity on NO synthesis from LPS-stimulated macrophages cells. 3′,4′-Dimethoxyflavanone, 5-methoxyflavanone, and 5-methoxy-4′-chloroflavanone showed the potent inhibitory activity on nitrite production. Addition of the methoxy group at 5′-position and 3′,4′-position of flavanone showed a high inhibitory activity of NO production from LPS-macrophage cells, which is one of the typical anti-inflammatory biomarkers. Taken together, the location of the methoxy group in a flavanone structure might have some connection with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.",

Concentrations of 5, 10, 15, and 20 ppm of each compound were evaluated by a broth micro-dilution method and the MICs were determined by using optical density after 24 and 60 h of incubation. Structural alterations in treated bacteria were observed via scanning electron microscopy.For E. coli, thymoquinone showed the highest inhibition, followed by rutin, (−) epicatechin and myricetin (MIC<20 ppm for all), while Salmonella was most sensitive to (−) epicatechin (MIC<15 ppm), followed by thymoquinone, rutin and myricetin (MIC<20 ppm for all) following 60 h of incubation. The results demonstrated that the PCs have varying antimicrobial activities against foodborne pathogens following 24 and 60 h incubation periods. Natural sources of PCs contain major antibacterial components and have great potential to be used as natural antimicrobials and food preservatives, during long term storage.This study highlighted the antimicrobial efficacy of some novel PCs which may replace chemical antimicrobials and preservatives in food or pharmaceutical industry to partially or completely inhibit the growth of bacteria.",

The input neurons included incubation period of 6–18 days, pH of rice water as substrate (3.0–5.0) and concentration of ammonium nitrate as nitrogen source (0.0–2.0%). The model was trained and validated to predict the red pigment yield (abs500 nm/mg dry fungal biomass). The results showed a good fit between predicted and experimental values for the model. The maximum red pigment yield (20.44 U abs500 nm/mg dfb) was obtained with substrate pH of 4.0 without any ammonium nitrate as N-source after 12 days of incubation.

Moreover, chestnuts from Zhejiang province (south) had the highest polyphenol content and those from Hunan province had the highest flavonoid content. Owing to their high sugar content, Hunan chestnuts were the sweetest. However, principal component analysis indicated that factors other than geographic regions also contributed to compositional and quality variations, indicating the necessity for further investigations.",

The enzyme was active toward α-chain moiety of human fibrin and Aα and Bβ chains of fibrinogen and was termed as CFR11-protease. With the specific activity of 1399.57 U/mg of protein, maximum activity of enzyme was observed at pH 7.4 and temperature of 50 °C. Divalent cations Mg2+ and Mn2+ were found to enhance protease activity but it was inhibited by phenyle methyl sulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) and ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA). From the data obtained, the enzyme had an apparent molecular weight of 190 kDa as per SDS-PAGE analysis and zymography. The in-vitro Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) and Prothrombin Time (PT) values showed no significant difference in both dose and time-dependent assay, inferring the safer property of the CFR11 enzyme for thrombolytic purpose.

This review covers the recent significant materials found in the literature on palm oil processing, refining, and use in frying especially in blends with other vegetable oils. Crude palm oil (CPO) is obtained from the fruit of the oil palm tree (Elaeis guineensis). The oil is rich in palmitic acid, β-carotene and vitamin E. CPO has been fractionated mainly into liquid palm olein and solid palm stearin in order to diversify its food applications. Palm oil is highly stable during frying especially due to the synergistic activity of β-carotene and tocotrienol. In recent years there has been a shift from the use of animal fats and hydrogenated vegetable oils in frying and other food applications. The use of naturally stable oils such as palm oil and composite oils like blends of palm oil and other fats and oils is practiced to ensure that maximum benefits are derived from the oils. Blending offers functional, nutritional and technical advantages, such as tailoring the oil to suit frying applications.

One of the major biological control methods is found in the use of fungal cell wall-degrading enzymes such as chitinases, which hydrolyze the homopolymer of β-1,4-1inked N-acetylglucosamine residues exposed on the fungal cell surface. In this study, antagonistic effects of the chitinolytic enzyme producing isolates of Pseudomonas fluorescens PB27, Bacillus cereus B1 and Bacillus thuringiensis K1 against the aflatoxigenic fungus Aspergillus flavus were investigated. Germination of the spores of A. flavus was inhibited by up to nearly 20% after co-incubation with P. fluorescens PB27 for 72 h, whereas the fungal spores were less affected when incubated with either B. cereus B1 or B. thuringiensis K1. When P. fluorescens or its extracted extracellular enzyme preparation was sprayed on the surface of hazelnuts, the growth of A. flavus was reduced nearly 25%. Scanning electron microscopy observations of hyphae and spores revealed that these enzymes induce numerous ultrastructural morphological changes during spore germination and mycelium growth. Since chitinolytic enzymes have not been shown to be toxic to humans or the environment, based on the observations in this study, an understanding of the functional properties and antagonistic effect of this natural antifungal agent can be practical in the management of post-harvest losses caused by food pathogenic and aflatoxin producing fungi.",

     "abstract": "Papaya fruit is highly perishable resulting in around 25% postharvest losses which is further enhanced during storage and transportation. To prevent these losses intermediate moisture (IM) papaya cubes were developed using a novel combination technology including osmotic dehydration, blanching and infrared drying. These cubes were further hygienized by exposing to gamma radiation dose of 2 kGy. The final processed product could be stored up to 60 days at ambient temperature, whereas, the unprocessed freshly cut samples spoiled within 2 days. Nutritional analysis of IM cubes indicated nearly 5 fold increase in calorie value with significant increase in the per unit dry weight content of carbohydrate, protein, fibre, and functional bioactives such as ascorbic acid, carotenoids, and phenolics including flavonoids. The activity of oxidising enzymes, polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase, was reduced by 88 and 96%, respectively in IM papaya cubes. The functional properties in terms of antioxidant capacity and antimutagenic potential were improved. The processing ensured the microbiological safety of the product. Organoleptically the product was found to be well acceptable by the taste panellists. The findings thus could help reduce postharvest losses in papaya by providing a technology to make ready-to-eat (RTE) nutrient rich product.",

By using a full factorial and central composite design, it was possible to correlate the output parameters such as the Redox potential, temperature, voltage and pH with the input parameters (type of salt in the central compartment; maple juice concentration, electrical current intensity, and the mechanical stirring given by the Froude number). To decrease the maple juice pH in the anodic compartment, the optimization of these parameters showed that a juice concentration of 6%, treated at 300 mA, with a Froude number of 2.05×10−3 was the best treatment. The maximum difference between the pH given by the second degree model and that of each test is 8%, which indicates that this model equation of second order adequately describes the targeted kinetic.",

Shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) were reared on standard feed, as control (CS), and on feed supplemented with the algae Haematococcus pluvialis as a carotenoid source (SS). Total carotenoids extracted from shrimp muscle were compared for in vitro antioxidant activity through a thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay, free radical scavenging activity 2,2-diphenil-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and the co-oxidation of β-carotene/linoleic acid. In addition, the ability of total carotenoids in preventing in vitro lipid peroxidation in the serum and liver of rats was evaluated. The results were compared with synthetic astaxanthin. Supplemented shrimp had higher content of astaxanthin than the CS group (4.55 mg/kg vs. 2.82 mg/kg of shrimp). Total carotenoids of the CS group presented a concentration-dependent antioxidant activity, that was similar to the synthetic astaxanthin, while total carotenoids of the CS showed lower antioxidant ability (P<0.05). Basically, shrimp total carotenoids were able to prevent the in vitro rat serum and liver lipid peroxidation, and scavengers the DPPH. The results suggest that astaxanthin, the major carotenoid present in shrimp, may have a protective antioxidant effect in the crustacean. The beneficial effects of the consumption of food containing astaxanthin as the major carotenoid seem apparent. Further in vivo studies are required.",

Results showed date fruit bars to be rich in protein, fat and carbohydrates with good energy values. However, decrease in total phenolics and inhibition of DPPH radical was observed in fruit bars compared to raw dates. Texture wise, products had high fracturability, indicating easy to bite and chew nature, thus rendering it suitable for elderly people and small children. Results of sensory quality evaluation indicated dates to have excellent potential to be converted into fruit bars. Results generated in this study suggest date-based fruit bars may be expected to fulfill the requirements of health conscious consumers.

Some of the edible fruits ripen within a very short period, usually leading to an overabundance of the fruits when harvested. Many of the fruits are consumed fresh, but large quantities of harvested fruits are wasted during peak harvest periods, due to the high temperature and humidity, poor handling, poor storage facilities and microbial infections. Therefore, winemaking from such ripe fruits or their juices is considered as an alternative of utilizing surplus and over-ripe fruits for generating additional revenues for the fruit growers. This review summarizes current knowledge about the usage of fruits other than grapes for winemaking and elaborates their properties; mainly quality, consumption, nutrition, sensory evaluation and health benefits. Hence, production and commercialization of non-grape fruit wines is the basis for the standardization of technologies for reducing post-harvest losses and contributes to the economy of the existing wine industry.",

Honey displayed strong anti-proliferative property against different cancer cell lines (myeloid leukemia, breast and lung cancer) but did not affect normal cell line (Int-407, intestinal epithelial cell) indicating its differential and selective cytotoxicity. The efficacy of protection against radiation induced oxidative damage was evaluated for plasmid DNA and also bacterial cells. Honey displayed protection to supercoiled form of plasmid DNA at comparatively lower dose of 0.15 kGy and reduced the extent of strand breaks at a higher dose of 1 kGy. Besides, honey also protected the functionality of plasmid DNA which was scored in terms of its transformation efficiency. Honey too protected E. coli cells from the radiation induced oxidative damage and D10 in the presence of honey increased by ~5 fold (0.1 to 0.49 kGy).

The impact of supplementing breads at a 10% level with non-malted and malted yellow pea flour was studied. Microbiological monitoring was performed throughout the malting process. Fine flours were processed and characterized for their fineness, protein content and ash content. Dough mixing properties were determined prior to bread preparation. Results showed that malting process slightly increased the protein content and changed the microbiological profile of yellow peas; the highest density in population was achieved by psychrophilic bacteria and the occurrence of Enterobacteriaceae considerably increased. Dough mixing properties of yellow pea flours were barely affected by the malting process leading to a promising bread-making potential when compared to un-substituted flour.",

Synergistic effects between the formulations containing binary or ternary mixtures were observed for several parameters. For functional properties, the enzymatic hydrolysis increased protein solubility except for EWP and its mixtures. However the hydrolysates exhibited a tendency to decrease their foaming capacities and heat stability. A synergistic effect was found for the emulsion activity index of two binary formulations and the ternary mixture, with increases of up to 155.2%. The hydrolyzed samples positively stimulated the bacteria growth.

Results show that the combination of 30% isomaltulose and 70% fructose in the total amount of sugars would be suitable for developing functional gummy confections. Besides its stability (aw (0.79±0.02) and °Brix (73.5±1.3)) and great similarity to commercial gummies in terms of optical and mechanical properties, it received high global acceptability and intention of buying scores.

The binary mixtures of SFO and PO in RFO were infrared spectroscopically scanned using horizontal attenuated total reflectance at mid infrared region (4000–650 cm−1). Some frequency regions where the variations were observed among RFO, SFO, and PO were optimized in order to seek the best frequency regions giving the best PLS calibration models. Besides, the derivatization of FTIR spectra (fisrt and second derivatives) was also investigated in order to look the types of FTIR spectra giving the best spectral performance in the model. The results showed that SFO was better determined using FTIR normal spectra at the frequency region of 1200–1000 cm−1 with coefficient of determination (R2) of >0.99 and with root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) of 1.42% v/v. FTIR normal spectra were also more preferred than its derivative for the quantification of PO in RFO. The R2 value obtained for the relationship between actual value (reference value) and predicted value obtained during PLS modeling is very high (0.9991) with the low level of error (RMSEC of 0.98% v/v). It can be concluded that FTIR in combination with PLS is a reliable method for quantitative analysis of SFO and PO as adulterant in RFO for authenticity verification.",

Furthermore, it is known that both the method of drying and the temperature at which this process takes place substantially affect the properties of the final product. However, there are no studies in the literature that examine how drying variables can affect the quality of persimmon leaves, especially as refers to preservation of their antioxidant properties. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to compare some antioxidant properties of aqueous extracts of persimmon leaves obtained under different drying methods (shade drying, hot air drying at 100 and 180 °C, and freeze drying) and infusion conditions (70, 80 and 90 °C for 1, 3, 5, 60 and 1440 min). The results in terms of total phenol content, flavonoids and antioxidant capacity indicated that air drying at 100 °C would be the optimal process for the stabilization of persimmon leaves, and their subsequent use in brewed beverages. Likewise, the best conditions of aqueous extraction in order to maximize the extractability of antioxidant compounds corresponded to 90 °C for 60 min. A short experiment performed in this study confirmed that small persimmon leaves (axial axis: 9±1 (cm); equatorial axis: 7.0±0.9 (cm)) had around 9% more flavonoids, and 7% more total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity than the large ones (axial axis: 17±2 (cm); equatorial axis: 10±1 (cm)).",

Antityrosinase and antibacterial properties were determined using the respective modified dopachrome method and disc-diffusion method. The outstanding AOP of fresh cashew leaves far exceeded those of betel leaves, including temperate culinary herbs of rosemary, thyme and marjoram. Blanching resulted in a significant decline in AOP of cashew and betel leaves with leaching of phenolic compounds into the blanching water. AOP of microwave-treated leaves of cashew remained unchanged but leaves of betel exhibited significant increase. Tyrosinase inhibition of fresh cashew leaves was high while betel leaves exhibited an enhancement of tyrosinase activities. Blanching did not affect the tyrosinase inhibition of cashew leaves but microwave treatment resulted in significant increase. For betel leaves, tyrosinase inhibition remained unchanged. Results showed that fresh cashew and betel leaves inhibited both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria tested.

Xanthan gum had high capability in emulsifying and foaming properties and just loosed its foaming capacity after cooling. Emulsifying and foaming properties of cress seed gum also were considerable, which were maintained after cooling treatments.

Principal Component Analysis reduced the 10 original analytical and proximate variables (TSS, total sugar, TA, pH, phenol, β-carotene, ascorbic acid, lactic acid, ethanol and DPPH scavenging activity) into three independent components which accounted for 80.78% variation. Sensory evaluation was carried out by 16 selected panelists on various attributes such as taste, aroma, flavor, color/appearance and after taste. The results showed that the bael wine was very much liked by the panelists and there was no significant difference between the two sets (p<0.05) in most sensory parameters. Wine prepared from bael fruit pulp is a novel beverage rich in anti-oxidants with an alcoholic concentration of 7.87% (v/v). There is a good prospect for commercialization of this wine as a medicinal wine.",

The suitable physical form of FOS that confers the intended functionality in the biscuit matrix was also determined. It was observed that the retention of FOS increased with their increasing initial levels. At higher levels, FOS affected texture of biscuits due to disruption of gluten matrix as confirmed by the microstructure analysis.

Whiteness of both kamaboko and modori gels increased with increasing levels of zinc salts (P<0.05). Salt bridge and ionic interactions played a major role in cross-linking of proteins. Kamaboko gel had highly interconnected, denser and finer network with smaller voids when zinc salts, especially ZnSO4 at 60 µmol/kg, was incorporated. Therefore, ZnSO4 at an appropriate level could improve gel strength and whiteness of surimi from dark fleshed fish.",

Thus, 96.94% basil seed gum and 3.06% guar gum and 0%, 0.01% or 0.02% κ-carrageenan were included as stabilizer. Melting rate of ice creams increased with storage, but addition of κ-carrageenan had no significant impact on this factor. Storage time augmented the hardness of ice creams, which varied from 1087.0 to 5497.3 g. Good correlations between some instrumental and sensory properties of samples, such as iciness and coarseness in scoop with instrumental hardness, were established. Although storage time could deteriorate some textural attributes of ice creams, selected stabilizers succeed to reduce these defects and improve the quality of samples. These findings support the idea of suitable stabilizing effect of these ingredients. Presence of κ-carrageenan found to be a crucial factor for this cryo-protection.",

Pasteurized Dooghs containing fiber and gellan with constant shear rates had higher shear stresses and apparent viscosities than non-pasteurized samples. Moreover, pasteurization of the Dooghs led to an increase in the consistency coefficient and a decrease in the flow behavior index as well as an increase in the plastic viscosity and yield stress. The heat-treatment of the Dooghs resulted in a more pseudo-plastic behavior. The new products were stable during storage; however, about 55% phase separation occurred in control samples.

Optimization of the composition of the coating solution was done such as to obtain maximum strength and antimicrobial efficacy of the paper. The inhibitory effect of sodium permanganate on growth of Candida pelliculosa (58%) was most evident, however it had a weakening effect on the physical strength of paper (tensile strength, percent stretch, tensile energy absorption and stiffness). Potassium sorbate exhibited lesser deleterious effect on the physical strength parameters while decreasing growth of C. pelliculosa and Kloeckera apis (>18.8%). Paper coated with optimized combination of chemicals (degree of desirability: 0.835) was tested for its effect on the physicochemical changes of climacteric fruits like peach and plum during storage at room temperature (32±2 °C). Physiological changes were much less in active wrapped fruits after six days of storage as compared to unwrapped fruits. This was especially notable in case of puncture resistance (85% increase) and total soluble solids (4±1° Brix increase) in control fruits, compared to 64% and 1° Brix increase respectively, in active wrapped fruits.

In this study, sourdough cultures derived from wheat, the conventional source of sourdough starter, and apple, an alternative source of non-cereal yeasts were tested for their gas production over time with a Risograph fermentation gas measuring device. Sourdough starter, levain, and bread dough derived from the apple culture significantly out-performed the wheat-derived cultures in CO2 gas production at every stage of culture elaboration and fermentation. The apple-derived culture produced about twice the fermentation gas of the wheat-derived culture in the bread dough.

We found that both flavonoids significantly increased cell viability, either in presence or in absence of 17β-estradiol (E2). The proliferation effect was noticeably reduced by fulvestrant, an antiestrogen, and by LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway.

In the present study casein was separated from buffalo milk and was hydrolyzed with trypsin to form casein hydrolysates. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities of casein hydrolysates were measured and its effect on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation was studied. Casein hydrolysates at 50 and 250 µg/mL concentration stimulated the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts in vitro which was confirmed by MTT proliferation assay. Casein hydrolysates also increased calcium mineralization in osteoblast cells in comparison to control. Likewise, the expression of osteocalcin, osteoprotegerin and alkaline phosphatase genes which are known marker of osteoblast differentiation has also been significantly (P<0.05) increased in treatment groups as compared with the control.

Our results show that trans-resveratrol down-regulates Cav-1 and up-regulates eNOS in both endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, and that these alterations reduce the interaction of Cav-1 and eNOS in the vascular system. These effects could be beneficial in the treatment of several pathologies such as hypercholesterolemia, pulmonary hypertension, or atherosclerosis, which are characterized by decreased NO production and increased interaction of Cav-1 and eNOS.",

     "abstract": "Gel properties of threadfin bream (Nemipterus bleekeri) surimi added with fish gelatin at different levels (0–20% protein substitution) in combination with microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) at various concentrations (0–1.2 units g−1 surimi) were studied. Breaking force and deformation of surimi gel decreased when the levels of fish gelatin increased (p<0.05). When MTGase was incorporated, the increases in breaking force and deformation were obtained in surimi gel added with 0–15% fish gelatin. Nevertheless, the addition of MTGase at higher levels led to the decrease in both breaking force and deformation of surimi gel containing 20% fish gelatin (p<0.05). Addition of fish gelatin could lower the expressible moisture content of surimi gel. Band intensity of myosin heavy chain (MHC) and actin of surimi gel decreased when fish gelatin levels increased, mainly due to dilution effect. The coarser and irregular gel structure was obtained when fish gelatin was added. The addition of 1.2 units MTGase g−1 surimi decreased MHC in surimi gel containing fish gelatin slightly.",

     "abstract": "Polyphenolic extract of Blighia sapida arilli was evaluated for reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and detoxification potentials in rat microsomes. ROS scavenging potentials of the polyphenolic extract of B. sapida (0.2–1.0 mg/mL) was investigated using DPPH radical, superoxide anion radical, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical and ferric ion reducing system. The detoxification of ROS was evaluated in N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced redox imbalance in rat microsomes. B. sapida polyphenolic extract (1.0 mg/mL) scavenged DPPH, superoxide anion radical, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical by 60, 67, 63, and 57%, respectively, while ferric ion was significantly reduced. N-nitrosodiethylamine-mediated decrease in the activities of ROS detoxifying enzymes was significantly (P<0.05) attenuated. N-nitrosodiethylamine-mediated elevation in the concentrations of oxidative stress biomarkers: malondialdehyde, conjugated dienes, lipid hydroperoxides, protein carbonyl and percentage DNA fragmentation were significantly (P<0.05) lowered by B. sapida polyphenolic extract. Overall, the polyphenolic extract of B. sapida arilli elicited ROS scavenging and detoxification potentials and prevented lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and DNA fragmentation.",

Oral administration of ethanolic and aqueous extract of S. indicus to the paracetamol induced rats' showed increase of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant status and decreased lipid peroxide level. For proteomic approach, identified the four differential spots were expressed in paracetamol induced and S. indicus treated rats through 2D gel. The expressions of these protein spots were further confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS i.e. Heat shock protein, Liver transferrin, Glutathione-S-Transferase and Carnitine palmitoyl transferase. These identified proteins involved in many cellular activities like maintain cellular integrity, iron transport, free radical scavenging activity and β oxidation of fatty acids. These results were given more information about antioxidant activity of extracts. Therefore, the plant extracts could be used safely as food supplement for antioxidant activities enhancements.",

     "abstract": "Blackberries contain anthocyanins and phenolic acids derived from anthocyanin fragments that have an important role in the small intestine for retaining gut health. It has been hypothesized that supplementing diets with blackberries may improve gut health through a prebiotic mechanism. Unfortunately identification of gut bacteria is difficult since only 20% of bacterial species can be cultured using current techniques. Therefore, a non-culture based technique was utilized to examine shifts in gut bacteria of mice fed one of five diet treatments: (1) control, (2) aged blackberries supplemented at 5% (w/w), (3) aged blackberries supplemented at 10% (w/w), (4) fresh blackberries supplemented at 5% (w/w), and (5) fresh blackberries supplemented at 10% (w/w). Mice feces were initially collected before supplementing blackberries as a control (0 week) and were collected every 2 weeks for up to 10 weeks. Polymerase chain reaction-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-based DGGE) was performed and further identification of bacteria was conducted by excising and sequencing target bands. Banding patterns were more consistent over time in those groups that had a diet supplemented with 10% aged or fresh blackberries compared to the 2 groups fed a diet supplemented with 5% of fresh or aged blackberries. From the sequencing data, Lactobacillus johnsonii was present in all groups after 2 weeks of sampling. The Aerococcus spp. and Actinomycetes were increased in blackberries treatments as well as Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumonia and Erwinia spp. were present in aged blackberry treatment. These data indicate that supplementing a diet with aged or fresh blackberries causes shifts in the gastrointestinal microflora.",
