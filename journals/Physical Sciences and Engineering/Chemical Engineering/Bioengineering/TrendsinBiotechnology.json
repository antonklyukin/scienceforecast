One particular group of microorganisms that is fast becoming recognized for their commercial potential is cyanobacteria. Through the process of photosynthesis, cyanobacteria can use CO2 as a building block to synthesize carbon-based chemicals. In recent years, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-dependent approaches have rapidly gained popularity for engineering cyanobacteria. Such approaches permit markerless genome editing, simultaneous manipulation of multiple genes, and transcriptional regulation of genes. The drastically shortened timescale for mutant selection and segregation is especially advantageous for cyanobacterial work. In this review, we highlight studies that have implemented CRISPR-based tools for the metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria.",

Among the potential targets for cancer therapy is the tumor suppressor gene TP53, which is found in a mutated state in approximately 50% of human cancers and is often associated with poor prognosis. We propose a novel, highly tumor-specific delivery system for TP53, based on the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology. This system will restore the normal p53 phenotype in tumor cells by replacing the mutant TP53 gene with a functional copy, leading to sustained expression of p53 protein and tumor regression.",

Here, we introduce and propose tailor-made modifications to five types of mainstream bioanalytical methodologies. We specifically illustrate how these modifications can translate existing techniques for protein analysis into competent tools for dissecting the composition, bioactivity, and interaction (with both nanomaterials and the tissue) of corona formed on specific nanomaterial surfaces.",

Achieving this realistic maximum will require several breakthroughs. First, outdoor operation typically has low yields, mainly caused by fluctuating insolation. Future adaptive control models will help increase these yields. Additionally, the lipid production capacity of currently used strains needs to increase. Powerful strain-specific molecular toolboxes are being developed, shifting the bottleneck towards understanding metabolism and identifying target genes.

These techniques promise to identify functional phenotypes associated with disease states and to identify compounds that improve cellular function regardless of whether the compound acts directly on a target or through a bypass mechanism. This review discusses opportunities and unresolved challenges in applying optogenetic techniques throughout the discovery pipeline – from target identification and validation, to target-based and phenotypic screens, to clinical trials.",

Therefore, ‘4D bioprinting’ has emerged recently, where ‘time’ is integrated with 3D bioprinting as the fourth dimension, and the printed objects can change their shapes or functionalities when an external stimulus is imposed or when cell fusion or postprinting self-assembly occurs. In this review, we highlight recent developments in 4D bioprinting technology. Additionally, we review the uses of 4D bioprinting in tissue engineering and drug delivery. Finally, we discuss the major roadblocks to this approach, together with possible solutions, to provide future perspectives on this technology.",

     "abstract": "Radiative forcing of methane (CH4) is significantly higher than carbon dioxide (CO2) and its enteric production by ruminant livestock is one of the major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. CH4 is also an important marker of farming productivity, because it is associated with the conversion of feed to product in livestock. Consequently, measurement of enteric CH4 is emerging as an important research topic. In this review, we briefly describe the conversion of carbohydrate to CH4 by the bacterial community within gut, and highlight some of the key host–microbiome interactions. We then provide a picture of current progress in techniques for measuring enteric CH4, the context in which these technologies are used, and the challenges faced. We also discuss solutions to existing problems and new approaches currently in development.",

     "abstract": "The field of metabolic engineering has delivered new microbial cell factories and processes for the production of different compounds including biofuels, (di)carboxylic acids, alcohols, and amino acids. Most of these processes are aerobic, with few exceptions (e.g., alcoholic fermentation), and attention is focused on assembling a high-flux product pathway with a production limit usually set by the oxygen transfer rate. By contrast, anaerobic product synthesis offers significant benefits compared to aerobic systems: higher yields, less heat generation, reduced biomass production, and lower mechanical energy input, which can significantly reduce production costs. Using simple thermodynamic calculations, we demonstrate that many products can theoretically be produced under anaerobic conditions using several conventional and non-conventional substrates.",

Production delays and interventions with starter cultures and nutritional supplements have significant cost and quality implications; thus, optimization of O. oeni has long been a priority. A range of optimization strategies, some guided by detailed characterization of O. oeni, have been exploited.

While industrial efforts to find and develop novel antimicrobials have been severely reduced during the past two decades, the increasing threat of multidrug-resistant pathogens and the development of new technologies to find and produce such compounds have again attracted interest in this field. Based on improvements in whole-genome sequencing, novel methods have been developed to identify the secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters by genome mining, to clone them, and to express them in heterologous hosts in much higher throughput than before. These technologies now enable metabolic engineering approaches to optimize production yields and to directly manipulate the pathways to generate modified products.",

Cell based therapies may potentially recover native tendon function, if tenocyte trans-differentiation can be evaded and stem cell differentiation towards tenogenic lineage is attained. To this end, recreating an artificial in vivo tendon niche by engineering functional in vitro microenvironments is a research priority. Clinically relevant cell based therapies for tendon repair and regeneration could be created using tools that harness biophysical beacons (surface topography, mechanical loading), biochemical cues (oxygen tension), and biological signals (growth factors).",

Depriving viruses of crucial replication machinery, TIPs would reduce viral loads.

HBOCs have several advantages over human blood, including availability, long-term storage, and lack of infectious risk. The basis of HBOC toxicity is poorly understood, however, several mechanisms have been suggested, including Hb extravasation across the blood vessel wall, scavenging of endothelial nitric oxide (NO), oversupply of oxygen, and heme-mediated oxidative side reactions. Although there are some in vitro and limited animal studies supporting these mechanisms, heme-mediated reactivity appears to provide an alternative path that can explain some of the observed pathophysiological changes.

Furthermore, computational modeling effectively facilitates the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Among other methods, dissipative particle dynamics and the lattice Boltzmann method have become increasingly popular during recent years due to their ability to solve a large variety of problems.

These bifunctional actions – catabolic versus anabolic – are readily identifiable in in vivo metabolic processes involving laccases.

Mosquito transgenesis involves direct genetic engineering of the mosquito itself for delivery of anti-Plasmodium effector molecules. Conversely, paratransgenesis involves the genetic modification of mosquito symbionts for expression of anti-pathogen effector molecules. Here we consider both genetic manipulation strategies for rendering mosquitoes refractory to Plasmodium infection, and discuss challenges for the translation of laboratory findings to field applications.",

Although technologies for immobilization have largely reached maturity, the resulting biocatalysts are not well understood mechanistically. One limitation is that their internal environment is usually inferred from external data. Therefore, biological consequences of the immobilization remain masked by physical effects of mass transfer, obstructing further development. Work reviewed herein shows that opto-chemical sensing performed directly within the solid support enables the biocatalyst's internal environment to be uncovered quantitatively and in real time. Non-invasive methods of intraparticle pH and O2 determination are presented, and their use as process analytical tools for development of heterogeneous biocatalysts is described. Method diversification to other analytes remains a challenging task for the future.",

In this review, we present a range of experimental approaches based on combinatorial and directed evolution methods used to explore sequence space and recreate structured or active proteins. These approaches can help to understand constraints of natural evolution and can lead to new useful proteins. Strategies such as binary patterning or modular assembly can efficiently speed structural and functional innovation. Many natural protein architectures are symmetric or repeated and presumably have emerged by coalescence of simpler fragments. This process can be experimentally reproduced; a range of artificial proteins obtained from idealized fragments has recently been described and some of these have already found direct applications.",

It has a wide range of applications and nominally can be used to characterize biomolecules and nanoparticles ranging in size from a few nanometers (∼3 nm) to several hundred nanometers, to obtain multimodal size distributions in minutes. Although both the ES and the DMA are mature technologies, they are finding increased use in combination to characterize particles in liquids. In this paper, we review ES–DMA, and how it has recently been used to characterize bionanoparticles such as polymers, proteins, viruses, bacteriophages and nanoparticle–biomolecule conjugates.",

The realisation of this potential will require manipulation of the fundamental biology of algal physiology to increase the efficiency with which solar energy is ultimately converted into usable biomass. This ‘photosynthetic solar energy conversion efficiency’ sets an upper limit on the potential of algal-derived biofuels. In this review, we outline photosynthetic molecular targets that could be manipulated to increase the efficiency and yield of algal biofuel production. We also highlight modern ‘omic’ and high-throughput technologies that might enable identification, selection and improvement of algal cell lines on timescales relevant for achieving significant contributions to future energy solutions.",

To address these challenges, we discuss a process where CO2 is captured as bicarbonate and used as feedstock for algae culture, and the carbonate regenerated by the culture process is used as an absorbent to capture more CO2. This process would significantly reduce carbon capture costs because it does not require additional energy for carbonate regeneration. Furthermore, not only would transport of the aqueous bicarbonate solution cost less than for that of compressed CO2, but using bicarbonate would also provide a superior alternative for CO2 delivery to an algae culture system.",

This excitement has been driven in large part by the success of MNPs as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging. The recent investigative trend with respect to cancer has continued down a diagnostic path, but has also turned toward concurrent therapy, giving rise to the distinction of MNPs as potential “theranostics”. Here we review both the key technical principles of MNPs and ongoing advancement toward a cancer theranostic MNP. Recent progress in diagnostics, hyperthermia treatments, and drug delivery are all considered. We conclude by identifying current barriers to clinical translation of MNPs and offer considerations for their future development.",

A microstructured reactor that is fully automated and analytically equipped presents a powerful screening tool with which to perform biocatalyst selection and optimization of process conditions at intermediary stages of process development. Enhanced mass transfer provided by the microstructured reactor can be exploited for process intensification, particularly during multiphase biocatalytic processing where mass transfer across phase boundaries is often limiting. Reversible immobilization of enzymes in microchannels remains a challenge for flexible realization of biotransformations in microstructured reactors. Compartmentalization in microstructured reactors could be useful in performing multistep chemoenzymatic conversions.",

Although frequently associated with disease and biofouling, biofilms are also important for engineering applications, such as bioremediation, biocatalysis and microbial fuel cells. Here, we review approaches to alter genetic circuits and cell signaling towards controlling biofilm formation, and emphasize utilizing these tools for engineering applications. Based on a better understanding of the genetic basis of biofilm formation, we find that biofilms might be controlled by manipulating extracellular signals, and that they might be dispersed using conserved intracellular signals and regulators. Biofilms could also be formed at specific locations where they might be engineered to make chemicals or treat human disease.",

Here, we review recent research involving the engineering of cyanobacterial species for the production of valuable bioindustrial compounds, including natural cyanobacterial products (e.g. sugars and isoprene), biofuels (e.g. alcohols, alkanes and hydrogen), and other commodity chemicals. Biological and economic obstacles to scaled cyanobacterial production are highlighted, and methods for increasing cyanobacterial production efficiencies are discussed.",

That is, protein and nucleic acids that sense chemical cues and, by undergoing specific, binding-induced conformational changes, transduce this recognition into high-gain signal outputs. Here, we argue that devices that employ such switches represent a promising route towards versatile, real-time molecular monitoring in vivo.",

     "abstract": "Since the founding of the osseointegration concept, the characteristics of the interface between bone and implant, and possible ways to improve it, have been of particular interest in dental and orthopaedic implant research. Making use of standardized tools of analysis and terminology, we present here a standardized characterization code for osseointegrated implant surfaces. This code describes the chemical composition of the surface, that is, the core material, such as titanium, and its chemical or biochemical modification through impregnation or coating. This code also defines the physical surface features, at the micro- and nanoscale, such as microroughness, microporosity, nanoroughness, nanotubes, nanoparticles, nanopatterning and fractal architecture. This standardized classification system will allow to clarify unambiguously the identity of any given osseointegrated surface and help to identify the biological outcomes of each surface characteristic.",

Gold nanoparticles generally are considered to be biologically inert but can be engineered to possess chemical or photothermal functionality. A growing body of research is devoted to the potential use of these nanoparticles in the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections. The results are both promising and intriguing, and suggest a range of new strategies to identify, target or destroy pathogenic organisms.",

In this review, we discuss the progress achieved in understanding the mechanisms and principles that govern microenvironmental regulation of SC behavior, and focus on novel approaches that have been developed to synthesize this basic information to engineer creative strategies for harnessing and controlling SCs ex vivo and in vivo.",

This review focuses on the potential of this latter technology to modify mammalian genomes without the need to apply challenging and less-efficient protocols.

Furthermore, bacterial siderophores are able to bind metals other than iron and thus enhance their bioavailability in the rhizosphere of plants. Overall, an increase in plant growth and metal uptake will further enhance the effectiveness of phytoremediation processes.

Conventional microdialysis and microfiltration, which require collecting relatively large samples, are however often impractical and semi-quantitative; hence, we focus on ultraslow sampling to circumvent such limitations. Ultraslow microdialysis and microfiltration already have been used successfully for quantitative pharmacokinetics, glucose metabolism (e.g. of the brain), cytokines and proteomics (e.g. tumour secretomes), both in vivo and in vitro.",

However, these fungi are less tractable genetically than the ascomycetes, which predominantly produce lower-potential laccases. We address the state-of-play regarding expression of high reduction potential laccases in heterologous hosts, and issues regarding enzyme glycosylation status. We describe the synergistic role of structural biology, particularly in unmasking structure–function relationships following genetic modification and their collective impact on laccase yields. Such recent research draws closer the prospect of industrial quantities of designer, fit-for-purpose laccases.",

Upon injury, forisomes occlude sieve tubes by dispersion and thus, help to prevent loss of nutrient-rich transport sap.

In vitro, forisomes reversibly disperse and contract in the presence or absence of Ca2+, respectively, and at distinct pHs. Recently, forisomes have received renewed attention because of their unique capacity to convert chemical into mechanical energy independent of high-energy organic compounds. Forisome-based ‘smart’ materials can be used to produce self-powered monitoring and diagnostic systems.

While biocontainment might be achieved using male sterility or transgenic mitigation tools, we believe that perhaps the optimal solution might be simply to remove transgenes from pollen. Male sterility might not be ideal for many pollinators, and might not be implementable using standardized genes. Transgenic mitigation might not be useful to control conspecific gene flow (e.g. crop to crop), and relies on competition and not biocontainment per se. Site-specific recombination systems could allow highly efficient excision of transgenes in pollen to eliminate, or at least minimize, unwanted transgene movement via pollen dispersal. There are other potential biotechnologies, such as zinc finger nucleases, that could be also used for transgene excision.",

Conserved secondary structure, rather than primary sequence, is the hallmark of many functionally important RNAs, because compensatory substitutions in base-paired regions preserve structure. Unfortunately, such substitutions also obscure sequence identity and confound alignment algorithms, which complicates analysis greatly. This paper surveys recent computational advances in this difficult arena, which have enabled genome-scale prediction of cross-species conserved RNA elements. These predictions suggest that a wealth of these elements indeed exist.",
