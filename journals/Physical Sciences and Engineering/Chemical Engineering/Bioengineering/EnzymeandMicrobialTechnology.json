     "abstract": "O-Methylation of N-acetylserotonin (NAS) has been identified as the bottleneck in melatonin biosynthesis pathway. In the present paper, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtCOMT) was engineered by rational design to improve its catalytic efficiency in conversion of NAS to melatonin. Based on the notable difference in the terminal structure of caffeic acid and NAS, mutants were designed to strengthen the interactions between the substrate binding pocket of the enzyme and the terminal structure of the unnatural substrate NAS. The final triple mutant (C296F-Q310L-V314T) showed 9.5-fold activity improvement in O-methylation of NAS. Molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy analysis attributed the increased activity to the higher affinity between the substrate terminal structure and AtCOMT, resulting from the introduction of NH⋯π interaction by Phe296 substitution, hydrophobic interaction by Thr314 substitution and elimination of electrostatic repulsion by substitution of Gln310 with Leu310. This work provides hints for O-methyltransferase engineering and meanwhile lays foundation for biotechnological production of melatonin.",

     "abstract": "Adipate is a linear C6 dicarboxylic acid, and is a crucial commercial material mainly used to produce the polymer nylon-6,6. In this study, the pathway producing adipate via a reverse reaction of degradation pathway of adipic acid was ported from Thermobifida fusca to Escherichia coli (E. coli). The pathway contains 6 genes: Tfu_0875, Tfu_2399, Tfu_0067, Tfu_1647, Tfu_2576 and Tfu_2577, which encodes β-ketothiolase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 3-hydroxyadipyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 5-carboxy-2-pentenoyl-CoA reductase and adipyl-CoA synthetase, respectively. Of the genes in this pathway, Tfu_1647 is the limited step.Here, we constructed a homology model of 5-carboxy-2-pentenoyl-CoA reductase and found that Lys295 and Glu334 were the active sites. We carried out ten site-directed mutations of these two residues including E334D, K295R, K295Q, K295Y, K295 F, E334R, E334H, E334 K, E334 W, and E334 F. The enzymatic activity of Tfu_1647 in pTrc99A-0067-1647 of E334D, E334 F, and E334R were much higher than that in the control. The Km values of E334D, E334 F, and E334R were significantly reduced compared with the control. The strain with E334D had the highest adipic acid titer (0.23 g/L) with 5.8% of the theoretical yield. The rational reconstruction of 5-carboxy-2-pentenoyl-CoA reductase is a potential approach in improving the enzymatic activity and titer of adipate.",

     "abstract": "The cell wall integrity and stress response component (WSC) domain was first described in the Wsc-family protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and later found in diverse eukaryotic organisms. Due solely to their presence in the Wsc-family proteins working as a plasma membrane sensor for surface stress and in a fungal β-1,3-exoglucanse, WSC domains have been presumed to possess carbohydrate-binding property without any experimental evidence. Aiming at elucidation of function(s) of WSC domains, we characterized a WSC domain-containing alcohol oxidase from the rice blast pathogen Pyricularia oryzae (PoAlcOX). Recombinant PoAlcOX produced with Pichia pastoris showed alcohol oxidase activity toward a wide range of substrates including two aliphatic alcohols, a branched-chain alcohol, a diol, and a polyol. Deletion of the WSC domain virtually unaffected oxidation of these substrates by PoAlcOX, indicating that the domain makes no contribution to the catalytic activity. In analogy to some carbohydrate-binding modules, we inferred that the WSC domain plays a role in protein anchoring, and evaluated binding capability of PoAlcOX to a set of polysaccharide components of fungal and plant cell walls. This revealed that PoAlcOX binds to xylans and fungal chitin/β-1,3-glucan in the WSC domain-dependent manner, demonstrating for the first time the carbohydrate-binding property of the domain. Additionally, we provide evidence that PoAlcOX immobilized on birch wood xylan retains the catalytic activity. Overall, the data we collected suggest that the role of the WSC domain of PoAlcOX is not recognition of substrates but attaching the enzyme to plant and/or fungal cell wall.",

     "abstract": "Intradiol dioxygenases (EC 1.13.11.1) are bacterial enzymes that catalyze the ring cleavage of catechols which is a central step in the aerobic degradation of aromatic compounds. Some members of this enzyme group have a C-terminus which is 4–5% longer (an additional 13–18 amino acids) compared to the majority of known sequences. The longer C-terminus itself is not highly conserved and appears to be poorly integrated in the protein structural models developed for representative intradiol dioxygenases. Using a protein engineering approach variant intradiol dioxygenases were produced by truncating the C-terminus to a size comparable to the shorter versions of the enzyme. Three enzymes were selected and were originally described from the model organisms; Burkholderia xenovorans LB400, Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1. The activity of the truncated enzymes were compared to the unmodified enzymes which revealed that truncation of the C-terminus could alter the enzyme activity; increasing the LB400 enzyme activity by as much as five fold, but reducing the activity of the intradiol dioxygenases from KT2440 and ADP1. The difference in effect is explained by the presence of a greater number of amino acid residues that can contribute to forming stable protein structures in the KT2440 and ADP1 enzymes. It is hypothesized that C-terminal truncation could in some cases provide a useful strategy for increasing intradiol dioxygenase activity for biotechnological production of muconic and adipic acids.",

In this work, to overcome the limitation of ChKRED20 to aryl ketoesters, we first refined the X-ray crystal structure of ChKRED20/NAD+ complex at a resolution of 1.6 Å, and then performed three rounds of iterative saturation mutagenesis at critical amino acid sites to reshape the active cavity of the enzyme. For methyl 2-oxo-2-phenylacetate and ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoate, several gain-of-activity mutants were achieved, and for ethyl 2-oxo-4-phenylbutanoate, improved mutants were achieved with kcat/Km increasing to 196-fold of the wild-type. All three substrates were completely reduced at 100 g/l loading catalyzed with selected ChKRED20 mutants, and deliver the corresponding chiral alcohols with >90% isolated yield and 97 - >99%ee.",

     "abstract": "2-Hydroxy acid dehydrogenases (2-HADHs) have been implicated in the synthesis of 2-hydroxy acids from 2-oxo acids that are used in wide areas of industry. d-lactate dehydrogenases (d-LDHs), a subfamily of 2-HADH, have been utilized to this purpose, yet they exhibited relatively low catalytic activity to the 2-oxo acids with large functional groups at C3. In this report, four putative 2-HADHs from Oenococcus oeni, Weissella confusa, Weissella koreensis and Pediococcus claussenii were examined for activity on phenylpyruvate (PPA), a substrate to 3-phenyllactic acid (PLA) with a C3 phenyl group. The 2-HADH from P. claussenii was found to have the highest kcat/Km on PPA with 1,348.03 s−1 mM−1 among the four enzymes with higher substrate preference for PPA than pyruvate. Sequential, structural and mutational analysis of the enzyme revealed that it belonged to the d-LDH family, and phenylalanine at the position 51 was the key residue for the PPA binding to the active site via hydrophobic interaction, whereas in the 2-HADHs from O. oeni and W. confusa the hydrophilic tyrosine undermined the interaction. Because phenyllactate is a potential precursor for pharmaceutical compounds, antibiotics and biopolymers, the enzyme could increase the efficiency of bio-production of valuable chemicals. This study suggests a structural basis for the high substrate preference of the 2-HADH, and further engineering possibilities to synthesize versatile 2-hydroxy acids.",

     "abstract": "Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous is an excellent industrial source for production of natural astaxanthin, but the yield of astaxanthin is relative low due to the contradiction between biomass weight and astaxanthin accumulation. Glutamate, a metabolite connecting nitrogen and carbon metabolisms, is probably a promising entry point to interfere cellular metabolisms. Thus, the effect of glutamate on cell growth and astaxanthin accumulation in X. dendrorhous was investigated. Results showed that glutamate feeding facilitated glucose consumption and further led to the increment of astaxanthin content with little influence of cell growth. A comparative proteomics study was applied to decipher the regulatory mechanisms of enhanced astaxanthin biosynthesis in X. dendrorhous as a response to the glutamate feeding. The expressions of proteins with the highest degree of fold change were involved in carbohydrate, amino acids, and carotenogenesis metabolisms as well as redox and stress-associated metabolisms. In addition, a possible regulatory model of enhanced astaxanthin accumulation in response to glutamate feeding in X. dendrorhous is also proposed.",

In this research, FOS produced by BfrA were characterized by HPAE–PAD analysis as a mixture of 1–kestotriose, 6G–kestotriose (neokestose), and to a major extent 6–kestotriose. In order to increase the FOS yield, three BfrA mutants (W14Y, W14Y–N16S and W14Y–W256Y), designed from sequence divergence between hydrolases and transferases, were constructed and constitutively expressed in the non–saccharolytic yeast Pichia pastoris. The secreted recombinant glycoproteins were purified and characterized. The three mutants synthesized 6–kestotriose as the major component of a FOS mixture that includes minor amounts of tetra– and pentasaccharides. In all cases, sucrose hydrolysis was the predominant reaction. All mutants reached a similar overall FOS yield, with the average value 37.6% (w/w) being 3–fold higher than that of the wild–type enzyme (12.6%, w/w). None of the mutations altered the enzyme thermophilicity and thermostability. The single mutant W14Y, with specific activity of 841 U mg−1, represents an attractive candidate for the continuous production of FOS–containing invert syrup at pasteurization temperatures.",

The CXFeNGO catalyst was characterized using a scanning electron microscope, and X-ray diffraction, and the catalytic activity was confirmed using cyclic voltammetry studies. At the anode, colonization of bacterial cells on the electrode surface, forming a biofilm, was observed. When the CXFeNGO-modified electrode was used at the cathode in the MFC, a maximum power density of 176.5 ± 6 mW m−2 was obtained, compared to that of plain graphite electrode, which produced 139.1 ± 4 mW m−2. The power density of the modified electrode is thus 26.8% higher. The power density further increased to 48.6% when the pH of the catholyte was increased to 12, producing a power density of 207 ± 4 mW m−2.",

Firstly, the heterogenous crtEBI operon were overexpressed in 10 LPS mutant strains of E. coli W3110 (ΔwaaC, ΔwaaF, ΔwaaY, ΔwaaG, ΔwaaR, ΔwaaO, ΔwaaU, ΔwaaP, ΔwaaY and ΔwaaB), and their ability to produce lycopene were compared.

In order to enhance lycopene production, genes dxr, dxr, ispA, and idi were overexpressed in ΔwaaC/pWSK29-crtEBI, ΔwaaF/pWSK29-crtEBI individually or in combination, and the lycopene production in each strain was analyzed. The maximum yield of 5.39 mg/g was achieved in ΔwaaC/pWSK29-crtEBI-SRA, which is 142% higher than that in W3110/pWSK29-crtEBI.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven to be the suitable microorganism for large scale ethanol production, but production of other alcohols like butanol and using lignocellulosic substrates is restricted due to lacking tolerance toward toxicity of alcohols, and compounds released from substrates. This study aimed to produce a tolerant strain by using pprI gene of Deinococcus radiodurans.pprI gene was introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To evaluate the recombinant gene expression, the qPCR was performed. By Gas chromatography, the yield of ethanol production was measured. To estimate the yield of ethanol production each strain was normally cultured in a treated lignocellulosic substrate. The S. cerevisiaes tolerance toward increased salt, ethanol, and butanol concentrations was checked.Recombinant yeasts tolerated up to 1.2 M salt (7%) and grew well, while normal strain could only survive under 0.85 M (5%) salt concentration. At 5%, 7.5%, 8.5%, 9.5% and 11% ethanol concentrations (v/v), normal cells growth stopped at 7.5% and above; whereas, mutant strains tolerated up to 11% ethanol and proliferated. The mutant yeast’s capability to grow in 0.5% and 1% v/v of butanol was raised by 3 and 2.25 fold.Expression of pprI in different cells increases the tolerance toward various compounds including ethanol, salt and butanol along with boosted yield of biofuel production from ligonocellulosic substrate.

Microbial oxidation of endosulfan forms endosulfan sulfate, which is more or less toxic and persistent as endosulfan.

In the present study, X-ray crystal structures of enzymes from Brookhaven Protein Data Bank were screened for their potential to degrade endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation techniques. A phenol hydroxylase, 1PN0 from Trichosporon cutaneum was found to have the potential to degrade both α-endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate while a bacterial CotA laccase, 3ZDW from Bacillus subtilis has the potential to degrade α-endosulfan. The in silico result correlate with in vitro degradation study using two different strains of Trichosporon cutaneum. In vitro degradation study found that the fungal strain was capable of degrading 60.36% α-endosulfan, 70.73% β-endosulfan, and 52.08% endosulfan sulfate. The presence of phenol hydroxylase inhibitor in the sulfur-free medium with endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate as sole sulfur source inhibits the growth of both the fungal strains. Such in silico techniques can provide an easy and reliable way to speed up the development of bioremediation processes through rapid identification of potential enzymes and microbes to counter the ever-increasing number of toxic compounds in the environment.",

Equivocal protein citrullination by PADs of fungal pathogens has a strong relation to the progression of multiple human diseases, however, the biochemical properties of fungal PADs remain ambiguous. Thus, this is the first report exploring the molecular properties of PAD from thermotolerant fungi, to imitate the human temperature. The teleomorph Emericella dentata and anamorph Aspergillus nidulans have been morphologically and molecularly identified, with observed robust growth at 37–40 °C, and strong PAD productivity. The physiological profiles of E. dentata and A. nidulans for PADs production in response to carbon, nitrogen sources, initial medium pH and incubation temperature were relatively identical, emphasizing the taxonomical proximity of these fungal isolates. PADs were purified from E. dentata and A. nidulans with apparent molecular masses 41 and 48 kDa, respectively. The peptide fingerprints of PADs from E. dentata and A. nidulans have been analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS, displaying a higher sequence similarity to human PAD4 by 18% and 31%, respectively. The conserved peptide sequences of E. dentata and A. nidulans PADs displayed a higher similarity to human PAD than A. fumigatus PADs clade. PADs from both fungal isolates have an optimum pH and pH stability at 7.0–8.0, with putative pI 5.0–5.5, higher structural denaturation at pH 4.0–5.5 and 9.5–12 as revealed from absorbance at λ280nm. E. dentata PAD had a higher conformationally thermal stability than A. nidulans PAD as revealed from its lower Kr value. From the proteolytic mapping, the orientation of trypsinolytic recognition sites on the PADs surface from both fungal isolates was very similar. PADs from both isolates are calcium dependent, with participation of serine and cysteine residues on their catalytic sites. PADs displayed a higher affinity to deiminate the peptidylarginine residues with a feeble affinity to work as ADI. So, PADs from E. dentata and A. nidulans had a relatively similar conformational and kinetic properties. Further molecular modeling analysis are ongoing to explore the role of PADs in citrullination of human proteins in Aspergillosis, that will open a new avenue for unraveling the vague of protein-protein interaction of human A. nidulans pathogen.",

During IPL irradiation, lipase activity decreased significantly with increasing pulse fluence (Fp) and exposure time (te). IPL-induced deactivation kinetics were further elucidated based on a two-step series-type deactivation model (constant deactivation rate k1 > k2). Fp was found to be the dominant variable affecting the degree of lipase deactivation, and residual activity was not associated with increasing te below a certain Fp energy density (2.66 mJ/cm2), implying a critical threshold for IPL-induced deactivation of lipase. From the results of fluorescence spectroscopy and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), we determined that IPL-induced deactivation was caused by fragmentation, leading to lipase tertiary structural changes. Furthermore, the results of FindPept analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) indicated that the internal sensitive bonds of lipase were cleaved preferentially by IPL, such that IPL irradiation induced site-sensitive fragmentation and peptide bond cleavage.",

     "abstract": "A β-mannanase gene was cloned from Bacillus sp. MK-2 and expressed in Bacillus subtilis WB800. The ORF of the β-mannanase gene was 1104 bp in length, encoding 367 aa. The deduced amino acid sequence shared high sequence identity with the β-mannanase from Bacillus subtilis, and belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 26. The purified recombinant enzyme had a specific activity of 2802 U/mg and displayed optimum activity at pH 6.0 and 55 °C. To obtain an enzyme with high specific activity and facilitate its industrial applications, molecular engineering of Bman26 was undertaken using random mutagenesis in Bacillus subtilis WB800. Three positive mutants with substantially improved specific activities were selected and studied. The best performing mutant was K291E, for which the single amino acid substitution led to a 3.5-fold increase in kcat/Km. Mutants Q112R and L211I also exhibited an apparently increased kcat/Km towards konjac glucomannan, approximately 200% and 80% improvement, respectively. Structural-functional analysis indicated that a slight conformational change could dramatically affect certain enzyme characteristics. In addition, three amino acid sites (Gly88-Leu212-Lys288) in Bman26 were found to have close relationships with the enzyme’s thermal stability. These new findings will help promote the development of industrially useful β-mannanase, with both good thermal stability and high specific activity.",

Acidic adaptation of pullulanases is of special interest. In this study, we conducted protein engineering to improve the acidic adaptation of Bacillus acidopullulyticus pullulanase (BaPul) and used a hydrogen-bond-based approach to identify promising residues that may change the deprotonation constants (pKa) of the catalytic residues. A total of 19 amino acids were selected for mutation according to the crystal structure of BaPul. The pH optimum of the L627R mutant shifted from 5.0 to 4.0, and its relative activity at pH 4.0 was 117% that of the wide-type enzyme. The improved efficacy of the L627R mutant at pH 4.0 was confirmed by kinetic parameters and pKa prediction. Moreover, the L627R mutant exhibited increased tolerance against acid-mediated denaturation, and its maximum d-glucose content (97.4%) was obtained after 40 h incubation, which is shorter by 10 h compared with the time required by the wide-type enzyme to produce a comparable amount of the monosaccharide. The L627R mutant may be suitable for industrial application because its shortened reaction time translates to reduced energy consumption.",

For photometric detection of ammonia formed in the course of enzymatic hydrolysis of urea, the Berthelot method and the Nessler reaction have been examined. For both these detection schemes very simple dedicated optoelectronic flow-through detectors made of paired light emitting diodes have been developed. In both systems single enzyme assay lasting a few minutes allows determination of urease in activity range 0.02–5.3 U mL−1 with detection limit 0.02 U mL−1 and in 1.3–5.3 U mL−1 range with 0.75 U mL−1 detection limit for Nessler reaction and Berthelot method based systems, respectively. When compared with mechanized Berthelot method, the bioanalytical system based on Nessler reaction offers higher sensitivity, lower detection/determination limits, better selectivity and lower cost of the assay.

In the first, xylose reductase gene GRE3 was fused with two parts of the CCW12 gene, the N-terminal one coding for the secretion signal sequence, and the C–terminal coding for the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchoring signal. Transformed cells synthesized xylose reductase and incorporated it in the cell wall through the remnant of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. The other construct was prepared by fusing the GRE3 with the PIR4 gene coding for one of the proteins of the Pir-family containing the characteristic N-terminal repetitive sequence that anchors Pir proteins to β-1,3-glucan. In this way xylose reductase was covalently attached to glucan through its N-terminus. For the expression of the constructs either the GAL1, or the PHO5 promoters have been used. Both strains displayed active xylose reductases and their enzyme properties were compared with the control enzyme bearing the secretion signal sequence but no anchoring signals, thus secreted into the medium. The enzyme displayed through the N-terminal fusion with PIR4 had higher affinity for xylose than the other construct, but they both expressed somewhat lower affinity than the control enzyme. Similarly, the Km values for NADPH of both immobilized enzymes were somewhat higher than the Km of the control XR. Both displayed enzymes, especially the one fused with Pir4, had higher thermal and pH stability than the control, while other enzymatic properties were not significantly impaired by surface immobilization.",

This paper is aimed to simplify the strategy of removing epitope tags from target proteins with HRV 3C protease. Fusion proteins composed of a xylanase from Bacillus sp. HBP8 (xylHB) and double tags (MBP/Nus and 6×His, with an HRV 3C protease recognition site between them) were applied as substrates. To perform the cleavage and purification, strains expressing HRV 3C protease and the substrates were mixed before (co-fermentation method) or after (post-fermentation method) inducing with IPTG, followed by cell disruption and incubation at 4℃, overnight for cleavage. The soluble cytoplasmic fraction was added to Ni-NTA resin to recover the cleaved target protein. Because the process was carried out in the cell lysate, it was named as cell lysate purification system based on HRV 3C protease (CLP3C). Our data indicated small number of cells expressing HRV 3C protease was enough to remove the fusion tags efficiently with both co-fermentation and post-fermentation methods. More importantly, the tags were cleaved precisely with no obvious non-specific degradation to the target protein. Hence, active xylanase was recovered easily with this strategy.",

According to the results, the optimum immobilization conditions were as follows: glutaraldehyde concentration of 0.10 mol L−1, the carrier concentration of 7 mg L−1, the temperature of 35 °C and immobilization time of 180 min. The loading capacity of the immobilized HRP arrived to 139.82 mg g−1 (RSD = 0.87%).

The aim of this study was to find a stable recombinant PAL with suitable kinetic properties among all natural PAL producing species using in silico and experimental approaches. To find such a stable PAL among 481 natural isoforms, 48,000 of 3-D models were predicted using the Modeller 9.10 program and evaluated by Ramachandran plot. Correlation analysis between Ramachandran plot and the energy of different thermodynamic components indicated that this plot could be an appropriate tool to predict protein stability. Hence, PAL6 from Lotus japonicus (LjPAL6) was selected as a stable isoform. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation for 50 ns and docking has been conducted for LjPAL6-phenylalanine complex. The best PAL-phenylalanine frame was selected by re-docking with l-phenylalanine (L-Phe) and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value. MD simulation showed that the complex has a good stability, depicted by the low RMSD value, binding free energy and hydrogen bindings. Docking results showed that LjPAL6 has a high affinity toward l-Phe according to the low level of binding free energy. By overexpressing Ljpal6 in E. coli BL21, a total of 33.5 mg/l of protein was obtained, which has been increased to 83.7 mg/l via the optimization of LjPAL6 production using response surface methodology. The optimal pH and temperature were 8.5 and 50 °C, respectively. LjPAL6 showed a specific activity of 42 nkat/mg protein, with Km, Kcat and Kcat/Km values of 0.483 mM, 7 S−1 and 14.5 S−1 mM−1 for l-phe, respectively. In conclusion, finding models with the most reasonable stereo-chemical quality and lowest numbers of steric clashes would result in easier folding. Hence, in silico analyses of bulk data from natural origin will lead one to find an optimal model for in vitro studies and drug design.",

Laccase activity is commonly determined by monitoring spectrophotometric changes (absorbance) of the product or substrate during the enzymatic reaction. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) is a fast and versatile technique where spectral evolution profiling, i.e. assessment of the spectral changes of both substrate and products during enzymatic conversion in real time, can be used to assess enzymatic activity when combined with multivariate data analysis. We employed FTIR to monitor enzymatic oxidation of monolignols (sinapyl, coniferyl and p-coumaryl alcohol), sinapic acid, and sinapic aldehyde by four different laccases: three fungal laccases from Trametes versicolor, Trametes villosa and Ganoderma lucidum, respectively, and one bacterial laccase from Meiothermus ruber. By coupling the FTIR measurements with Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) we established a quantitative assay for assessing laccase activity. By combining PARAFAC modelling with Principal Component Analysis we show the usefulness of this technology as a multivariate tool able to compare and distinguish different laccase reaction patterns. We also demonstrate how the FTIR approach can be used to create a reference system for laccase activity comparison based on a relatively low number of measurements. Such a reference system has potential to function as a high-throughput method for comparing reaction pattern similarities and differences between laccases and hereby identify new and interesting enzyme candidates in large sampling pools.",

     "abstract": "Xylan, the most abundant hemicellulose in lignocellulosic biomass, requires a consortium of xylanolytic enzymes to achieve its complete de-polymerisation. As global interest in using xylan-containing lignocellulosic feedstocks for biofuel production increases, an accompanying knowledge on how to efficiently depolymerise these feedstocks into fermentable sugars is required. Since it has been observed that the same enzyme [i.e. an enzyme with the same EC (Enzyme Commission) classification] from different GH families can display different substrate speciﬁcities and properties, we evaluated GH10 (XT6) and 11 (Xyn2A) xylanase performance alone, and in combination, during xylan depolymerisation. Synergistic enhancement with respect to reducing sugar release was observed when Xyn2A at 75% loading was supplemented with 25% loading of XT6 for both beechwood glucuronoxylan (1.14-fold improvement) and wheat arabinoxylan (1.1-fold improvement) degradation. Following this, the optimised xylanase mixture was dosed with an oligosaccharide reducing-end xylanase (Rex8A) from either Bifidobacterium adolescentis or Bacillus halodurans for further synergistic enhancement. Dosing 75% of the xylanase mixture (Xyn2A:XT6 at 75:25%) with 25% loading of Rex8A led to an enhancement of reducing sugar (up to an 1.1-fold improvement) and xylose release (up to an 1.5-fold improvement); however, this effect was both xylan and Rex8A specific. Using thin layer chromatography, synergism appeared to be a result of the GH10 and 11 xylanases liberating xylo-oligomers that are preferred substrates of the processive Rex8As. Rex8As then hydrolysed xylo-oligomers to xylose - and xylobiose which was the preferred substrate for xylosidase, SXA. This likely explains why there was a significant improvement in xylose release in the presence of Rex8As. Here, it was shown that Rex8As are key enzymes in the efficient saccharification of hetero-xylan into xylose, a major component of lignocellulosic substrates.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this study is to enhance the production of industrially valuable xylanase and pectinase enzymes in short duration, using agrowaste extracted substrates. Conventional cum statistical multifactor analysis approaches were used in order to evaluate the effect of crude extracted substrates, supplemented for the production of xylanase-pectinase enzymes. Incorporation of crude extracted xylan (1.2 mg/ml of inoculum) and pectin (4.8 mg/ml of inoculum) substrates in inoculum resulted in maximal xylanase (320 ± 15) and pectinase titre (90 ± 8) after 48 h, using 2% wheat bran and 2% citrus peel in production medium with 48 h of fermentation time, with one variable factor at a time approach. The best condition obtained after performing statistical multifactor interaction analysis includes 5.50 mg/ml of pectin in inoculum,1.50 mg/ml of xylan in inoculum, wheat bran 3%, temperature 37.5 °C, time 48 h, 7 mg/ml of pectin in production medium, peptone 1.05%, inoculum size 2% and inoculum age of 20 h, with alkaline xylanase activity of 415.22 ± 18.50 IU/ml and alkaline pectinase activity of 109.10 ± 8.80 IU/ml.

Here, we investigated whether tyrosine-protein kinase Src64B-like is involved in the cell entry of BmCPV. The Src64B-like gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli), and the recombinant protein Src64B-like was used to immunize mouse for preparation of anti-Src64B-like polyclonal antibody (pAb). After Src64B-like gene was silenced by RNAi, the infection of BmCPV was reduced by 59.48% ± 2.18% and 92.22% ± 1.12% in vitro and in vivo autonomously. Contrary to it, BmCPV infection could be enhanced by increasing the expression of Src64B-like. In addition, immunofluorescence assay showed that Src64B-like protein did not co-localize with BmCPV in the cultured BmN cells during viral infection. These results indicate that Src64B-like protein participates and plays an important role in the cell entry of BmCPV, but not contacting directly with BmCPV.",

     "abstract": "3,4 Dihydroxy phenyl l-alanine (L-DOPA) is the gold standard Parkinson's disease therapy. A heme-dependent peroxidase (HDP) catalyzes the ortho-hydroxylation of l-tyrosine to l-DOPA using H2O2 as the co-substrate. d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) catalyzes the oxidative deamination of d-amino acids (e.g. d-alanine), and H2O2 is evolved. However, both the enzymes DAAO and HDP can be inactivated by H2O2 during the catalysis. In situ generation and utilization of H2O2 can siginificatly reduce the inactivation by H2O2. HDP exists as a monomer and DAAO is a dimeric enzyme. Herein, the C-terminus of HDP was specifically ligated to the N-terminus of the DAAO subunit with native peptide through the in vivo monomer-subunit splicing. In the splicing product HDP&DAAO, HDP is close to the DAAO subunit at a molecular distance, and the transfer of H2O2 from DAAO to HDP is facilitated. In addition, HDP&DAAO exhibited a higher stability than HDP. Kinetics analysis showed that both the substrates l-tyrosine and d-alanine obey the Michaelis–Menten kinetics. For the deamination of d-alanine, the catalytic efficiency of HDP&DAAO is 3.05 times that of DAAO. For the sybthesis of l-DOPA from l-tyrosine, the catalytic efficiency of HDP&DAAO is 1.58 times that of HDP. Furthermore, HDP&DAAO was encapsulated within a Znic-based coordination polymer (Zn-CP). The morphorogy of HDP&DAAO/Zn-CP can be regulated by the enzyme concentration, the catalytic efficiency of the conjugates was found to be dependent on the morphorogy. The conjugates HDP&DAAO/Zn-CP exhibited a higher catalytic efficiency than free HDP&DAAO.",

In this study, to establish an efficient recombinant protein production technique in S. cerevisiae, the secretory production of recombinant protein endoglucanase II (TrEG) was tested. We developed 2 novel methods for TrEG production via clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) -δ-integration as well as multiple promoter shuffling, which involved the pre-breakdown of the δ-sequence by the CRISPR system and subsequent δ-integration as well as the conjugation of TrEG with various promoters and subsequent δ-integration, respectively. Moreover, simultaneous use of the CRISPR-δ-integration and multiple promoter shuffling methods was also examined. The CRISPR-δ-integration method was effective for improvement of the integrated TrEG copy number and its activity, and the multiple promoter shuffling method was also beneficial for enhancing the transcriptional level of TrEG and its activity. Furthermore, simultaneous use of CRISPR-δ-integration and multiple promoter shuffling methods was the most useful. The carboxymethyl cellulase activity of the TrEG expressing transformant YPH499/24CP constructed by the method reached 559 U/L, and it was 17.3-fold higher than that of the transformant constructed by the conventional YEp type vector. Overall, the simultaneous use of CRISPR-δ-integration and multiple promoter shuffling can be useful and easily applied for recombinant protein production.",

In order to investigate the o-quinone enzymatic production and its electrochemical behavior, a 2-D model was developed for a nanochip biosensor in COMSOL Multiphysics. The oxidation rate of phenol to o-quinone was predicted by the developed model based on Michaelis-Menten equation. The diffusion coefficient of o-quinone was obtained 2.17 × 10−6 cm2 s-1 based on experimental chronoamperograms. The cathodic and anodic peak potentials for o-quinone/catechol redox couple are obtained experimentally 255 and 310 mV, respectively. The obtained results from simulation were compared with the experimental results to verify the validity of the model. By comparing the cyclic voltammograms from the simulation and experimental results, the heterogeneous rate constant, k°, and the transfer coefficient, α, were calculated 0.02 cm s-1 and 0.5, respectively. Then, using simulation results, chronoamperograms were drawn for the nanochip biosensors with different heights. Also, o-quinone concentration gradients were determined at the electrode surface, which can be used to estimate the thickness of the diffusion layer. Finally, a calibration plot was obtained based on the simulation results of the proposed nanochip as phenol biosensor with the following equation I (nA) = 0.1497 C (μM)–0.3521 and a linear range of 20.0–150.0 μM.",

Although allopurinol decreases uric acid levels, it causes severe adverse effects. Therefore, more effort is needed in finding novel XO inhibitors with fewer side effects. In this study, differential pulse voltammetry was used to investigate the inhibitory effect of thymoquinone (TQ) on the XO activity while the major problem was the overlap of the obtained signals. Thus, Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) was applied to extract the useful information. Also, docking was used to investigate how TQ and the active site of XO fit together. PARAFAC results based on the voltammetry studies revealed that TQ blocks the catalytic centers of XO, which leads to a decrease in the electrochemical signal of Mo center in XO. The results also indicated the dose-dependent inhibition of XO with TQ. Molecular docking studies were shown TQ surrounds the active sites of XO and reduces the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid. Therefore, the electrochemical response of Mo decreases in the presence of TQ. This finding is in good agreement with the results obtained from molecular docking studies.",

Site-directed mutagenesis (S180G/Y215S) on N-terminal propeptide altered mutant contributed to the highest specific activity (4725 ± 65 U/mg, more than 1300 U/mg improvement than wild-type enzyme). This comprehensive mutation also achieved 2.5-fold improvement of extracellular enzyme yield in shake-flask level. The fermentation strategies about optimizing glycerol feeding and inducing point in scale-up bioreactor resulted in tremendous leakage of keratinolytic protease (954 mg/L extracellular yield within 48 h, about 9.26-fold higher than the original shake-flask level) as well as cell lysis.

After optimization of the conditions, the biphase system was constructed with propyl acetate and HAc-NaAc buffer (pH 4.5) (1:1, v/v) containing β-glucanase/epimedin B (1:2, w/w), and the hydrolysis was performed at 60 °C for 1 h. Consequently, epimedin B was completely hydrolyzed to sagittatoside B, and 95.7% of the product was transferred into the organic phase. Moreover, a high conversion ratio of 94.0% was achieved, even after the enzyme solution was used for six cycles. Additionally, the procedure was much simplified compared with conventional enzymatic hydrolysis.

To this end, Fe-MIL-88(NH2) was used to immobilize native luciferase and therphtalaldehyde linker was attached to the framework as an activated group. Interestingly, high loading capacity was observed in both bonding mechanisms. Furthermore, thermal stability and kinetic properties were improved very much but, thermodynamic/kinetic results and bonding efficiency is much better in the modified-MOF than native MOF. It was found that Schiff base mechanism between aldehyde as an active functional group in MOF and amine groups of enzyme led to the formation of imine bond. The surface chemical structure and morphologies of Fe-MIL-88(NH2) were characterized by FTIR, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), FE-SEM, and TEM.

Biochemical analysis demonstrated that SAPs could induce loose protein oligomerization via intermolecular hydrophobic interactions. Based on this mechanism, a comprehensive protein stabilization strategy was proposed, in which a library of stabilizing tags through random combination of different SAPs and linker peptides was developed to design the fusion composition while the sodium chloride (NaCl) was used to enhance the intermolecular hydrophobic interactions. By using the strategy, the PGL, lipoxygenase (LOX) and L-asparaginase exhibited 33.25-, 17.55- and 15.6-fold increases, respectively, in the t1/2 value relative to that of the corresponding wild-type enzyme.

     "abstract": "A novel low pH fermentation process was studied for the conversion of lactose using Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus buchneri under anoxic conditions in single co-culture, and two-stage sequential fermentations. This is aimed at producing acetate and propylene glycol (PG) as environmentally benign substitutes for currently used road and aircraft deicing chemicals. The results indicate that in the case of two-stage fermentation with immobilized L. buchneri in the second stage, lactose degradation rate increased markedly producing acetate and PG concentrations of 12.1 and 10.7 g L−1 at pH 3.8. In the case of coculture fermentation, the acetate and PG concentrations were 8.2 and 6.8 g L−1, respectively. Fermentation of lactose and whey powder was conducted at pH 4.25 using a high cell density culture of L. buchneri. The acetate and PG yields were similar for both substrates at ∼0.3 g/g and ∼0.33 g/g respectively. With a starting lactose concentration of 60 g/L, acetate and PG concentrations of 18 g/L and 21 g/L respectively were obtained. The low pH conversion of wastes to value-added products under anoxic conditions provides substantial operating benefits over neutral pH fermentations that require strict anaerobic conditions for effective operation. Moreover, the low product pH at around 4.0 will provide substantial savings in downstream processing costs due to the much higher extraction efficiency of weak- and moderate- base resins for acetic acid compared to acetate ion.",

AtXyl1 displays the highest activity at pH 5.5 and 55 °C and showed tolerance over a range of different phenolic compounds. The activity of AtXyl1 was not inhibited when the enzyme was incubated with ferulic acid (FA) using OSX or BrX as substrate. On the other hand, the incubation of AtXyl1 with BeX and FA resulted in an increase in enzyme activity. The molecular docking of a GH11 xylanase from Aspergillus niger with FA showed the preference for binding within the catalytic site. The position of FA was based on the presence or absence of a complexed substrate. When the enzyme from A. niger was docked in the absence of xylan in its crystal structure, FA interacted with Tyr164 and a water molecule. For the enzyme socked with xylo-oligosaccharides, FA interacted with Ser94, Tyr89 and the xylo-oligosaccharide present in the catalytic site. Thermodynamic parameters from the reaction of AtXyl1 with different xylans and FA indicate that FA can cause a conformational change in the enzyme, and this can influence the substrate fitting and makes the enzyme tolerant or active toward the substrate. Our findings suggest that enzyme activation or tolerance to phenolic compounds can be correlated to subtle changes in enzyme conformation due to the presence of the phenolic compound.",

Immobilization of the His-BirA was performed, realized to 92.85% using by 10 mM H2O2 without compromising catalytic activity. Because amounts of ions on matrix were far more than that of the immobilized BirA, EDTA should be used to remove residual ions before catalyzing, while it should be limited to lower than 30 mM, and imidazole ranging from 50 to 250 mM could be added in the catalytic system. When 10 mM EDTA and 50 mM imidazole were used, over 90% of substrates were obtained from the matrix. Moreover, the His-BirA showed higher immobilization rate than the BirA-His, while both of them appeared high catalytic abilities at pH ranging from 6.5 to 9.0, indicating versatile options in the biotinylation of proteins with different pH stabilities.

Biological fouling of membranes is a challenge that leads to increased costs from efficiency reductions, membrane damage and ultimately, membrane replacement over time. Such costs can be mitigated by monitoring and optimizing cleaning processes for better prognosis. Monitoring bacterial accumulation in situ can therefore advance understanding of cleaning efficiency. A fluorescence-based sensor for early biofouling detection capable of measuring extracellular enzyme activity was developed and tested in a lab-scale seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) biofouling model for use in monitoring bacterial accumulation proximal to the surface of a membrane. We tracked bacterial biomass accumulation rapidly and non-invasively using exogenously applied fluorogen-substrates and corroborated with optical coherence tomography imaging of the membrane surface in real-time. The selected fluorogen and fluorogen-substrate were characterized and down selected by high throughput screening in vitro for compatibility in seawater and profiled over relevant Red Sea desalination parameters (pH and temperature). This approach demonstrates the practicality of prototyping an early-detection biofouling sensor in membrane based processes, such as seawater desalination, using extracellular enzyme activity as a measure of bacterial abundance.",

     "abstract": "Enantiopure β-amino acids are essential precursors of various pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and other industrially important chemicals. In this study, we selected sixteen potential ω-Transaminases (ω-TAs) by BLAST and phylogenetic tree analysis. These ω-TAs were cloned, purified and tested for their reactivity for the synthesis of model β-amino acid (R)-3-amino-4-(2,4,5-triflurophenyl) butanoic acid [3-ATfBA], a key precursor for sitagliptin. In an enzymatic cascade, lipase converted β-ketoester substrate to β-keto acid, which was subsequently aminated by the selected ω-TA to its corresponding β-amino acid. A potent enzyme from Ilumatobacter coccineus (ω-TAIC) was identified for the production of 3-ATfBA. The pH dependency of the product inhibition suggested that lowering the reaction pH to 7.0 can circumvent the inhibition of ω-TAIC by 3-ATfBA and about 92.3% conversion of 100 mM β-keto ester substrate could be achieved. The applicability of this enzymatic system was further evaluated at the scale of 140 mM, wherein 3-ATfBA was generated with excellent conversion (81.9%) and enantioselectivity (99% ee). Furthermore, ω-TAIC was successfully used for the synthesis of various β-amino acids from their corresponding β-keto ester substrates.",

     "abstract": "Thiol dioxygenases are non-heme mononuclear-iron proteins and belong to the cupin superfamily. In 2014, mercaptosuccinate dioxygenase (Msdo) of Variovorax paradoxus B4 was identified as another bacterial cysteine dioxygenase (Cdo) homolog catalyzing the conversion of mercaptosuccinate (MS) into succinate and sulfite. To gain further insights into potentially important amino acid residues for enzyme activity, seven enzyme variants were generated and analyzed. (i) Three variants comprised the substitution of one conserved histidine residue each by leucine, either supposed to be mandatory for coordination of the Fe(II) cofactor (H93 and H95) or to be important for substrate positioning within the active site (H163). The corresponding enzyme variants were completely inactive confirming their essential roles for enzyme activity. (ii) Mutation C100S resulted as well in an inactive enzyme demonstrating its importance for either stability or activity of the protein. (iii) For eukaryotic Cdo, a hydrogen bond network for substrate positioning was postulated, and the corresponding amino acids are basically present in Msdo. Albeit the MsdoQ64A mutation exhibited an increased Km of 0.29 mM when compared to the wildtype with 0.06 mM, it did not significantly affect the specific activity. (iv) The variant MsdoR66A showed only very low activity even when high amounts of enzyme were applied indicating that this residue might be important for catalysis. (v) No strong effect had the mutation Y165F for which a specific enzyme activity of 10.22 μmol min−1 mg−1 protein and a Km value of 0.06 mM with high similarity to those of the wildtype enzyme were obtained. This residue corresponds to Y157 of human Cdo, which is part of the catalytic triad and is supposed to be involved in substrate positioning. Apparently, another residue could fulfill this role in Msdo, since the loss of Y165 did not have a strong effect.",

Extracellular glucansucrase of L. pseudomesenteroides DSM 20193 was selected from 19 glucansucrase positive Leuconostoc and Weissella strains. Kinetic analysis of the PEG-fractionated enzyme revealed a KM of 6.6 mM and a kcat of 2.6 s−1 for NDGA. Full-factorial design methodology was used to optimize conversion resulting in 95.5% total NDGA glucosides. In total 7 glucosides were detected by LC–MS ranging from mono- to triglucoside. The 4-O-α-D-monoglucoside and the symmetrical 4,4’-O-α-D-diglucoside were the major products in all biotransformations. Water solubility and half-life stability at 45 °C increased significantly in the order diglucoside > monoglucoside > aglycon. Analysis of cellular antioxidative capacity exhibited a time-dependent activity increase pointing towards glucoside hydrolysis. Accordingly, NDGA-glucosides impaired metastasis of triple negative breast cancer cells to the same degree as the aglycon with 35% reduction of cell migration by the mono- and 34% reduction by the diglucoside after 20 h.",

In absence of redox mediators, 40% decolorization efficiency was reached within 24 h at pH 4 for Congo Red and 80% for RBBR at pH 8.2 in 24 h. In presence of 10μM ABTS, it respectively attained 100% efficiency after 2h and 12h. We have also demonstrated that non-toxic species were generated upon dyes decolorization. These results show that unlike laccases, this new biocatalyst exhibits excellent decolorization properties over a wide range of pH. Beyond, this enzymatic-based heterogeneous catalyst can be reused during two months being simply stored at room temperature while maintaining its decolorization efficiency.

Two different enzymes, cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase) and amylosucrase (ASase), have the transglycosylation activity to produce EMIQ.

However, its melanogenic pathways remain unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that Bt BMB181 failed to produce melanin after treatment with mesotrione, an inhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase in the homogentisic acid pathway of melanin synthesis. Heterologous expression experiments suggested that homogentisate-1,2-dioxygenase (HmgA) in Bt BMB171 functions normally, yet HmgA in Bt BMB181 had lost its activity, at least partly. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, the hmgA gene in Bt BMB171 was knocked out and the mutant strain gained the ability to produce melanin. Furthermore, the complemented strain reverted to the wild-type phenotype. In addition, overexpression of its own hmgA gene in Bt BMB181 also resulted in failure to produce the pigment. BLAST results indicated that the amino acid alteration (G272E) in HmgA of Bt BMB181 was caused by a single point mutation (815G→ A). The enzyme activity of purified HmgA171 was more than 10-fold higher than that of HmgA181. Finally, we determined that the mutation in hmgA was responsible for melanin accumulation in Bt BMB181.

The optimization of cultivation conditions at shake flask resulted in ScUlp1 expression of 195 mg/L in TB medium with a specific product yield of 98 mg/g DCW. The leaky expression of the ScUlp1 protease was controlled using the chemically defined minimal medium. The Ni-NTA affinity purification of ScUlp1 was done near homogeneity using different additives (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01 mM DTT, 0.02 mM EDTA and 1% glycerol) where a product purity of ∼95% with a recovery yield of 80% was obtained. The specific activity of purified ScUlp1 was found to be 3.986 × 105 U/mg.

The separation of the two processes allowed the determination of the adsorption kinetics of the enzyme; the rate constants of the adsorption and desorption process were determined for the first time. Comparison of these constants to reaction rates showed that adsorption is not instantaneous and can be the rate-determining step.

At first, five medicinal plants were selected as potential sources for developing new ACE inhibitors through hydrolyzing hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine (HHL) assay. The interaction of selected extracts with immobilized ACE on the sensor chip (500D) confirmed that the Onopordum acanthium L. had the greatest ACE inhibition activity among the set of compounds and its active compound (onopordia) was isolated. SPR biosensor used to evaluate binding affinity of onopordia and ACE. Equilibrium constant (KD), and changes in Gibb's free energy of the binding (ΔGbinding) values for the interaction of onopordia with ACE were found to be 10.24 μM and -28.48 kJ/mol, respectively. Computational analysis supported the binding of onopordia to the ACE active site. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of binding revealed that onopordia is an acceptable ACE inhibitor and could treat hypertension.

     "abstract": "A sufficient supply of reducing equivalents is essential for obtaining the maximum yield of target products in anaerobic fermentation. The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex controls the critical step in pyruvate conversion to acetyl-CoA and NADH. However, in anaerobic Escherichia coli, PDH residing in the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (LPD) component is normally inactive due to inhibition by NADH. In this study, the protein engineering of LPD by structural analysis was explored to eliminate this inhibition. A novel IAA350/351/358VVV triple mutant was successfully verified to be more effective than other LPD mutants reported till date. Notably, PDH activity with the triple mutant at an [NADH]/[NAD+] ratio of 0.15 was still higher than that of the wild-type without NADH addition. The altered enzyme of the PDH complex was also active in the presence of such high NADH levels. This is the first study concerning protein engineering of PDH by structure-guided design. The presence and functional activity of such an NADH-insensitive PDH complex provides a useful metabolic element for fermentation products and has potential for biotechnological application.",

This method is, however, not suitable for alkaline sensitive materials, which have poor stability in alkali medium and need over-long reaction time. Herein, we compared two dopamine polymerization methods: conventional method (induced by O2 at pH 8.5) and laccase-catalyzed method (at pH 5.5). The comparison showed that the polymerization of dopamine was greatly improved when catalyzed by laccase. The PDA film obtained from laccase-catalyzed method was more uniform and more stable compared with that obtained from the conventional method; the film was able to further react with amine-terminated molecules. As a result of laccase, ether bonds were found between dopamine units of PDA; while such bonds were not observed in film obtained from the conventional method. This work can be a basis for a better understanding of structure and property relationships of PDA coating.",

Nowadays, Penicillin G acylase (PGA) has been widely applied for making pharmaceutical intermediates, while penicillin V acylase (PVA) has been less used for that due to its low activity and poor conversion. In this study, a PVA from Bacillus sphaericus (BspPVA) was employed for directed evolution study with hoping to increase its catalytic efficiency. Finally, a triple mutant BspPVA-3 (T63S/N198Y/S110C) was obtained with 12.4-fold specific activity and 11.3-fold catalytic efficiency higher than BspPVA-wt (wild type of BspPVA). Moreover, the conversion yields of 6-APA catalyzed by BspPVA-3 reached 98% with 20% (w/v) penicillin V as substrate, which was significantly higher than that of the BspPVA-wt (85%). Based on the analysis of modeling, the enhancement of specific activity of mutant BspPVA-3 was probably attributed to the changes in the number of hydrogen bonds within the molecules.

Dilution of the samples, which is necessary to measure within the linear range of the spectrophotometer, is time-consuming and not compatible with high-throughput applications. Here we present a direct approach to estimate the OD at 578 nm (OD578) of bacterial cultures in microplates without the need for sample dilution. This could be advantageous for high-throughput analysis of bacterial cells in microplates for example when optimizing growth conditions, screening for new substrates of a bacterial strain or monitoring enzymatic activity after enzyme evolution. Pseudomonas putida cells were grown in shake flasks. The OD578 was determined in parallel in a microplate directly without dilution and in a spectrophotometer cuvette after dilution. The resulting data set was used to identify a conversion formula, which enables direct and reliable transformation of OD measurements of undiluted samples into the corrected OD values as would have been obtained for diluted samples measured in a standard spectrophotometer.Subsequently we could show that just a few OD calibration points are required to adjust this conversion formula and make it suitable for other suspensions or cultures of bacterial strains different than P. putida. The OD calibration points can be obtained by any combination of microplate reader and cuvette spectrophotometer. For this purpose, conversion formulas for a formazine standard suspension and a suspension of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were successfully generated. The OD values calculated by both conversion formulas turned out to be identical with the values as obtained by the control measurements in the spectrophotometer. This indicates the general applicability of the conversion formula as described.",

In this study, we demonstrated that the unpaired cysteine residues in Npu DnaE tend to form disulfide bonds, and contributed to the reduction of the cleavage under non-reducing conditions. This redox trap can be disrupted by site-directed mutation of these unpaired cysteines.

     "abstract": "Manganese superoxide dismutase from Staphylococcus equorum (MnSODSeq) maintains its activity after up to 45 minutes of UVC radiation. The enzyme occurs in a dimeric form that likely contributes to its activity and stability. Therefore, maintaining the dimeric form could be a way to improve the enzyme’s stability. One of the main interactions for dimer formation occurs between Tyr168 and His31, of which the latter is also involved in the enzymatic reaction. UVC radiation may cause alterations in the electronic structure of the phenolic ring in the Tyr168 side chain: this may disrupt the Tyr168-His31 pairing and lead to enzyme instability and/or activity loss. In this report, a Leu169Trp substitution was carried out to protect the Tyr168 residue by introducing an amino acid with an aromatic side chain for better photon absorption of the UV light. Interestingly, although the substitution appeared to have a minor effect on enzyme stability and activity upon UVC irradiation, the melting temperature (TM) of the Leu169Trp mutant was different. Unlike the native protein, the TM of the mutant had not changed after UV irradiation. Thus, our effort to extend the resistance to UVC radiation was not successful, but we have discovered a biologically active new form. The present finding provides evidence that MnSODSeq maintains most of its activity and resistance to UVC irradiation as long as the dimer and its glutamate-bridge are intact, despite an alteration that destabilizes its monomeric structure. The present finding further unravels the relationship between the structure of the enzyme and its activity. Furthermore, the results may provide further insight in how to modify the enzyme to improve its characteristics for application in medicine or cosmetics.",

The trypsin activation and α-amylase inhibition were analyzed precisely by enzyme kinetics. The former was solely dependent on increase in the molecular activity kcat without any change in the Michaelis constant Km, and the latter was mainly dependent on decrease in Km with a slight change in kcat. Effects of the treatments of U3EE with freezing-and-thawing, heat, acid, and hexane were examined. The treated U3EE showed the effects on the enzymes with the same potencies as those provided by the non-treated one, indicating that U3EE was enough stable toward the harsh treatments to hold the modulating effects on the enzyme activities. U3EE was also shown to be highly hydrophilic. The results obtained in this paper suggested that U3EE could be applicable as a novel constituent for pharmaceuticals and functional foods.",

The results showed that the apparent CO2 fixation efficiency of A. hydrogenophilus was significantly influenced by the electron donor (H2), and the degree of electron donor oxidization was responsible for the variation in apparent CO2 fixation efficiency. Furthermore, transcription efficiency of the cbbL gene at low electron donor concentration was lower than that at high electron donor concentration, but excessive electron donor concentrations did not further increase cbbL gene transcription efficiency significantly. High oxygen concentration was not advantageous to cbbL gene transcription efficiency in A. hydrogenophilus, but could improve cell growth rate (protein synthesis rate) and apparent CO2 fixation efficiency, implying that cytoskeleton synthesis efficiency is another important factor determining apparent CO2 fixation efficiency and its contribution maybe greater than that of cbbL transcription.

PEG 6000 was shortlisted as the best additive as it could simultaneously enhance saccharification and overall cellulase recoveries namely cellobiohydrolase, endoglucanase and cellobiase. Addition of 0.3 g PEG 6000/g acid-insoluble lignin content, resulted in 55% and 49.2% saccharification yields in terms of reducing sugars and glucose respectively using this cellulase cocktail (25 mg protein/g cellulose content) after 72 h from acid pretreated sugarcane bagasse loaded at 7.5%.

It can be produced chemically, through the ring-opening of butyrolactone followed by hydrolysis. Alternatively, glutaric acid can be produced via lysine degradation pathways by microorganisms. In microorganisms, the overexpression of enzymes involved in this pathway from E. coli and C. glutamicum has resulted in high accumulation of 5-aminovaleric acid. However, the conversion from 5-aminovaleric acid to glutaric acid has resulted in a relatively low conversion yield for unknown reasons. In this study, as a solution to improve the production of glutaric acid, we introduced gabTD genes from B. subtilis to E. coli for a whole cell biocatalytic approach. This approach enabled us to determine the effect of co-factors on reaction and to achieve a high conversion yield from 5-aminovaleric acid at the optimized reaction condition. Optimization of whole cell reaction by different plasmids, pH, temperature, substrate concentration, and cofactor concentration achieved full conversion with 100 mM of 5-aminovaleric acid to glutaric acid.

ISHI-3 comprised Herbivorax saccincola and bacteria belonging to the classes Pelotomaculum, Tepidanaerobacter, and Tepidimicrobium, as determined by DGGE of the PCR-generated 16S rRNA genes. Furthermore, metagenomics analysis using a 16S rRNA library was carried out to determine the bacterial distribution during degradation of CS and RS. H. saccincola and bacteria belonging to Pelotomaculum were relatively abundant in the beginning to middle periods of culture with CS and RS whereas bacteria belonging to Tepidanaerobacter and Tepidimicrobium gradually increased in the population during the later stages. To understand the role of non-cellulolytic bacteria in the consortium, novel strains ET1 and GL4, which were most closely related to Tepidimicrobium ferriphilum and Tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans, were isolated from ISHI-3. Based on their carbon source usage, morphology, and phylogenetic analysis, we propose that strains ET1 and GL4 should be classified as a novel genus or species. Bacteria ET1 and GL4 can utilize different organic compounds as carbon and energy sources such as organic acids, alcohols, sugars, and amino acids, showing a preference for organic acids and alcohols rather than sugars such as glucose and cellobiose.

In this study, three Abf62A-Axe6A derivatives were constructed, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and biochemically characterized: RjAbf62A-Axe6A, containing all four modules but lacking the signal peptide; RjAbf62A-CBM6, containing the GH62 and CBM6 modules; and RjAxe6A, containing only CE6. RjAbf62A-Axe6A was highly active toward arabinoxylan and moderately active toward sugar beet arabinan, and released mainly arabinose. Analysis of the arabinoxylooligosaccharide hydrolysis products revealed that RjAbf62A-Axe6A released α-1,2- and α-1,3-linked arabinofuranose from both singly and doubly substituted xylosyl residues. Furthermore, RjAbf62A-Axe6A exhibited a weak activity toward linear 1,5-α-l arabinan and arabinooligosaccharides, indicating that it is capable of cleaving α-1,5-linkage. Surprisingly, RjAbf62A-Axe6A also demonstrated an endoxylanase activity toward birchwood and beechwood xylans and xylooligosaccharides. Although RjAbf62A-CBM6 exhibited a similar substrate specificity to RjAbf62A-Axe6A, RjAbf62A-CBM6 showed lower activities toward soluble arabinoxylans, birchwood and beechwood xylans and arabinoxylooligosaccharides but not toward insoluble arabinoxylan. RjAbf62A-Axe6A is the first reported GH62 enzyme with α-l-arabinofuranosidase and endoxylanase activities. Although both RjAbf62A-Axe6A and RjAxe6A had acetylxylan esterase activities, RjAbf62A-Axe6 exhibited a higher activity toward insoluble wheat arabinoxylan compared with RjAxe6.",

However, when heterologously expressed, genes in the same operon are usually not equally expressed, and the ratio needs to be fine-tuned. A gene cluster of three genes (corresponding to α-subunit, β-subunit and activator) encoding the nitrile hydratase was cloned from Aurantimonas manganoxydans ATCC BAA-1229 and expressed in Escherichia coli. However, difficulty was encountered in heterologous expression of the activator and the expression level of β-subunit was lower than that of α-subunit, which together resulted in low catalytic efficiency. To improve the expression of activator, a set of SKIK tags were fused to the N-terminus of the activator. To elevate the expression level of β-subunit, a silent mutation strategy was applied in the overlapping sequence with α-subunit around its translation initial region. Finally, the expression of β-subunit and activator were improved and the maximum activity of NHase1229 was doubled, reaching 160 U/mL towards 3-cyanopyridine. These results indicate that N-terminal engineering is an efficient strategy for optimizing the expression of multiple genes in operons.",

To investigate the potential effects of the pgi deletion/higher plasmid levels on recombinant human Interferon Gamma (IFN-γ) production, a detailed network of the central metabolic pathway (100 metabolites, 114 reactions) of GALG20 and MG1655 was constructed. Elementary mode analysis (EMA) was then performed to compare the phenotypic spaces of both the strains and to check the effect of the pgi deletion on flux efficiency of each metabolic reaction. The results suggested that pgi deletion increases amino acid biosynthesis and flux efficiency towards IFN-γ synthesis by 11%. To further confirm the qualitative prediction that the pgi mutation favours recombinant human IFN-γ expression, GALG20 and MG1655 were lysogenised, transformed with a plasmid coding for IFN-γ and tested alongside with BL21(DE3) for their expression capabilities in shake flask experiments using complex media. IFN-γ gene expression was analysed by quantifying plasmid and mRNA copy number per cell and IFN-γ protein production level. Specific IFN-γ yields confirmed the in silico metabolic network predictions, with GALG20(DE3) producing 3.0-fold and 1.5-fold more IFN-γ as compared to MG1655(DE3) and BL21(DE3), respectively. Most of the total IFN-γ was expressed as inclusion bodies across the three strains: 95% in GALG20(DE3), 97% in BL21(DE3) and 72% in MG1655(DE3). The copy number of mRNA coding for IFN-γ was found to be higher in GALG20(DE3) as compared to the other two strains.

Elucidation of glycan structure and biological function is critical to understand their role in physiological and pathogenic process, enabling the development of diagnostic methods and disease treatment. Immobilized glycosidases are powerful tools for glycan analysis, as they are able to remove specific carbohydrates without altering the protein structure. Here we describe the individual immobilization of Aspergillus oryzae β-galactosidase and Canavalia ensiformis α-mannosidase onto agarose and silica magnetic nanoparticles activated with cyanate ester groups. High immobilization yields (70–90%) were achieved, keeping above 60% of its original activity. Immobilized glycosidases were effective in the selective deglycosylation of model glycoproteins and a Fasciola hepatica lysate, evidenced by a decrease in specific lectin recognition of 40–50% after enzymatic deglycosylation. Immobilized glycosidases were reused for several deglycosylation cycles without loss of effectiveness. Their use was extended to the elucidation of the glycan role of native glycoconjugates. A decrease in the recognition of lactoferrin treated with α-mannosidase by a C-type lectin receptor, DC-SIGN was found. Also the specific deglycosylation of a F. hepatica lysate demonstrated the relevance of mannosylated glycans in the induction of Th2/Treg immune responses during the infection. Our results show successful immobilization of specific glycosidases in nano-supports and validate their utility to identify glycans biological functions.",

MAS1-H108A was first immobilized onto ECR1030 resin. Results showed that the lipase/support ratio of 41 mg/g was suitable for the immobilization and the thermostability of immobilized MAS1-H108A was greatly enhanced.

First, PLP present in plasma samples is allowed to reconstitute apo-d-PhgAT, forming active holo-d-PhgAT. In the second step, the enzymatic activity of reconstituted d-PhgAT is determined using d-4-OH-phenylglycine as the amino donor substrate with 4-OH-benzoylformate (OH-BZF) as the reaction product. OH-BZF absorbs UV light strongly at 334 nm (molar absorption coefficient = 25.4 × 103 M−1cm−1) and its rate of formation is monitored spectrophotometrically. The rate of the transamination reaction catalyzed by the reconstituted d-PhgAT is directly proportional to the amount of PLP in the sample. The method is applicable for determining PLP in the concentration range from 5.2 to 250 nM and requires 50 μL of plasma sample. The mean within- and between-run coefficient of variations (CVs) were 8.1% and 12.4%, respectively. Analytical recoveries ranged from 98 to 108%. The assay was specific and showed good correlation with the established method (CDC, Method No: 4002.05). The assay requires one reaction catalyzed by a single enzyme, does not require a radioactive substrate, and a derivatization reagent is not needed. This PLP determination process is relatively simple to perform and can be completed using common laboratory equipment.",

Synthesized ZnO nanoparticles were characterized using UV–vis spectroscopy, XRD, SEM, and EDX analyses. The XRD and SEM analyses showed 45–60 nm as the size of synthesized nanoparticles, the pure crystal form of ZnO NPs, and the shape of the NPs as nearly spherical and hexagonal quartzite. The antioxidant potential of nanoparticles was estimated using a DPPH free radical scavenging assay. The percent of viable cells was inversely proportional to the concentration of ZnO nanoparticles at 25 μg/mL concentration. The MTT assay used for cytotoxicity evaluation depicted the significant cytotoxic effect of ZnO NPs against the A549 lung cancer cell line. The drop in the proportion of viable A549 cells after exposure to ZnO NPs was comparable to the effects of the standard drug used i.e. cyclophosphamide.

     "abstract": "Cells of Escherichia coli Rosetta, containing plasmid pET-28a with sequences of DNA of chitinase from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia N4, were used for the efficient synthesis of recombinant chitinolytic enzyme. The objective of this study was to improve thermal stability of the recombinant chitinase by salts and metal nanoparticles (NP). The studied chitinase was thermolabile and largely lost its activity in the first minutes of storage at 50 and 60 °C. The optimum temperature for colloidal chitin hydrolysis by the enzyme was 50 °C. Application of sodium aurothiomalate hydrate and manganese chloride enhanced the activity of the recombinant enzyme. In general, chitinase activity was higher when silver nanoparticles (Ag-NP) were used, but lower for other NP. The thermal stability of chitinase immobilized on Ag-NP and manganese chloride was significantly higher than that of free chitinase. Chitinase thermal stability after gold and manganese oxide nanoparticle application was higher than that of the control at 50 °C. Platinum nanoparticles had no significant effect on thermostability. The Ag-NP had a smaller diameter (from 2 to 20 nm) than Au-NP (from 5 to 70 nm) and Pt-NP (from 4 to 80 nm). The TEM analysis showed that the used NP had a higher affinity for chitinase than for the synthetic substrate. The type, size, and location of the NP on the enzyme played a major role in the thermal stability of chitinase.",

These properties are highly dependent on the surface chemistry and thus, the effect of functionalization has been widely studied for different applications. Meanwhile, the influence of CB functionalization over its properties for electroanalytical applications is still being poorly explored. In this study, we describe the use of chemically functionalized CB Vulcan XC 72R for the development of sensitive electrochemical biosensors. The chemical pre-treatment increased the material wettability by raising the concentration of surface oxygenated functional groups verified from elemental analysis and FTIR measurements. In addition, it was observed an enhancement of almost 100-fold on the electron transfer rate constant (k0) related to unfunctionalized CB, confirming a remarkable improvement of the electrocatalytic properties. Finally, we constructed a Tyrosinase (Tyr) biosensor based on functionalized CB and dihexadecylphosphate (DHP) for the determination of catechol in water samples. The resulting device displayed an excellent stability with a limit of detection of 8.7 × 10−8 mol L−1 and a sensitivity of 539 mA mol−1 L.

Here, we examine the influence on this radical formation of mediators which are presumed to act by shuttling electrons between the laccase and the subunits in lignin that the enzyme cannot approach directly. Treatments of three different lignins with laccase-mediator-systems (LMS) including laccases derived from Trametes versicolor and Myceliophthora thermophila, respectively, and four individual mediators, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT), N-hydroxyphthalimide (HPI), 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yloxy (TEMPO), and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) were assessed by real time electron paramagnetic resonance measurements. Radical steady state concentrations and radical formation rates were quantified. LMS treatments with 500 μM N-OH type mediators (HPI or HBT) did not affect the lignin radical formation, but increased doses of those mediators (5 mM) surprisingly led to significantly decreased radical formation rates and lowered steady state radical concentrations. Laccase-TEMPO treatment at a 5 mM mediator dose was the only system that significantly increased steady state radical concentration and rate of radical formation in beech organosolv lignin. The data suggest that electron shuttling by mediators is not a significant general mechanism for enhancing laccase catalyzed oxidation of biorefinery lignin substrates, and the results thus provide a new view on laccase catalyzed lignin modification.",

The morphological, structural and functional characterization of the neutral red incorporated, Al-doped ZnO (NR-AZO) film was carried out using electron microscopy, FTIR, XRD and EIS respectively. The incorporated neutral red was found to induce strain in the crystal of AZO proportional to the concentration used in depositing solution which further affected the charge transfer resistance of the films in solution. One mM neutral red was found to be the optimum concentration for both conductivity and response to NADH/NADPH. The response of the films was further validated by immobilizing NAD+ dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and NADP+ dependent glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) independently. The ADH/NR-AZO showed a sensitivity of 3.2 μA cm−2 mM−1 with a LoD of 1.7 μM of ethanol in the range 5.6 μM–7 mM, whereas GDH/NR-AZO showed a sensitivity of 4.33 μA cm−2 mM−1 with a LoD of 27 μM of glucose in the range 90 μM–4 mM.

The assay relied on an enzymatic transamination of AKG and d-4-hydroxyphenylglycine to form 4-hydroxybenzoylformic acid and l-glutamic acid using d-phenylglycine aminotransferase. Since 4-hydroxybenzoylformic acid absorbed UV strongly at 334 nm, the initial rate of the reaction was determined by the increasing absorbance at this wavelength without the need for colorimetric probes or coupling reactions, and this information was used for the construction of a standard curve against AKG concentration. The method showed good linearity (r2 = 0.9994) over an AKG concentration range of 20–160 μM. The limits of detection and quantitation were 4.09 and 13.62 μM respectively. It was simple, inexpensive, accurate and precise, as well as repeatable, and was not interfered with by excipients in the samples. Regarding the environmental friendliness, the method was free from the use of organic solvents or hazardous reagents and required no chemical pre-treatment of samples. The proposed method gave assay results tested in real samples in agreement with the HPLC method and commercial assay kits, therefore being suitable for routine analysis of AKG in quality control laboratories.",

In our previous study, l-isoleucine (Ile) dioxygenase gene ido was overexpressed in an Ile-producing Corynebacterium glutamicum strain, and 4-HIL was de novo synthesized from glucose. In this study, to increase the NADPH supply, the endogenous NAD+ kinase gene ppnK and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase gene zwf were co-expressed with ido.

However, the strain SL02 co-expressing exogenous NADH kinase gene POS5 with ido grew slowly and its 4-HIL production decreased by 12%, perhaps due to the lower 2-oxoglutarate (OG) level and slightly weaker membrane permeability. To increase OG availability for 4-HIL conversion, the serine/threonine protein kinase G gene pknG was deleted and replaced by ido gene in SL02. The growth of the resulting strain SL04 was restored and 4-HIL production was improved to 84.14 ± 6.38 mM; meanwhile, the conversion ratio of Ile to 4-HIL reached up to 0.98 ± 0.01 mol/mol.

To address these issues, we investigated the effect of nitrogen supply on the cellular growth and the Fab productivity. We used the anti-human VEGF-A Fab as a model that exhibited poor expression at 37 °C regardless of the amount of nitrogen supplied during fermentation. In stark contrast, the expression yield of soluble Fab with a gross nitrogen supply of 6.91 g/L of broth throughout the fermentation at 25 °C was 332 mg/L. Furthermore, and increased nitrogen supply of 10.9 g/L significantly improved the yield of active form by 59.7% and the cellular growth rate by 39.3%.

These two type III PKS genes from Sordaria macrospora (SmPKS) and Chaetomium thermophilum (CtPKS), shared 59.8% sequence identity. Both, full-length and truncated versions of type III PKSs were successfully cloned and overexpressed in a bacterial host, Escherichia Coli BL21 (DE3) using a N-terminus hexa-histidine tag. The full-length and the truncated construct of PKSs showed similar activity profiles, suggesting that additional amino acid residues at the C-terminal of both SmPKS and CtPKS may not be involved in catalytic functions. We demonstrate that these two recombinant polyketide synthases could efficiently synthesize tri- and tetraketide pyrones, resorcinols and resorcylic acids using various acyl-CoAs (C4–C20) as starter units. The truncated S. macrospora polyketide synthases (TrSmPKS) showed a maximum of 7.0 × 104 s−1 M−1 catalytic efficiency towards stearoyl-CoA.Whereas, truncated C. thermophilum polyketide synthases (TrCtPKS) preferred the long-chain acyl-CoA starter arachidoyl-CoA, to produce pentaketide and hexaketide resorcinols with a high catalytic efficiency of 6.2 × 104 s−1 M−1. Homology model and substrate docking analyses suggest a shorter distance between sulfur of catalytic Cys152 and thioester carbonyl group of arachidoyl-CoA as well as stronger imidazolium–thiolate ion pair distance in TrCtPKS between catalytic Cys152-His309 compared to TrSmPKS- arachidoyl CoA complex. Enhanced binding interactions of CtPKS residues forming intermolecular contacts at the active site could be attributed to its high specificity towards arachidoyl-CoA. This study reports the functional characterization of two fungal type III polyketide synthases, SmPKS and CtPKS with high catalytic efficiency from S. macrospora and C. thermophilum respectively.

In this study, we investigated the effect of two OM c-Cyts (MtrC and UndA) of Shewanella putrefaciens CN32 with respect to electricity production and anodic EET efficiency. Deletion of the mtrC gene severely prolonged the microbial fuel cell (MFC) start-up time and decreased electricity production due to depressed flavin-mediated electron transfer, whereas deletion of the undA gene did not have a significant impact. Strikingly, the depression of EET by the deletion of mtrC could be partially relieved by acclimation, which might be due to an increase in the transmembrane transport of electron shuttles and/or the activation of other redox proteins. These results suggested that MtrC may be the primary reductase of flavins to ensure fast indirect EET, which plays a crucial role in MFC electricity generation.",

As ELPs could bond to the xylanase-lichenase chimera through SpyTag/SpyCatcher spontaneous reaction in mild condition, which would lead to the formation of a 3-arm star multifunctional chimera. We purified the xylanase-lichenase by the non-chromatographic purification tag of ELPs. Interestingly, 57.5% of the xylanase and 47.2% of the lichenase in chimera self-assembled into insoluble active particles during the process of purification, which could serve as immobilized bifunctional enzymes. Notably, the immobilized chimera xylanase-lichenase showed a remarkable stability even after 10 reaction cycles, which retained around 56% (lichenase) and 44% (xylanase) of their initial activities, respectively. Moreover, the enhanced thermostability of the immobilized enzymes was also achieved. After incubating at 60 °C for 60 min, the residual activity of the immobilized lichenase was 35%, while the free one was only 24%. Unexpectedly, the free xylanase almost lost its activity when incubated at 55 °C for 60 min, whereas the immobilized xylanase retained 10% of its activity. However, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the free xylanase was 1.7-fold higher than the immobilized one, while the free lichenase was 1.1-fold higher than the immobilized one. This is among the first known reports that two enzymes are purified and immobilized in one-step. This novel strategy is easy to scale up and may meet the demands of biofuel industry.

The current work exploits structural differences between the two enzymes with the aim of engineering BbAfcB into a more efficient transfucosidase and approaches an understanding of structure-function relations of hydrolytic activity vs. transfucosylation activity in GH29. Replacement of a 23 amino acids long α-helical loop close to the active site of BbAfcB with the corresponding 17-aminoacid α-helical loop of CpAfc2 resulted in almost complete abolishment of the hydrolytic activity on 3FL (6000 times lower hydrolytic activity than WT BbAfcB), while the transfucosylation activity was lowered only one order of magnitude. In turn, the loop engineering resulted in an α-1,3/4-l-fucosidase with transfucosylation activity reaching molar yields of LNFP II of 39 ± 2% on 3FL and negligible product hydrolysis. This was almost 3 times higher than the yield obtained with WT BbAfcB (14 ± 0.3%) and comparable to that obtained with CpAfc2 (50 ± 8%).

     "abstract": "Fumarases have been successfully applied in industry for the production of l-malate. However, the industrialization of fumarases is limited by their low thermostability. In this study, the thermostability of fumarase C from Corynebacterium glutamicum was enhanced through directed evolution, simulated mutagenesis, site-directed mutagenesis and saturated mutagenesis. Mutant 2G (A411V) was initially constructed through directed evolution. Its half-life at 50 °C (t1/2, 50°C) increased from 1 min to 2.2 min, and the T5015 (temperature at which the activity of enzyme decreased by 50% in 15 min) increased from 44.8 °C to 47.2 °C. Besides, several different mutants were obtained by site-directed mutation. Among them, mutant 3G (A227V) showed significant improvement in thermostability with a 3.3-fold improvement of t1/2, 50°C and a 3.6 °C increase in T5015 compared to the wild-type enzyme. Then, 2/3G (A227V, A411V) was obtained by combining the mutant 2G with the mutant 3G, for which the t1/2, 50°C and T5015 increased to more than 768 min and 52.4 °C, respectively. Finally, site-saturated mutagenesis was employed on amino acid residues 175-Glu, 228-Gly, 297-Gly, 320-Lys and 464-Glu to maximize the thermostability of mutant 2/3G. The most thermostable mutant 175G with amino acid substitutions (A227V, A411V, E175K) was isolated. Its t1/2,50°C increased to more than 2700 min while that of wild-type enzyme was only 1 min and T5015 was 9.8 °C higher than the wild-type enzyme. The thermostable mutated enzymes generated without affecting the activity in this study would be an attractive candidate for industrial applications.",

Clostridium thermocellum is a naturally ideal cellulose degrading bacterium armed with cellulosomes, which are multienzyme complexes that are capable of efficiently degrading cellulose. However, under controlled condition, the inhibition effect of hydrolysate cellobiose severely restricts the hydrolytic ability of cellulosomes. Although the addition of beta-glucosidase (Bgl) could effectively relieve this inhibition, the spatial proximity effect of Bgl and cellulosomes on cellulose degradation is still unclear. To address this issue, free Bgl from Caldicellulosiruptor sp. F32 (CaBglA), carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) fused CaBglA (CaBglA-CBM) and cellulosomal type II cohesin module (CohII) fused to CaBglA (CaBglA-CohII) were successfully constructed, and their enzymatic activities, binding abilities and saccharification efficiencies were systematically investigated in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, with the adjacency of CaBglA to cellulosomes, the saccharification efficiency of microcrystalline cellulose increased from 40% to 50%. For the pretreated wheat straw, the degradation rate of the combination of cells and the CaBglA-CohII or the CaBglA-CBM was as efficient as that of the free CaBglA (approximately 60%). This study demonstrated that the proximity of CaBglA to cellulosomes had a positive effect on microcrystalline cellulose but not on pretreated wheat straw, which may result from the nonproductive adsorption of lignin and the decreased thermostability of CaBglA-CBM and CaBglA-CohII compared to that of CaBglA. The above results will contribute to the design of cost-effective Bgls for industrial cellulose degradation.",

This resulted in four metagenomic TS-like fragments with broad sequence diversity (41−67% identity to each other). The encoded open reading frames were used as templates for further in silico screening. Two trehalose synthases were discovered using this novel approach and their enzymatic properties were further investigated.

H2O2 promotes a rapid inactivation of the immobilized enzyme. At first glance, co-immobilization of DAO and catalase (CAT) could improve the elimination of the released hydrogen peroxide. Two different co-immobilized derivatives were prepared: (a) both enzymes co-localized and homogeneously distributed across the whole structure of a porous support, and (b) both enzymes we de-localized inside the porous support: DAO immobilized on the outer part of the porous support and catalase immobilized in the inner part. Co-localized derivatives were seven-fold more effective than de-localized ones for the elimination of hydrogen peroxide inside the porous support. In addition to that, the degradation of putrescine by DAO was three-fold more rapid when using both co-localized enzymes. The optimal co-localized derivative (containing 1.25 mg of DAO plus 25 mg of CAT per g of support) promoted the instantaneous elimination of 91% H2O2 released inside the porous support during putrescine oxidation. This optimal derivative preserves 92% of activity after three reaction cycles and DAO immobilized without catalase only preserves 41% of activity. Co-localization seems to be the key strategy to immobilize two sequential enzymes. When enzymes are immobilized in close proximity to each other in a co-localized pattern, the generation of byproducts as H2O2 is strongly reduced.",

Combining with the carboxyl esterase (MekB) protein sequence alignment, two target genes (the cg0961 and cg0754) were selected for the CRISPRi application to investigate the possible native esterase in C. glutamicum. The recombinant strain with repressed expression of the cg0961 gene exhibited almost no capability on degradation of methyl acetate as a substrate of carboxyl esterase.

Air oxygen can be detected within 30 min under optimized condition. The smallest amount of oxygen that can be detected with acceptable response time (120 min) is 5%.

The stability of three lipases, Candida sp., Candida rugosa and Burkholderia cepacia, in miniemulsions during polyester synthesis, was accessed through the secondary structure integrities and activities in order to establish any putative correlations between secondary structure and activity. The effect of the individual components that constitute the emulsion system was also evaluated to identify those which are more disruptive to the secondary structure-function of the enzyme. Depending on the lipase and the presence of different reaction components, three scenarios were observed: a close correlation between secondary structural changes and activity, a drop in activity with no secondary structure alterations but unfolding of tertiary structure and disruption of secondary structure that allows regain of activity in the presence of substrate.",

Therefore, a modified TcPAM with high β-selectivity is expected. Based on the catalytic mechanism and structure, two amino acid residues (Asn458 and Leu108) in active sites were identified as the key residues for controlling the regioselective hydroamination of t-CA and as promising candidates for mutagenesis to enhance β-selectivity and decrease α-selectivity. The Asn458 and Leu108 residues were mutated to yield variant TcPAM-Asn458Phe/Leu108Glu, and the β-selectivity was approximately 5.2-fold higher than that of wild-type TcPAM, while α-selectivity decreased to 68%, and the percentage of β-phe in the product mixture increased from 42% to 83%. In addition, the mutant was applied to synthesize β-arylalanines using substituent t-CA as a substrate. The regioselectivity was also affected by the substituent groups at the phenyl ring of t-CA with respect to their electronic properties and position, and the 4-methoxy and methyl substituent t-CA were transferred into β-arylalanines.

Thus, RS223-BX is strongly activated by divalent-metal cations and the previously published X-ray structure of this enzyme shows that a Ca2+ cation is chelated by an active-site Asp carboxyl group and an active-site His.

For the other enzyme (BoXA), mutation to Ala causes 20% loss of activity for the His mutant and 40% gain of activity for the Asp mutant, indicating the lack of importance for activity of the native residues and the lack of metal-dependency, given that the Asp residue occupies the active site to secure the metal cation in known metal ion dependent GH43 xylosidases.

Results indicate that the absence of the lid loop seems not to be the sole structural feature responsible for the recognition of a polymeric substrate by GGTs.

Further, among the flavonoids, quercetin is the most favorable substrate, followed by luteolin, myricetin, quercetin 3-O-β-D-glucoside, and fisetin, while only a single product was formed in each case. The products were confirmed by HPLC and mass-spectrometry analyses. A detailed NMR spectrometric analysis of the methylated quercetin and luteolin derivatives confirmed the regiospecific methylation at the 4′-OH position. Modeling and molecular docking provided further insight regarding the most favorable mechanism and substrate architecture for the enzymatic catalysis. Accordingly, a double bond between the C2 and the C3 and a single-ring-appended conjugate-hydroxyl group are crucial for the favorable enzymatic conversions of the GerMIII catalysis. Thus, in this study, the enzymatic properties of GerMIII and a mechanistic overview of the regiospecific modification that was implemented for the acceptance of quercetin as the most favorable substrate are presented.",

The use of self-sufficient P450 s with fused haem and reductase domains has already contributed heavily to improving catalytic efficiency and simplifying an otherwise more complex multi-component system of P450 and redox partners. Herein, we present a new addition to the class VII family with the cloning, sequencing and characterisation of the self-sufficient CYP116B62 Hal1 from Halomonas sp. NCIMB 172, the genome of which has not yet been sequenced. Hal1 exhibits high levels of expression in a recombinant E. coli host and can be utilised from cell lysate or used in purified form. Hal1 favours NADPH as electron donor and displays a diverse range of activities including hydroxylation, demethylation and sulfoxidation. These properties make Hal1 suitable for future biocatalytic applications or as a template for optimisation through engineering.",

As proof of principle we identified over 70 putative biomass degrading genes from bacterium Cellulomonas fimi, expressing a subset of these in BioBrick format. Six novel genes showed activity in E. coli. Four interesting enzymes were characterised further. α-l-arabinofuranosidase AfsB, β-xylosidases BxyF and BxyH and multi-functional β-cellobiosidase/xylosidase XynF were partially purified to determine their optimum pH, temperature and kinetic parameters. One of these enzymes, BxyH, was unexpectedly found to be highly active at strong alkaline pH and at temperatures as high as 100 °C.

     "abstract": "The aim of this work was to develop a simple and accurate protocol to measure the functional active site concentration of lipases immobilised on highly hydrophobic supports. We used the potent lipase inhibitor methyl 4-methylumbelliferyl hexylphosphonate to titrate the active sites of Candida rugosa lipase (CrL) bound to three highly hydrophobic supports: octadecyl methacrylate (C18), divinylbenzene crosslinked methacrylate (DVB) and styrene. The method uses correction curves to take into account the binding of the fluorophore (4-methylumbelliferone, 4-MU) by the support materials. We showed that the uptake of the detection agent by the three supports is not linear relative to the weight of the resin, and that the uptake occurs in an equilibrium that is independent of the total fluorophore concentration. Furthermore, the percentage of bound fluorophore varied among the supports, with 50 mg of C18 and styrene resins binding approximately 64 and 94%, respectively. When the uptake of 4-MU was calculated and corrected for, the total 4-MU released via inhibition (i.e. the concentration of functional lipase active sites) could be determined via a linear relationship between immobilised lipase weight and total inhibition. It was found that the functional active site concentration of immobilised CrL varied greatly among different hydrophobic supports, with 56% for C18, compared with 14% for DVB. The described method is a simple and robust approach to measuring functional active site concentration in immobilised lipase samples.",

Several mutants (AcN-Q339K, AcN-Q343K, AcN-T201F, AcN-T201W, AcN-T201L, AcN-T201I) were obtained with dramatically improved thermostability.

The result of homology modeling suggested that the site 201, which was located on the “A” surface (the dimer interaction), played an important role in the oligomerization of nitrilase and the stabilization of substrate binding pocket. The Phe substitution on site 201 was selected in protein engineering of nitrilase LNIT5, which also demonstrated an improvement of thermostability.

The aspartic protease P6281 secreted by the fungus Trichoderma harzianum plays an important role in mycoparasitism on phytopathogenic fungi.

Maximum activity was observed at pH 2.5 and 40 °C, and the enzyme was stable in the pH range of 2.5–6.0. rP6281 significantly inhibited spore germination and growth of plant and animal pathogenic fungi such as Botrytis cinerea, Mucor circinelloides, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Rhizoctonia solani, and Candida albicans. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that rP6281 efficiently damages the cell wall of Botrytis cinerea. In addition, the protease significantly inhibited the development of grey mold that causes rotting of apple, orange, and cucumber, indicating that rP6281 may be developed as an effective anti-mold agent for fruit storage.",

The modified SPE was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The immunosensor was fabricated by sequential immobilization of anti-PSA primary antibody, PSA antigen and HRP-tagged secondary antibody on the surface of AuNPs/CHI/SPE. When this immunosensor was placed in 2.5 mM H2O2, as HRP substrate, and 1 mM methylene blue (MB), as redox mediator, greatly amplified immunosensing signals were observed. Immunosensing signals for the reduction of H2O2 were monitored in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) by CV and square wave voltammetry (SWV). Under optimized conditions steady state current increased linearly with PSA concentration over the range 1–18 ng/ml with a detection limit of 0.001 ng/ml. The fabricated immunosensor demonstrated excellent sensitivity, stability and reproducibility and therefore was successfully applied to analyse PSA in biological samples. Finally, the results indicate that the proposed immunosensor has potential in clinical screening of cancer biomarkers.",

Inonotus baumii, the only known flavone-producing filamentous fungus, is of great importance in the investigation of flavone metabolic pathways. To study the function of PAL enzyme in I. baumii flavone synthesis, a full-length cDNA of pal gene was cloned from I. baumii using DOP-PCR and RACE-PCR. The 2502-bp PAL coding region encodes an 833 amino acid protein with an approximate MW of 88.2 kDa. Three introns and four exons are present in the DNA sequence of IbPAL. Amino acid sequence alignment showed that IbPAL shares 76% similarity with PALs of Inonotus fungi. The three-dimensional structure of IbPAL showed that it is composed of an MIO domain, a core domain and an inserted shielding domain. On this basis, the IbPAL was expressed and purified using the prokaryotic expression vector pSMART-V with a 6xHis-tag in Escherichia coli, and its enzymatic activity was subsequently detected. Our results will aid in understanding the enzymatic properties of PAL and further confirm the mechanism of flavone synthesis in I. baumii.",

     "abstract": "In previous reports, we characterized four endo-xylanases produced by Streptomyces sp. strain SWU10 that degrade xylans to several xylooligosaccharides. To obtain a set of enzymes to achieve complete xylan degradation, a β-d-xylosidase gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein, named rSWU43A, was characterized. SWU43A is composed of 522 amino acids and does not contain a signal peptide, indicating that the enzyme is an intracellular protein. SWU43A was revealed to contain a Glyco_hydro_43 domain and possess the three conserved amino acid residues of the glycoside hydrolase family 43 proteins. The molecular mass of rSWU43A purified by Ni-affinity column chromatography was estimated to be 60 kDa. The optimum reaction conditions of rSWU43A were pH 6.5 and 40 °C. The enzyme was stable up to 40 °C over a wide pH range (3.1–8.9). rSWU43A activity was enhanced by Fe2+ and Mn2+ and inhibited by various metals (Ag+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+), d-xylose, and l-arabinose. rSWU43A showed activity on p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside substrates, with specific activities of 0.09 and 0.06 U/mg, respectively, but not on any xylosidic or arabinosidic polymers. rSWU43A efficiently degraded β-1,3-xylooligosaccharides to produce xylose but showed little activity towards β-1,4-xylobiose, with specific activities of 1.33 and 0.003 U/mg, respectively. These results demonstrate that SWU43A is a β-1,3-d-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.72), which to date has only been described in the marine bacterium Vibrio sp. Therefore, rSWU43A of Streptomyces sp. is the first β-1,3-xylosidase found in gram-positive bacteria.

     "abstract": "Geranyl glucoside, the glucosylated, high-value derivative of the monoterpenoid geraniol, has various applications in the flavor and fragrance industry and can be produced through whole-cell biotransformation of geraniol with Escherichia coli whole-cell biocatalysts expressing the glucosyltransferase VvGT14a. However, the low water solubility and high cytotoxicity of geraniol require the design of a proper biphasic system where the second, non-aqueous phase functions as an in-situ substrate reservoir. In this work, a rational selection strategy was applied for choosing suitable sequestering phases for geranyl glucoside production by whole-cell biotransformation of geraniol. Hansen solubility parameters and octanol/water distribution coefficients were used as first principle methods in combination with extensive database research to preselect 12 liquid and 6 solid sequestering phases. Subsequently, experimental approaches were applied to determine physicochemical characteristics and the distribution of geraniol and geranyl glucoside between the phases. Moreover, the effects of the sequestering phases on the whole-cell biocatalysts and on the produced geranyl glucoside concentration were measured during parallel biotransformations in milliliter-scale stirred-tank bioreactors. The fatty acid ester isopropyl myristate emerged as the best choice due to its low viscosity, very poor water solubility, low price and compatibility with the whole-cell biocatalyst. The biphasic system containing 20 % (v/v) of this solvent boosted geranyl glucoside production (4.2-fold increase of geranyl glucoside concentration in comparison to aqueous system) and exhibits advantageous partitioning of geraniol into the organic phase (logD of 2.42 ± 0.03) and of geranyl glucoside into the water phase (logD of −2.08 ± 0.05). The systematic selection of a suitable biphasic system constitutes basic groundwork for the development of new bioprocesses involving geraniol. Moreover, this study can serve as a guideline for selecting sequestering phases for other whole-cell biotransformation processes.",

In this study, a novel TPL from Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn-TPL) was successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli and screened for l-DOPA synthesis with a specific activity of 2.69 U mg−1.

The enzyme showed broad substrate specificity toward natural and synthetic l-amino acids. Kinetic analysis suggested that the kcat/Km value for l-tyrosine decomposition was much higher than that for l-DOPA decomposition, while Fn-TPL exhibited similar catalytic efficiency for synthesis of l-tyrosine and l-DOPA. With whole cells of recombinant E. coli as biocatalyst, l-DOPA yield reached 110 g L−1 with a pyrocatechol conversion of 95%, which was comparable to the reported highest level.

Due to many advantages of Pichia pastoris expression systems for producing industrial enzymes and pharmaceutical proteins, in this study P. pastoris was chosen as a host for KGF expression. For preparing human KGF coding sequence, MCF-7 cell line was treated with 1,25-Dihydroxy vitamin D3 for inducing the expression of KGF. The coding sequence of 23N-terminal truncated KGF form was amplified using RT-PCR technique and then cloned into the yeast expression vector in frame with the yeast α-factor secretion signal.

To develop effective biodegradation, thermophilic, anaerobic microorganisms were screened from bovine manure compost using fibrillated OPT (f-OPT) pretreated by wet disk milling as the substrate. One thermophilic, anaerobic bacterium, strain CL-2, whose 16S rDNA gene has 98.6% sequence identity with that of Caldicoprobacter faecale DSM 20678T, exhibited high degradation activity (32.7% reduction in total dry solids of f-OPT). Strain CL-2 did not use cellulose as a carbon source, but used hemicelluloses such as xylan, arabinoxylan, starch and pectin at 70 °C. Phylogenetic and morphologic analyses and the polysaccharide use suggest that CL-2 may be classified as a novel species of Caldicoprobacter, named Caldicoprobacter sp. CL-2. To characterize enzymatic activities of CL-2, extracellular enzymes were prepared from culture broth using beechwood xylan as the carbon source. The extracellular enzymes showed high xylanase activity, but low cellulase activity, suggesting that f-OPT degradation may depend on xylanase activity. To understand the xylanase system of CL-2, a major xylanase was cloned and characterized. The xylanase (CalXyn11A) had a modular structure consisting of a glycoside hydrolase (GH) family-11 domain and a family 36 carbohydrate-binding module. CalXyn11A did not show f-OPT degradation activity, but a strong synergistic effect was observed when CalXyn11A was added to the extracellular enzyme preparation. These results indicate that, rather than working alone, CalXyn11A has an important role in enhancing total lignocellulose degradation activity by cooperation with other GHs.",

The cyclic ketone isophorone was stereoselectively hydroxylated (≥95%) by wild-type CYP102A1 to form (R)-4-hydroxyisophorone, an important chiral synthon and flavour and fragrance compound. CYP102A1 variants were also selective for 4-hydroxyisophorone formation and the product formation rate increased over the wild-type enzyme by up to 285-fold, with the best mutants being R47L/Y51F/I401P and A74G/F87V/L188Q. The latter variant, which contained mutations in the distal substrate binding pocket, was marginally less selective. Combining perfluorodecanoic acid decoy molecules with the rate accelerating variant R47L/Y51F/I401P engendered further improvement with the purified enzymes. However when the decoy molecules were used with A74G/F87V/L188Q the amount of product generated by the enzyme was reduced. Addition of decoy molecules to whole-cell turnovers did not improve the productivity of these CYP102A1 systems. WT CYP101A1 formed significant levels of 7-hydroxyisophorone as a minor product alongside 4-hydroxyisophorone. However the F87W/Y96F/L244A/V247L CYP101A1 mutant was ≥98% selective for (R)-4-hydroxyisophorone. A comparison of the two enzyme systems using whole-cell oxidation reactions showed that the best CYP101A1 variant was able to generate more product.

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) revealed minor changes in the particle size distributions of LNPs after laccase catalyzed radicalization, indicating preferably covalent intraparticular cross-linking over polymerization. Changes in the surface morphology of laccase treated LNPs were imaged by atomic force (AFM) and transmission emission (TEM) microscopy. Furthermore, decolorization of LNPs without degradation was obtained using ultrasonication with H2O2 in alkaline reaction conditions. The research results have high impact for the utilization of Kraft lignin as nanosized colloidal particles in advanced bionanomaterial applications in medicine, foods and cosmetics including different sectors from chemical industry.",

     "abstract": "meso­-Diaminopimelate dehydrogenase (meso-DAPDH) catalyzes the reversible oxidative deamination of the d­configuration of meso-2,6­diaminopimelate (meso-DAP) and is thought to have substrate specificity toward meso-DAP. The discovery of the meso-DAPDH from Symbiobacterium thermophilum IAM14863 (StDAPDH) revealed meso-DAPDH members with broad substrate specificity. In order to elucidate the substrate-preference mechanism of StDAPDH, it is necessary to identify the key residues related to this mechanism. Our previous work suggested that the non-active-site R71 of StDAPDH was related to substrate preference. Here, we report the key roles of the non-active site on the catalysis of StDAPDH. In order to explore the mechanism through which non-active-site R71 only affected the amination activity of StDAPDH, we performed molecular dynamic simulations and investigated the functional role of R71 in the type II meso-DAPDH StDAPDH. Site-directed mutagenesis with the allelic site A69 of CgDAPDH as a target proved that when replaced by Arg at position 71 of StDAPDH, the CgA69R mutant showed higher catalytic efficiencies toward a series of 2-keto acids, ranging from 1.2- to 1.5-fold. These findings provide some guidelines for improving our understanding of the broad substrate specificity of StDAPDH.",

In this study, recombinant β-1,3-1,4-glucanase (Bg1314) from Bacillus sp.

We investigated the effects of factors such as the amounts of enzyme and glutaraldehyde, reaction temperature, and pH on catalytic activity. Enzyme activity decreased sharply at high concentrations of glutaraldehyde, likely due to the reaction of glutaraldehyde with lysine residues at the catalytic site of Bg1314, because lysine-substituted Bg1314 retained its activity under the same conditions. Immobilized Bg1314 protein (ImBg1314) was stable over a wide range of pH and could be stored long term at 4 °C. The optimal conditions of ImBg1314 were similar to those of Bg1314. However, the optimal temperature of ImBg1314 differed from that of Bg1314. The products were β-GOS composed of 3-O-β-cellobiosyl-d-glucose and 3-O-β-cellotriosyl-d-glucose.

However, the enzyme was desorbed in 75 mM NaCl at pH 7 and some stability/enzyme concentration dependence still existed.Treatment: of these biocatalysts with glutaraldehyde increased enzyme stability (e.g. at pH 5, after incubation under conditions where the enzyme just ionically exchanged was fully inactivated, the activity of the glutaraldehyde treated enzyme remained unaltered). Immobilization on glutaraldehyde pre-activated supports yielded a higher increase in enzyme activity, but the stabilization was lower. While when measuring the enzyme activity at pH 4 there were no changes after immobilization, all immobilized enzymes were more active than the free enzyme at pH 6 and 7 (2–3 times). The Ki/Km ratio did not significantly decrease in any immobilized biocatalysts, and in some cases it worsened in a significant way (by a 9 fold factor using preactivated supports). The new biocatalysts are significantly more stable and avoid enzyme subunit desorption, being the immobilization pH a key point in their design.",

Based on these backgrounds, sequences in RefSeq database were scored using family profiles of branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT) and d-alanine aminotransferase (DAT) to predict and identify putative R-ωATs. Sequences with two profile analysis scores were plotted on two-dimensional score space. Candidates with relatively similar scores in both BCAT and DAT profiles (i.e., profile analysis score using BCAT profile was similar to profile analysis score using DAT profile) were selected.

In this study, recombinant OF4Ald and its mutants of five conserved residues were constructed, expressed in Escherichia coli, purified by His6-tag affinity column and gel filtration chromatography, structure homology modeling, and characterized.

     "abstract": "The aminopeptidase A (PepA; EC 3.4.11.7) belongs to the group of metallopeptidases with two bound metal ions per subunit (M1M2(PepA)) and is specific for the cleavage of N-terminal glutamic (Glu) and aspartic acid (Asp) and, in low amounts, serine (Ser) residues. Our group recently characterized the first PepA from a Lactobacillus strain. However, the characterization was performed using synthetic para-nitroaniline substrates and not original peptide substrates, as was done in the current study. Prior to the characterization using original peptide substrates, the PepA purified was converted to its inactive apo-form and eight different metal ions were tested to restore its activity. It was found that five of the metal ions were able to reactivate apo-PepA: Co2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+. Interestingly, depending on the metal ion used for reactivation, the activity and the pH and temperature profile differed. Exemplarily, MnMn(PepA), NiNi(PepA) and ZnZn(PepA) had an activity optimum using MES buffer (50 mM, pH 6.0) and 60 °C, whereas the activity optimum changed to Na/K-phosphate-buffer (50 mM, pH 7.0) and 55 °C for CuCu(PepA). However, more important than the changes in optimum pH and temperature, the kinetic properties of PepA were affected by the metal ion used. While all PepA variants could release N-terminal Glu or Asp, only CoCo(PepA), NiNi(PepA) and CuCu(PepA) could release Ser from the particular peptide substrate. In addition, it was found that the enzyme efficiency (Vmax/KM) and catalytic mechanism (positive cooperative binding (Hill coefficent; n), substrate inhibition (KIS)) were influenced by the metal ion. Exemplarily, a high cooperativity (n > 2), KIS value >20 mM and preference for N-terminal Glu were detected for CuCu(PepA). In summary, the results suggested that an exchange of the metal ion can be used for tailoring the properties of PepA for specific hydrolysis requirements.",

     "abstract": "Rhamnolipids are well-known microbial surfactants with many potential applications. Their production cost, however, remains high due to the severe foaming tendency in aerobic fermentation and the relatively low productivity and yield. In this study, we assessed the boundaries set by these constraints after optimization of basic parameters such as dissolved oxygen concentration (DO), pH and carbon sources. DO 10% and pH 5.5-5.7 were found optimal; cell growth and/or rhamnolipid production were slower at lower DO (5%) or pH (5.0) while foaming became hard to control at higher DO (30%) or pH (6.0 and 6.5). Although the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain used was selected for its high rhamnolipid production from glycerol as substrate, soybean oil was still found to be a better substrate that increased specific rhamnolipid productivity to 25.8 mg/g cells-h from the glycerol-supported maximum of 8.9 mg/g cells-h. In addition, the foam volume was approximately halved by using soybean oil instead of glycerol as substrate. Analysis by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry revealed that rhamnolipid compositions from the two carbon sources were also very different, with primarily (82%) monorhamnolipids from soybean oil and more (64%) dirhamnolipids from glycerol. The optimized fermentation produced 42 g/l rhamnolipids at a yield of approximately 47% and a volumetric productivity of 220 mg/l-h. These values are among the highest reported.",

L386W/G417L/G57F (abbreviated as WLF), a good mutant of CotA-laccase from Bacillus pumilus W3, has been constructed and reported by our laboratory with highly improved catalytic efficiency. However, the low-functional expression level of mutant WLF in Escherichia coli was a shortcoming. Three mutants, namely, K317N/WLF, D501G/WLF, and K317N/D501G/WLF, were constructed through site-directed mutagenesis to improve the functional expression of WLF in this study. The soluble and active expression of D501G/WLF and K317N/D501G/WLF in E. coli enhanced 4.48-fold and 3.63-fold level, respectively. The K317N/WLF failed to increase the soluble expression level, but slightly improved the stability of CotA-laccase. Results showed that not only the position 501 is significant for functional expression of B. pumilus W3 CotA, but also these mutants still remained its high thermostability, resistance of alkaline with salt, and conspicuous decolorizing efficiency. This work is the first to improve the soluble expression of B. pumilus CotA-laccase in E. coli by site-directed mutagenesis.

For chemical modification oil-in-water (O/W) and water-in-oil (W/O) microemulsion systems composed of n-butyl acetate and a buffer solution were prepared because n-butyl acetate turned out to be less detrimental to the activity of peroxidase at high degree of modification compared to other organic solvents. The modification degree of amine groups on the surface of peroxidase by maleic anhydride groups on PMA-TD was reached at equilibrium after 1 h reaction at 0 °C, and 42% of amine groups were modified with 7-fold amount of PMA-TD to peroxidase (wt/wt). The activity of the PMA-TD-modified peroxidase measured with 2,4-dichlorophenol at pH 7.0 was increased by approximately 2-fold compared to native peroxidase. There was no significant shift in optimum pH after modification, and optimum pH measured with 2,4-dichlorophenol was observed at pH 7.0. For all six phenolic compounds tested, there was a significant increase in the reaction efficiency with the PMA-TD-modified peroxidase. The remarkable enhancement of the reaction efficiency by the modification was presumably because of micellar structures of PMA-TD that could concentrate hydrophobic phenolic oligomers into the core of the micelles. Overall, horseradish peroxidase chemically attached to the surface of PMA-TD micelles was found to be significantly effective for the oxidative polymerization of phenolic compounds.",

     "abstract": "Monitoring anaerobic digestion (AD) leachate for changes in acetate and propionate concentrations is essential for effective AD operation. In this paper the development of a novel propionate cell-based biosensor is described. A previously designed E. coli mutant (IMD Wldgy) that could selectively determine acetate concentrations in synthetic leachates, based on oxygen uptake measurements, was used as a starting point in the development of a propionate biosensor. However, the propionate-grown IMD Wldgy cells exhibited extremely low propionate:acetate O2 consumption ratios (1:2.4). Screening for alternative propionate-grown E. coli strains naturally possessing a more favourable propionate:acetate O2 consumption ratio identified strain IMD 1, which exhibited a positive ratio (1.6:1). To improve the selectivity of the strain, successive gene knockouts were performed generating the IMD 1 hldgyep mutant. However, propionate-grown IMD 1hdlgyep’s O2 consumption ratio was deemed too low to be considered as a propionate detecting bio-element. It was reasoned that the mechanisms by which E. coli activates acetate had to be removed. Deleting acs (acetyl-CoA synthesase) and ackA (acetate kinase) from IMD Wldgyep, resulted in an E. coli IMD Wldgyepak knockout mutant that, when grown on propionate, produced a mean propionate:acetate O2 consumption ratio of approx. 13:1. The resulting IMD Wldgyep and IMD Wldgyepak strains, which formed the acetate- and propionate-biosensor, respectively, were capable of detecting acetate and propionate concentrations ranging from 0.05 mM to 4.5 mM within two-phase AD synthetic leachates.",

This is particularly true of those enzymes putatively involved in hemicellulose deconstruction. Our research group has been working on mapping and characterization of glycoside hydrolases produced by C. thermocellum B8, that are critical for lignocellulosic biomass deconstruction. One of the identified genes expressed during growth on sugar cane bagasse and straw is axb8, which encodes a putative cellulosomal GH43_29 α-arabinofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.55) that has not previously been characterized at the molecular or kinetic levels. The AxB8 predicted amino acid sequence presented GH43 and dockerin domains, as well as a family 6 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM6). Also, it is a close homologue of Firmicutes putatives α-arabinofuranosidases, including cellulosomal proteins. Multiple alignment analysis grouped AxB8 in a cluster with four uncharacterized putative GH43_29 subfamily enzymes, all containing dockerin type I domain and CBM6 modules. Purified heterologously expressed AxB8 showed activity against the synthetic substrates pNPX (p-nytrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside) and pNPA (p-nytrophenyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside), as well as against the natural substrate wheat arabinoxylan (WAX), with maximal activity at 50 °C and pH between 5.0 and 6.0. The WAX degradation profile by AxB8 is different from those typically seen for α-arabinofuranosidases, presenting mainly xylose as a hydrolysis product, instead of arabinose. In addition, unlike other GH43_29 enzymes already characterized, AxB8 did not present activity against arabinan. Kinetic parameters using pNPA as a substrate were Km of 23 ± 3 mM and kcat of 104 ± 7 s−1. Despite its activity against pNPX, we did not observe AxB8 saturation with this substrate.

Unfortunately, this thioester analog of lactic acid is currently not commercially available. For this reason, we developed an in vitro biosynthesis pathway to convert cysteine to 3-mercaptopyruvate (3MPy), which is then rapidly and efficiently converted to 3ML by suitable lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs). As liver LDH from Rattus norvegicus (LDHRn) was previously described to Exhibit 3MPy reduction activity, in silico studies based on homology to LDHRn were performed and led to the identification of four potentially suitable bacterial LDH candidates from Escherichia coli (LDHEc), Corynebacterium glutamicum (LDHCg), Bacillus cereus (LDHBc) and Gloeobacter violaceus (LDHGv). After heterologous expression in E. coli followed by purification, the enzymes were assessed for their potential to reduce 3MPy to 3ML in comparison to LDHRn. With 3MPy, LDHs from E. coli, C. glutamicum and B. cereus showed no or only very low specific activities of 0.23 ± 0.1 U/mg (LDHCg) and 0.08 ± 0.2 U/mg (LDHBc), respectively. In contrast, LDHGv exhibited a remarkable specific activity of 63.6 ± 8.1 U/mg, being even twice as active as the R. norvegicus LDH. To verify LDH-catalyzed biosynthesis of 3ML we developed and optimized a detection method allowing qualitative analysis and quantification of 3MPy and 3ML by derivatization with Ellman’s reagent and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. This study shows once more the impressive versatility of LDHs and presents a rapid and efficient biosynthesis process for 3ML, a biotechnologically interesting, yet hard-to-obtain, compound.",

Interestingly, LipR displays some similarity with α/β-hydrolases of the C. antartica lipase A (CAL-A)-like superfamily (abH38), bearing a Y-type oxyanion hole, never found before among bacterial lipases. In order to explore this unusual Y-type oxyanion hole, and to improve LipR performance, two modification strategies based on site directed or saturation mutagenesis were addressed. Initially, a small library of mutants was designed to convert LipR Y-type oxyanion hole (YDS) into one closer to those most frequently found in bacteria (GGG(X)). However, activity was completely lost in all mutants obtained, indicating that the Y-type oxyanion hole of LipR is required for activity. A second approach was addressed to modify the two main oxyanion hole residues Tyr110 and Asp111, previously described for CAL-A as the most relevant amino acids involved in stabilization of the enzyme-substrate complex. A saturation mutagenesis library was prepared for each residue (Tyr110 and Asp111), and activity of the resulting variants was assayed on different chain length substrates. No functional LipR variants could be obtained when Tyr110 was replaced by any other amino acids, indicating that this is a crucial residue for catalysis. However, among the Asp111 variants obtained, LipR D111G produced a functional enzyme. Interestingly, this LipR-YGS variant showed less activity than wild type LipR on short- or mid- chain substrates but displayed a 5.6-fold increased activity on long chain length substrates. Analysis of the 3D model and in silico docking studies of this enzyme variant suggest that substitution of Asp by Gly produces a wider entrance tunnel that would allow for a better and tight accommodation of larger substrates, thus justifying the experimental results obtained.",

For further optimization of cofactor regeneration, now a co-expression of CHMO and ADH in E. coli using a Duet™ vector was performed. This led to higher conversion values of the substrate cyclohexanol in whole-cell biocatalysis compared to an expression of both enzymes from two separate plasmids. Furthermore, a more advantageous balance of expression levels between the partial cascade enzymes was achieved via engineering of the ribosome binding site. This contributed to an even faster cofactor regeneration rate.",

Treatment with rMnP or manganese(III) acetate reduced furfural and HMF concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. Furfural disappearance was accompanied by malonate disappearance and accumulation of four distinct degradation products. Furfural was more readily degraded by rMnP and manganese(III) acetate than HMF. Growth assays using Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated that rMnP treatment reduced the toxicity of furfural and HMF.

In order to overcome these drawbacks, five nanoparticles (NPs) (nano-TiO2, nano-MgO, nano-Ni, nano-Cu and nano-Fe3O4) were used to improve CLEAs activity and structure in this study. Results showed that moderate dosage of nano-TiO2 addition increased CLEAs activity, and the most increment was 15.2% relative to CLEAs without NPs. This was possibly due to more channels and smaller size particle of CLEAs after nano-TiO2 addition. Moreover, nano-TiO2 addition not only decreased fluorescence intensity but also caused the red shift in tryptophan (Trp) and tyrosine (Typ) residues. Nano-TiO2 addition decreased Km and increased Vmax of CLEAs. These changes were benefit to the activity and structure of CLEAs. However, addition of other four NPs (nano-MgO, nano-Ni, nano-Cu and nano-Fe3O4) did not increase CLEAs activity and even decrease CLEAs activity due to less amorphous cavities and larger or discrete particle size than CLEAs without NPs. In addition, FT-IR results showed that NPs addition increases the content of regular structure of CLEAs, and causes a partial transformation of β-turn into β-sheet. This study showed that it was potential to improve CLEAs performance by nano-TiO2 addition.",

Its relative stability can be maintained up to 83.76% with relative efficiency up to 84.73%, while CNT/Lac gives the lowest performance levels. This indicates that GA induces an improvement in catalytic activity by (i) increasing the amount of immobilized laccase and (ii) strengthening interaction between laccase and PEI. Therefore, it induces excellent redox reactivity, promoting the ORR, and glucose/O2 biofuel cell performance. The effect of pH on catalytic activity is also measured, with pH 5 being optimal.",

     "abstract": "FAD-dependent Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) have proven to be useful biocatalysts in the selective and specific oxygenation of various ketones. Despite the cloning, heterologous expression and characterization of close to 80 members of this enzyme family, some sub-groups of BVMOs still remain underrepresented and their evolutionary relationship uncertain. Until recently, very few fungal BVMOs have been described. Our previous investigations into BVMOs from the fungus Aspergillus flavus, yielded very little activity on simple cyclic ketones. Here we report on another four BVMOs from A. flavus that are more closely related to cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) from Acinetobacter sp. NCIMB 9871. Evolutionary analysis with other characterized BVMOs show their closest relationship to be with either cycloalkanone monooxygenase (CAMO) or 2-oxo-Δ3-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetyl-coenzyme A monooxygenase (OTEMO). The OTEMO-related BVMOAFL706 and BVMOAFL334 were heterologously expressed in E. coli, purified and shown to be able to convert a range of cyclic and substituted cyclic ketones. Of the unsubstituted cyclic ketones, cyclohexanone showed the highest conversion with maximum turnover frequencies reaching 4.3 s−1 for BVMOAFL706. Unlike CHMOacinet, and many of the closely related BVMOs, no substrate inhibition was observed with cyclohexanone to a concentration of up to 30 mM, creating the possibility for applications requiring high substrate loading. Aliphatic ketones were also readily converted with excellent regioselectivity. Similar to CHMOacinet, acetophenones were not converted and the oxidation of rac-cis-bicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one occurs enantiodivergently, with the (1R,5S) isomer converted to the “normal” lactone and the (1S,5R) isomer to the “abnormal” lactone.",

     "abstract": "The high carbohydrate content of soybean hull makes it an attractive biorefinery resource. But hydrolyzing its complex structure requires concerted enzyme activities, at least cellulase, xylanase, pectinase and α-galactosidase. Effective pretreatment that generates minimal inhibitory products is important to facilitate enzymatic hydrolysis. Combined CO2-H2O pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis by Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma reesei enzyme broths was studied here. The pretreatment was evaluated at 80 °C–180 °C temperature and 750 psi–1800 psi pressure, with fixed moisture content (66.7%) and pretreatment time (30 min). Ground hulls without and with different pretreatments were hydrolyzed by enzyme at 50 °C and pH 4.8 and compared for glucose, xylose, galactose, arabinose, mannose and total reducing sugar release. CO2-H2O pretreatment at 1250 psi and 130 °C was found to be optimal. Compared to the unpretreated hulls hydrolyzed with 2.5-fold more enzyme, this pretreatment improved glucose, xylose, galactose, arabinose and mannose releases by 55%, 35%, 105%, 683% and 52%, respectively. Conversions of 97% for glucose, 98% for xylose, 41% for galactose, 59% for arabinose, 87% for mannose and 89% for total reducing sugar were achieved with Spezyme CP at 18 FPU/g hull. Monomerization of all carbohydrate types was demonstrated. At the optimum pretreatment condition, generation of inhibitors acetic acid, furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was negligible, 1.5 mg/g hull in total. The results confirmed the effective CO2-H2O pretreatment of soybean hulls at much lower pressure and temperature than those reported for biomass of higher lignin contents. The lower pressure requirement reduces the reactor cost and makes this new pretreatment method more practical and economical.",

Through flux balance analysis of an extended genome-scale metabolic network of E. coli, we found that the introduction of non-oxidative glycolysis pathway (NOG), a previously reported pathway enabling complete carbon conservation, can increase the theoretical carbon yield from 67% to 89%, equivalent to the theoretical mass yield from 0.48 g P3HB/g glucose to 0.64 g P3HB/g glucose. Based on this analysis result, we introduced phosphoketolase and enhanced the NOG pathway in E. coli. The mass yield in the engineered strain was increased from 0.16 g P3HB/g glucose to 0.24 g P3HB/g glucose. We further overexpressed pntAB to enhance the NADPH availability and down-regulated TCA cycle to divert more acetyl-CoA toward P3HB. The final construct accumulated 5.7 g/L P3HB and reached a carbon yield of 0.43 (a mass yield of 0.31 g P3HB/g glucose) in shake flask cultures in shake flask cultures.

Highly loaded LU was more stable than low loaded biocatalyst under all studied conditions. Using TLL, the results depended on the inactivation conditions, e.g., crowding was positive at pH 5 and negative at pH 7. Then, all preparations were treated with glutaraldehyde (Glu), polyethyleneimine (PEI) or sequentially with Glu and PEI. These treatments may permit to stabilize the physically immobilized lipases by avoiding enzyme desorption via intermolecular crosslinking. Moreover, immobilizing a second enzyme on the lipase-glutaraldehyde-PEI has been proposed as a strategy without risks of PEI desorption by incubation in high ion strength solutions. The treatments altered the enzyme activity slightly but produced significant enzyme stabilization. This enzyme stabilization was more significant when using the highly loaded preparations, where intermolecular crosslinking was easier to obtain. SDS-PAGE analyses confirmed that crowded enzyme preparations were intermolecular crosslinked using Glu plus PEI, but some molecules still remained non-crosslinked. In general, PEI treatment was the most effective in increasing enzyme stability, while glutaraldehyde had a milder stabilization effect.",

In the case of XynB-CB22, the catalytic and the binding residues seem to be located favorably adjacent to each other, thus showing higher increase in activity.

We employed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) for real time measurement of such catalytic radical formation activity on three types of lignin (two types of organosolv lignin, and a lignin rich residue from wheat straw hydrolysis) brought about by two different fungal laccases, derived from Trametes versicolor (Tv) and Myceliophthora thermophila (Mt), respectively. Laccase addition to suspensions of the individual lignin samples produced immediate time and enzyme dose dependent increases in intensity in the EPR signal with g-values in the range 2.0047–2.0050 allowing a direct quantitative monitoring of the radical formation and thus allowed laccase enzyme kinetics assessment on lignin. The experimental data verified that the laccases acted upon the insoluble lignin substrates in the suspensions. When the action on the lignin substrates of the two laccases were compared on equal enzyme dosage levels (by activity units on syringaldazine) the Mt laccase exerted a significantly faster radical formation than the Tv laccase on all three types of lignin substrates. When comparing the equal laccase dose rates on the three lignin substrates the enzymatic radical formation rate on the wheat straw lignin residue was consistently higher than those of the organosolv lignins. The pH-temperature optimum for the radical formation rate in organosolv lignin was determined by response surface methodology to pH 4.8, 33 °C and pH 5.8, 33 °C for the Tv laccase and the Mt laccase, respectively. The results verify direct radical formation action of fungal laccases on lignin without addition of mediators and the EPR methodology provides a new type of enzyme assay of laccases on lignin.",

However, the relative lack of reusability due to the weakness of the flower-like structure has limited their practical applications. Herein, we have developed a simple but efficient method to synthesize highly robust enzyme-inorganic hybrid nanoflowers, which relies on further crosslinking of the enzyme molecules entrapped in the hybrid nanoflowers by treatment with glutaraldehyde (GA). By employing lipase from Candida rugosa as a model enzyme with copper phosphate during 3 days incubation followed by the additional GA treatment for only 1 h, we could successfully synthesize GA-treated lipase nanoflowers having similar flower-like morphology and hydrolytic activity (ca. 95% compared with the free lipase) as conventionally synthesized lipase nanoflowers without GA treatment. Importantly, the conventional lipase nanoflowers seemed not to be reusable because they lost most of their activity (∼90%) after recycling 4 times, whereas GA-treated lipase nanoflowers exhibited higher retention of their initial activity (over 70%) after 4 reuses, which was also accompanied by an efficient maintenance of their flower-like morphology. Based on our results, we expect that this simple GA-mediated strategy to synthesize enzyme-inorganic hybrid nanoflowers can be readily extended to other enzymes for various biotechnological applications.",

     "abstract": "Chondroitinase ABC I (ChABC I) has been shown to depolymerize a variety of glycosaminoglycan substrates and promote regeneration of damaged spinal cord. However, to date, intrathecal delivery methods have been suboptimal largely due to enzyme instability which necessitates repeated administration to the injured loci. Among the aromatic amino acids, tyrosine has been shown to be more effective in creation of stable clusters and further stabilize of the proteins. Bioinformatics approaches have been used to examine the effect of an extra aromatic cluster at the surface of ChABC I. In this study two amino acids i.e., Asn806 and Gln810 were mutated to tyrosine and to alanine as negative control. In this way, four variants i.e., N806Y/Q810Y, N806A/Q810Y, N806Y/Q810A and N806A/Q810A were created. The results showed that N806Y/Q810Y mutation improved both activity and thermal stability of the enzyme while Ala substitution reduced the enzyme activity and destabilized it. Structural analysis of mutants showed an increase in intrinsic fluorescence intensity and secondary structure content of N806Y/Q810Y mutant when compared to the wild type enzyme indicating a more rigid structure of this variant. Moreover, the N806Y/Q810Y enzyme displayed a remarkable resistance against trypsin degradation with a half-life (t1/2) of 45.0 min versus 32.5 min of wild-type. In conclusion, the data revealed that structural features and activity of ChABC I can be improved by introducing appropriate aromatic clusters at the surface of the enzyme.",

     "abstract": "Even though many enzyme processes occur at the interface of an insoluble substrate, these reactions are generally much less studied than homogenous enzyme reactions in the aqueous bulk. Interfacial (or heterogeneous) enzyme reactions involve several reaction steps, and the established experimental approach to elucidate multi-step reactions is transient (or pre steady-state) kinetics. A key requirement for pre steady-state measurements is good time resolution, and while this has been amply achieved in different commercial instruments, they are generally not applicable to precipitating suspensions of insoluble substrate. Perhaps for this reason, transient kinetics has rarely been reported for heterogeneous enzyme reactions. Here, we describe a quenched-flow system using peristaltic pumps and stirred substrate suspensions with a dead time below 100 ms. The general performance was verified by alkali catalyzed hydrolysis of 2,4-dinitrophenyl acetate (DNPA), and the applicability to heterogeneous reactions was documented by two cellulases (Cel7A and Cel7B) acting on suspensions of microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) at different loads up to 15 g/l. The results showed distinctive differences between the two enzymes. In particular, we found that endo-lytic Cel7B combined very quickly with the substrate and reached the maximal activity within the dead-time of the instrument. Conversely, exo-lytic Cel7A showed a much slower initiation with maximal activity after 5–8 s and a 10-fold lower turnover. We suggest that the instrument may provide an important tool in attempts to elucidate the mechanism of cellulases and other enzymes’ action on insoluble substrate.",

In this study, we present the first report of the immobilization-stabilization of a SuSy by multipoint covalent attachment. This stabilization strategy is very complex for multimeric enzymes because a very intense multipoint attachment can promote a dramatic loss of activity and/or stability. The homotetrameric SuSy from Nitrosomonas europaea (SuSyNe) was immobilized on a glyoxyl agarose support through two different orientations. The first occurred at pH 8.5 through the surface area containing the greatest number of amino termini from several enzyme subunits. The second orientation occurred at pH 10 through the region of the whole enzyme containing the highest number of Lys residues. The multipoint covalent immobilization of SuSy on glyoxyl agarose at pH 10 provided a very significant stabilization factor under reaction conditions (almost 1000-fold more stable than soluble enzyme). Unfortunately, this important enzyme rigidification led to a dramatic loss of catalytic activity. A less stabilized conjugate, which was 65-fold more stable than the soluble form, preserved 64% of its initial catalytic activity. This derivative could be used for 3 reaction cycles and yielded approximately 210 mM of UDP-glc per cycle. This optimal biocatalyst was modified with a polycationic polymer, polyethyleneimine (PEI), increasing its stability in the presence of the organic co-solvents necessary to glycosylate apolar antioxidants by GTs coupled to SuSy.",

In the present work, Met-151 and Thr-153, residues located in the small pocket, were mutated to alanine. The M151A mutant SADH shows significantly lower activity and lower stereoselectivity for reduction of aliphatic ketones than wild-type SADH.

The immobilization and electrocatalytical activity of proline dehydrogenase entrapped in a magnetic mesoporous silica nanomaterial was studied using cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, and square wave voltammetry. The magnetic mesoporous silica networks having a high surface area (362 m2 g−1) exhibited excellent properties for entrapment of proline dehydrogenase. The applied approach led to better resistance to temperature and pH inactivation in comparison to the free enzyme. The electrocatalytic current response of proline dehydrogenase entrapped in a magnetic mesoporous silica nanomaterial toward oxidation of L-proline was maintained in the analytical solution temperature up to 70 °C. The entrapped proline dehydrogenase was casted onto a polycysteine-modified glassy carbon electrode. The electrode was evaluated as an electrochemical biosensor for electrooxidation and determination of L-proline in phosphate buffer solution. A cyclic voltammetry study indicated that the oxidation process of proline is irreversible and is diffusion controlled. The electrochemical behavior was further exploited as a sensitive detection scheme for L-proline determination by differential-pulse voltammetry. Under optimized conditions, the concentration range and detection limit were 0.01–0.15 μM and 0.006 μM, respectively. The method was applied to the assay of L-proline in whole blood and normal and malignant cell line lysates (normal cell (L929); gastric cancer cell-CAT 3, colon cancer cell-HCT, colon cancer cell-SW, and breast cancer cell-MCF7).",

The spectra obtained revealed shifting of bands in the active site of α-amylase indicating a nudging effect of the bonds in this region consequent to high pressure treatment. Also, shifts in bands in the OH stretching vibration of water were observed in the enzyme spectra. These variations in the spectra confirmed changes in the active site as well as in the water associated with the same that perhaps had a concerted effect on the increased activity of α-amylase.",

Lysine decarboxylase (CadA) transforms L-lysine to cadaverine and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) can increases conversion rate and yield as a cofactor. Biotransformation of cadaverine using whole Escherichia coli cells that overexpress the lysine decarboxylase has many merits, such as the rapid conversion of l-lysine to cadaverine, possible application of high concentration reactions up to the molar level, production of less byproduct and potential reuse of the enzyme by immobilization. However, the supply of PLP, which is a cofactor of lysine decarboxylase, is the major bottleneck in this system. Therefore, we initiated our study on PLP precursors and PLP-related enzymes and discovered that pyridoxal (PL) can be a viable alternative to supply PLP. Among various PLP systems examined, pyridoxal kinase (PdxY) showed the highest conversion of PL to PLP, resulting in more than 60% conversion of l-lysine to cadaverine with lysine decarboxylase. When the reaction with 0.4 M l-lysine, 0.2 mM PL and more whole cells was performed, it resulted in an 80% conversion yield. Furthermore, when barium-alginate immobilization was applied, it showed a 90% conversion yield in 1 h with PL, suggesting that it is compatible with developed whole-cell systems without a direct supply of exogenous PLP.",

The current study describes the first GH115 α-glucuronidase, AxyAgu115A, from the alkaliphilic organism Amphilbacillus xylanus. AxyAgu115A was active in a wide pH range, and demonstrated better performance in alkaline condition compared to other characterized GH115 α-glucuronidases, which generally show optimal activity in acidic conditions. Specifically, its relative activity between pH 5.0 and pH 8.5 was above 80%, and was 35% of maximum at pH 10.5; although the enzyme lost 30% and 80% relative residual activity after 24-h pre-incubation at pH 9 and pH 10, respectively. AxyAgu115A was also similarly active towards glucuronoxylan as well as comparatively complex xylans such as spruce arabinoglucurunoxylan. Accommodation of complex xylans was supported by docking analyses that predicted accessibility of AxyAgu115A to branched xylo-oligosaccharides.

The trichothecenes, trichodermin and harzianum A (HA) are produced in species dependent manner respectively, by Trichoderma brevicompactum (TB) and Trichoderma arundinaceum (TA).

Comparative sequence analysis of acetyltransferase enzyme of TB with other chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) family proteins revealed the conserved motif involved in the catalysis. Multiple substrate binding studies were carried out to explore the mechanism behind the two different outcomes. His188 was found to have a role in initial substrate binding. In the case of trichodermin synthesis, represented by ternary complex 1, the trichodermol and acetic anhydride (AAn), the two substrates come very close to each other during molecular simulation analysis so that interactions become possible between them and acetyl group may get transferred from AAn to trichodermol, and Tyr476 residue mediates this phenomenon resulting in the formation of trichodermin.

However, the cost of lignocellulolytic enzymes is a limiting factor in the commercialisation of this technology. This therefore necessitates the optimisation of lignocellulolytic enzyme cocktails through the elucidation of synergistic interactions between enzymes so as to improve lignocellulose hydrolysis and also lower protein loadings in these reactions. However, many factors affect the synergism that occurs between these lignocellulolytic enzymes, such as enzyme ratios, substrate characteristics, substrate loadings, enzyme loadings and time. This review examines the effect of time on the synergistic dynamics between lignocellulolytic enzymes during the hydrolysis of both complex (true) lignocellulosic substrates and model substrates. The effect of sequential and simultaneous application of the lignocellulolytic enzymes on the synergistic dynamics during the hydrolysis of these substrates is also explored in this review. Finally, approaches are further proposed for efficient and synergistic hydrolysis of both complex lignocellulosic substrates and model substrates. With respect to the synergistic enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, this review exposed knowledge gaps that should be covered in future work in order to fully understand how enzyme synergism works: e.g. elucidating protein to protein interactions that exist between these enzymes in establishing synergy; and the effect of lignocellulose degradation products of one enzyme on the behaviour of the other enzyme and ultimately their synergistic relationship.",

Electroporation-mediated overexpression of the genes resulted in two transformants, HSF33-1 and HSF33-2, with 9- and 20-fold increases in hlyB and mdh transcript levels. In addition, up-regulation of proteins at the expected size ranges of 50–60 kDa for HlyB and 40–50 kDa for MDH was observed. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed a protein spot corresponding to HlyB in HSF33-1 with a significant MOWSE score of 164 and 3% sequence coverage, and a spot corresponding to MDH in HSF33-2 gave a significant MOWSE score of 124 with 10% sequence coverage. Physiological evaluation in BG11/HEPES medium and seawater adjusted to 35 g L−1 NaCl confirmed that the transformants could thrive in high salinity with no loss of photosynthetic pigments. Results of the study indicate that overexpression of hlyB and mdh genes confer halotolerance in F. diplosiphon, thus maximizing its potential as a large-scale biofuel agent.",

Inactivation of XOx followed pseudo-first-order kinetics at 0.1–300 MPa and 55.0–70.0 °C. High pressure up to at least 300 MPa stabilized XOx at all the studied temperatures. The highest stabilization effect of HHP on XOx was at 200–300 MPa at 55.0 and 58.6 °C, and at 250–300 MPa at 62.3–70.0 °C. The stability of XOx increased 9.5 times at 300 MPa and 70.0 °C compared to atmospheric pressure at the same temperature. The activation energy of inactivation of XOx decreased with pressure and was 1.9 times less at 300 MPa (97.0 ± 8.2 kJ mol−1) than at 0.1 MPa (181.7 ± 12.1 kJ mol−1). High pressure decreased the dependence of the rate constant of inactivation to temperature effects compared to atmospheric pressure. The stabilizing effect of HHP on XOx was highest at 70.0 °C where the activation volume of inactivation of XOx was 28.9 ± 2.9 cm3 mol−1. A second approach to try to increase XOx stability involved hydrophobic modification using aniline or benzoate. However, the thermal stability of XOx remained unaffected after 8–14 modifications of carboxyl side groups per XOx monomer with aniline, or 12–17 modifications of amino side groups per XOx monomer with benzoate.",

     "abstract": "We previously reported that Fusarium oxysporum 12S produces two bifunctional proteins, FoAP1 and FoAP2, with α-d-galactopyranosidase (GPase) and β-l-arabinopyranosidase (APase) activities. The aim of this paper was to purify a third GPase, FoGP1, from culture supernatant of F. oxysporum 12S, to characterize it, and to determine its mode of action towards gum arabic. A cDNA encoding FoGP1 was cloned and the protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Module sequence analysis revealed the presence of a GH27 domain in FoGP1. The recombinant enzyme (rFoGP1) showed a GPase/APase activity ratio of 330, which was quite different from that of FoAP1 (1.7) and FoAP2 (0.2). Among the natural substrates tested, rFoGP1 showed the highest activity towards gum arabic. In contrast to other well-characterized GPases, rFoGP1 released a small amount of galactose from α-galactosyl oligosaccharides such as raffinose and exhibited no activity toward galactomannans, which are highly substituted with α-galactosyl side chains. This indicated that FoGP1 is an unusual type of GPase. rFoGP1 released 30% of the total galactose from gum arabic, suggesting the existence of a large number of α-galactosyl residues at the non-reducing ends of gum arabic side chains. Together, rFoGP1 and α-l-arabinofuranosidase released four times more arabinose than α-l-arabinofuranosidase acting alone. This suggested that a large number of α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues is capped by α-galactosyl residues. 1H NMR experiments revealed that rFoGP1 hydrolyzed the α-1,3-galactosidic linkage within the side chain structure of [α-d-Galp-(1 → 3)-α-l-Araf-(1 → ] in gum arabic. In conclusion, rFoGP1 is highly active toward α-1,3-galactosyl linkages but negligibly or not active toward α-1,6-galactosyl linkages. The novel FoGP1 might be used to modify the physical properties of gum arabic, which is an industrially important polysaccharide used as an emulsion stabilizer and coating agent.",

     "abstract": "Terminal sialic acids on N-glycan of recombinant human erythropoietin are very important for in vivo half-life, as this glycoprotein has three N-glycosylation sites. N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases I, II, IV, and V (i.e. Mgat1, Mgat2, Mgat4, and Mgat5) catalyze the formation of a glycan antennary structure. These enzymes display different reaction kinetics for a common substrate and generally show low expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Therefore, genetic control of Mgat expression is an effective method to increase sialic acid contents by enhancing glycan antennarity. To produce highly sialylated albumin-erythropoietin (Alb-EPO), we co-overexpressed the Mgat1 and Mgat4 genes in CHO cells and determined the optimal ratio of Mgat1:Mgat4 gene expression. All transfected cell lines showed increased gene expression of Mgat4, including Mgat1 overexpressing cell line. Sialic acid content of Alb-EPO was highest in co-transfected cells with excess Mgat4 gene, and these cells showed a higher tri- and tetra-antennary structure than control cells. Based on these results, we suggest that co-transfection of the Mgat1 and Mgat4 genes at a ratio of 2:8 is optimal for extension of antennary structures. Also, regulation of Mgat gene expression in the glycan biosynthesis pathway can be a novel approach to increase the terminal sialic acids of N-glycans.",

We applied the assembled contigs (N90 of 591 bp) and predicted genes to conduct taxonomic and function annotations, respectively. Results revealed the extraordinary microbial diversity of activated sludge, which included detection of minority populations that are difficult to be explored by traditional molecular methods. Taxonomic analysis indicated that the dominant bacterial phyla were Proteobacteria, Nitrospirae, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. The abundance of the key organisms involved in nitrogen and phosphorous removal were qualified. Aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria distinctly dominate over ammonia-oxidizing archaea and anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria. Various key enzymes involved in the global nitrogen cycle were annotated in the activated sludge. High abundance of the known polyphosphate accumulating organisms was detected (approximately 4.89% of the overall population reads), supporting good phosphorous removal performance.

Dextran is produced by dextransucrase (DSR, EC2.4.5.1), which is produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides. DSR belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family (GH70) and synthesizes branched α-glucan (dextran) with both 5% α(1–3) and 95% α(1–6) glycosidic linkages. The DSR gene dex-YG (Genebank, Accession No. DQ345760) was cloned from the wild strain Leuconostoc mesenteroides 0326. This study generated a series of C-terminally truncated variants of dextransucrase and substituting the amino-acid residues in the active site of DSR. With shorter length of DSR, its polysaccharide-synthesizing capability was impaired heavily, whereas oligosaccharide (acting as prebiotics)-synthesizing capability increased significantly, efficiently producing special sizes of dextran. All truncated mutant enzymes were active. Results demonstrated that the catalytic domain dextransucrase was likely in 800 aa or less. Based on the three-dimensional structure model of dextransucrase built through homology modeling methods, the DSR and its mutants with the acceptor substrate of maltose and donor substrate of sucrose were studied by molecular-docking method. Substituting these amino-acid residues significantly affected enzyme activities. Compared with the wild-type dextran, mutant enzymes catalyzed the synthesis of a-glucan with 1–9% α(1–3) and 90–98% α(1–6) branching linkages. Some mutants introduced a small amount of α(1–4) linkages and α(1–2) linkages. This strategy can be effectively used for the rational protein design of dextransucrase.",

With the assistance of the membrane-blot screening assay, a mutant E47K named G10 that showed improved thermal stability was detected in the first round of error-prone PCR. Using G10 as the parent, two variants G10-11 and G10-20 that showed improved thermal stability and methanol tolerance without loss of activity compared to the wild type RML were obtained. The T5060-value of G10-11 and G10-20 increased by 12 °C and 6.5 °C, respectively.

     "abstract": "The high-yield separation of polymeric parts from wood-derived lignocellulosic material is indispensable in biorefinery concepts. For the separation of cellulose and xylan from hardwood paper pulps to obtain pulps of high cellulose contents, simple alkaline extractions were found to be the most suitable technology, although having certain limitations. These are embodied by residual alkali resistant xylan incorporated in the pulp matrix. Further purification in order to produce pure cellulose with a low uniformity could be achieved selectively degrading residual xylan and depolymerizing the cellulose macromolecules by xylanase and cellulase. The latter help to adjust cellulose chain lengths for certain dissolving pulp grades while reducing the demand for ozone in subsequent TCF bleaching. Experiments applying different commercially available enzyme preparations revealed the dependency of xylanase performance on the residual xylan content in pulps being stimulated by additional cellulase usage. The action of the latter strongly depends on the cellulose allomorphy confirming the impact of the pulp morphology. Hence, the combined application of both types of enzymes offers a high potential for upgrading pulps in order to produce a pure and high-value cellulose product.",

Results from SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and ELISA indicated that HBscFv-IFNγ displayed an excellent immunoreaction against HBsAg. The culture supernatant of X4 was purified by 14F7 affinity chromatography to obtain the fusion protein HBscFv-IFNγ in a purity of 95–98%. The HBscFv–IFNγ was able to bind 27.9% HBsAg in the serum of HBV transgenic mice, showing that the antibody of HBscFv-IFNγ has high binding affinity against HBsAg.

However, a good surfactant should not only have a low equilibrium surface tension, but its dynamic surface tension (DST) should also decrease rapidly with time. In this study, screening of BSs produced by Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum PTCC 1896 (probiotic) was performed based on their DST values measured by Wilhelmy plate tensiometry. The relationship between DST and structural and functional properties (anti-adhesive activity) of the BSs was investigated. The results showed that the changes in the yield, productivity and structure of the BSs were growth medium and incubation time dependent (p < 0.05). Structurally different BSs produced exhibited identical equilibrium surface tension values. However, differences among the structure/yield of the BSs were observed through the measurement of their DST. The considerable dependence of DST on the concentration and composition of the BS proteins was observed (p < 0.05). Moreover, the anti-adhesive activity of the BS was found to be positively correlated with its DST. The results suggest that the DST measurement could serve as an efficient method for the clever screening of BSs producer/production condition, and consequently, for the investigation of probiotic features of bacteria, since the anti-adhesive activity is an important criterion of probiotics.",

To improve the catalytic behavior, especially the operational stability, of the nanocatalyst in consecutive batch reactions, we prepared various iminodiacetic acid-modified magnetic nanoparticles differed in surface polarity and spacer length, on which the His6-tagged pullulanases were chelated via nickel ions, and then studied the correlation between the MNPs surface property and the corresponding catalyst behavior. When pullulanases were chelated onto the surface-modified MNPs, the thermostability of all pullulanase derivatives were lower than that of free counterpart, being not relevant to the protein orientation guided by the locality of the His6-tag, but related to the MNPs basal surface polarity and the grafted spacer length. After chelating of pullulanases onto MNPs, there were changes observed in the pH-activity profile and the apparent Michaelis constant toward pullulan. The changing tendencies were mainly dependent on the His6-tagged pullulanase orientation, and the changing extents were tuned by the spacer length. The reusability of pullulanase immobilized by N-terminal His6-tag was higher than that of pullulanase immobilized by C-terminal His6-tag. Moreover, the reusability of the immobilized pullulanase tested increased till grafting polyether amine-400 as spacer-arm, therefore the N-terminal His6-tagged pullulanase chelating MNPs grafted polyether amine-400 gave the best reusability, which retained 60% of initial activity after 18 consecutive cycles with a total reaction time of 9 h. Additionally, the correlation analysis of the catalyst behaviors indicated that the reusability was independent from other catalytic properties such as thermostability and substrate affinity. All the results revealed that the catalyst behavior can be mainly controlled by the His6-tagged pullulanase orientation than by the MNPs surface property which can tune the catalyst function.",

The purified enzyme was identified as β-amylase with molecular mass of 42 kD. The enzyme displayed Km and kcat values for soluble potato starch of 1.1 mg/mL and 7.8 s−1, respectively.

Specific culture vessels and techniques are needed to cultivate these microorganisms since they are anaerobic and substrates are gaseous. In this work, gas-sampling bag was applied as a gas-cultivation system to study CO/syngas bioconversion by Clostridium autoethanogenum and was demonstrated to be efficient because of its flexibility and excellent ability to maintain the headspace atmosphere. C. autoethanogenum can use CO as the sole carbon and energy source to produce ethanol, acetate as well as CO2. In the experimental range, higher ethanol production was favored by higher yeast extract concentrations, and the maximum ethanol concentration of 3.45 g/L was obtained at 1.0 g/L of yeast extract. Study with various bottled gases showed that C. autoethanogenum preferred to use CO other than CO2 and produced the highest level of ethanol with 100% CO as the substrate. C. autoethanogenum can also utilize biomass-generated syngas (36.2% CO, 23.0% H2, 15.4% CO2, 11.3% N2), but the process proceeded slowly and insufficiently due to the presence of O2 and C2H2. In our study, C. autoethanogenum showed a better performance in the bioconversion of CO to ethanol than Clostridium ljungdahlii, a strain which has been most studied, and for both strains, ethanol production was promoted by supplementing 0.5 g/L of acetate.",

As such, many applications of spermidine as a bio-modulating agent are anticipated. However, sustainable and scalable production of spermidine has not been achieved yet. Therefore, construction of a spermidine production system using Saccharomyces cerevisiae was attempted in this study. In order to secrete spermidine into fermentation broth, TPO1 coding for the polyamine transporter was overexpressed in an engineered S. cerevisiae strain capable of accumulating high concentrations of spermidine. Through optimization of fermentation conditions, the resulting strain (OS123/pTPO1) produced 63.6 mg/l spermidine with a yield of 1.3 mg spermidine/g glucose. However, we observed that spermidine production was repressed in the presence of glucose. To circumvent this problem, the genetic modifications for overproducing spermidine were introduced into an engineered S. cerevisiae capable of fermenting xylose. In a fed-batch fermentation using a mixture of glucose and xylose, the resulting strain (SR8 OS123/pTPO1) produced 224 mg/l spermidine with a yield of 2.2 mg spermidine/g sugars.

To overcome this issue, we discovered that AzoRo accepts an alternative electron donor, 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH), which allows fast turnover at neutral pH. In order to screen this nicotinamide coenzyme mimic as a source of electrons, AzoRo-catalysed reactions were run under neutral conditions, under which typically slow rates are observed with NADH.

The maximal level of La/SSB expression was estimated to be similar for LPS-free E. coli and intact E. coli at different optimal induction periods.

With the goal of enhancing heterologous astaxanthin production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, metabolic engineering and protein engineering were integrated to improve both the expression and activity of rate-limiting enzymes. Firstly, to increase the supply of β-carotene as a key precursor for astaxanthin, a positive mutant of GGPP synthase (CrtE03M) was overexpressed together with three other rate-limiting enzymes tHMG1, CrtI and CrtYB. Subsequently, to accelerate the conversion of β-carotene to astaxanthin, a color screening system was developed and adopted for directed evolution of β-carotene ketolase (OBKT), generating a triple mutant OBKTM (H165R/V264D/F298Y) with 2.4-fold improved activity. After adjusting copy numbers of the above-mentioned rate-limiting enzymes to further balance the metabolic flux, a diploid strain YastD-01 was generated by mating two astaxanthin-producing haploid strains carrying the same carotenogenic pathway. Finally, further overexpression of OCrtZ and OBKTM in YastD-01 resulted in accumulation of 8.10 mg/g DCW (47.18 mg/l) of (3S, 3′S)-astaxanthin in shake-flask cultures.

Cell extract based syntheses are emerging as a novel technique for the production of diverse forms of NPs, and is assured to meet the requirements. Therefore, in order to have a better understanding, and to improvise and gain control over the NPs morphological and surface characteristics, the present investigation systematically evaluates the influence of various major physico-cultural parameters including diverse growth media, concentrations of precursor salts; pH and temperature on the biotransformation of ionic silver (Ag+) to nanopariculate silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), utilizing the cell free extract of the bacterium, P. plecoglossicida. The synthesis, purity, morphology and surface characteristics of the AgNPs during optimization studies were measured. The bactericidal effect of these AgNPs was assessed using multi-drug resistant human pathogens; Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica based on the diameter of inhibition zone in disk diffusion tests. The nanoparticles were found to be of higher toxicity to E. coli and S. enterica than A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. The results demonstrate that the chosen parameters in whole or in part could have a significant influence on the morphology, surface characteristics, duration of production, overall yield and production of AgNPs.",

     "abstract": "Cascade reactions involved unstable intermediates are often encountered in biological systems. In this study, we developed combined cross-linked enzyme aggregates (combi-CLEA) to catalyze a cascade reaction which involves unstable hydrogen peroxide as an intermediate. The combi-CLEA contains two enzymes̶ glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) which are cross-linked together as solid aggregates. The first enzyme GOx catalyzes the oxidation of glucose and produces hydrogen peroxide, which is used by the second enzyme HRP to oxidize 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS). The apparent reaction rate of the cascade reaction reaches 10.5 ± 0.5 μM/min when the enzyme ratio is 150:1 (GOx:HRP). Interestingly, even in the presence of catalase, an enzyme that quickly decomposes hydrogen peroxide, the reaction rate only decreases by 18.7% to 8.3 ± 0.3 μM/min. This result suggests that the intermediate hydrogen peroxide is not decomposed by catalase due to a short diffusion distance between GOx and HRP in the combi-CLEA. Scanning electron microscopy images suggest that combi-CLEA particles are hollow spheres and have an average diameter around 250 nm. Because of their size, combi-CLEA particles can be entrapped inside a nylon membrane for detecting glucose by using the cascade reaction.",

     "abstract": "Enzymes active at low temperature are of great interest for industrial bioprocesses due to their high efficiency at a low energy cost. One of the particularities of naturally evolved cold-active enzymes is their increased enzymatic activity at low temperature, however the low thermostability presented in this type of enzymes is still a major drawback for their application in biocatalysis. Directed evolution of cold-adapted enzymes to a more thermostable version, appears as an attractive strategy to fulfill the stability and activity requirements for the industry. This paper describes the recombinant expression and characterization of a new and highly active cold-adapted xylanase from the GH-family 10 (Xyl-L), and the use of a novel one step combined directed evolution technique that comprises saturation mutagenesis and focused epPCR as a feasible semi-rational strategy to improve the thermostability. The Xyl-L enzyme was cloned from a marine-Antarctic bacterium, Psychrobacter sp. strain 2–17, recombinantly expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and characterized enzymatically. Molecular dynamic simulations using a homology model of the catalytic domain of Xyl-L were performed to detect flexible regions and residues, which are considered to be the possible structural elements that define the thermolability of this enzyme. Mutagenic libraries were designed in order to stabilize the protein introducing mutations in some of the flexible regions and residues identified. Twelve positive mutant clones were found to improve the T5015 value of the enzyme, in some cases without affecting the activity at 25 °C. The best mutant showed a 4.3 °C increase in its T5015. The efficiency of the directed evolution approach can also be expected to work in the protein engineering of stereoselectivity.",

Their performance in bioremediation process and the resistance enhancement against natural microbial biodegradation were studied. The average diameter of enzymatic nanoparticles was 120 nm and showed a high enzyme loading capacity. The kinetic parameters of nanoparticles exhibited a slightly lower catalytic activity (kcat), similar affinity constant (Km) for hydrogen peroxide and higher Km value for the phenolic compound when compared with the free enzyme. The enzymatic nanoparticles showed higher thermostability and the same pH activity profile than those from free enzyme. Ten phenolic compounds, including pesticides, halogenated compounds, endocrine disruptors and antibacterials were transformed by the enzymatic nanoparticles. The transformation rate was lower than those obtained with free enzyme suggesting mass transfer limitations. But very importantly, the enzymatic nanoparticles showed a significant increase of the operational stability in real conditions of wastewater treatment process. Moreover, chemical modification of nanoparticles with different aldehydes still enhanced the operational stability of nanoparticulated enzymes. This enhancement of stability in real conditions and the potential use of biocatalytic nanoparticles in bioremediation processes are discussed.",

Intracellular glutamic acid, the substrate of γ-PGA, is a limiting factor for high yield in γ-PGA production. Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis are both important γ-PGA producing strains, and B. subtilis synthesizes glutamic acid in vivo using the unique GOGAT/GS pathway. However, little is known about the glutamate synthesis pathway in B. licheniformis. The aim of this work was to characterize the glutamate dehydrogenase (RocG) in glutamic acid synthesis from B. licheniformis with both in vivo and in vitro experiments. By re-directing the carbon flux distribution, the rocG gene deletion mutant WX-02ΔrocG produced intracellular glutamic acid with a concentration of 90 ng/log(CFU), which was only 23.7% that of the wild-type WX-02 (380 ng/log(CFU)). Furthermore, the γ-PGA yield of mutant WX-02ΔrocG was 5.37 g/L, a decrease of 45.3% compared to the wild type (9.82 g/L). In vitro enzymatic assays of RocG showed that RocG has higher affinity for 2-oxoglutarate than glutamate, and the glutamate synthesis rate was far above degradation. This is probably the first study to reveal the glutamic acid synthesis pathway and the specific functions of RocG in B. licheniformis. The results indicate that γ-PGA production can be enhanced through improving intracellular glutamic acid synthesis.",

The high resolution crystal structures of apo-form enzyme and that in complex with cellobiose and cellotetraose were solved to 1.36–1.58 Å. The protein folds into two overall regions: one is a six-stranded β-barrel, and the other one consists of several extended loops. Between the two regions lies the substrate-binding channel, which is an open cleft spanning across the protein surface. A continuous substrate-binding cleft from subsite −4 to +3 were clearly identified in the complex structures.

The cost-effectiveness and sustainability of the whole process could be greatly improved by using the cysteine degradation pathway for an intracellular supply of 3MPy. Transamination of cysteine to its corresponding α-keto acid 3MPy is catalyzed by cysteine aminotransferases (CAT). However, CAT activity has so far not been described for bacterial aminotransferases (AT), and it was unknown whether they can be applied for the conversion of cysteine to 3MPy. In this study, we selected eight bacterial aminotransferases based on sequence homology to CAT of Rattus norvegicus (Got1). The aminotransferases included four aspartate aminotransferases (AATs) and four aromatic amino acid aminotransferases (ArATs) from Advenella mimigardefordensis DPN7, Escherichia coli MG1655, Shimwellia blattae ATCC 33430, Ralstonia eutropha H16 and Paracoccus denitrificans PD1222. For a more detailed characterization, all selected AAT or ArAT encoding genes were heterologously expressed in E. coli and purified. CAT activity was detected for all aminotransferases when a novel continuous coupled enzyme assay was applied. Kinetic studies revealed the highest catalytic efficiency of 5.1 mM/s for AAT from A. mimigardefordensis. Formation of 3MPy from cysteine could additionally be verified by an optimized approach using derivatization of 3MPy with the Girard T reagent and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses.",

The CTAB capped gold nanoshells are electrostatically attracted by both the bacterial surface and the enzyme β-galactosidase. The preferential binding of cationic (CTAB)-functionalized gold nanoshells to the more negative bacterial surfaces leaves active β-galactosidase in solution, providing an enzyme-amplified colorimetric response of the binding event. A progressive increase in the enzyme activity is evidenced by the conversion of the yellow-orange CPRG substrate into the red chromophore chlorophenol red, which can be correlated with increasing bacterial cell numbers. Using this strategy, the quantification of bacteria at concentrations as low as 10 bacteria/mL of solution has been achieved. The present method of bacterial cell load assessment offers a distinct potential advantage over other conventional methods such as plate counting in terms of ease of operation, rapidity, high sensitivity and quantitative detection of bacterial cells.",

For a better understanding of the role of N-glycosylation of AmPDH1, a systematic set of N-glycosylation site mutants was investigated in this work, regarding expression efficiency, enzyme activity and stability. Furthermore, the site specific extend of N-glycosylation was compared between native and recombinant wild type AmPDH1.Knocking out the site N252 prevented the attachment of significantly extended N-glycan structures as detected on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but did not significantly alter enzyme performance on modified electrodes. This suggests that not the molecule size but other factors like accessibility of the active site improved performance of deglycosylated AmPDH1/osmium redox polymer modified electrodes. A fourth N-glycosylation site of AmPDH1 could be confirmed by mass spectrometry at N319, which appeared to be conserved in related fungal pyranose dehydrogenases but not in other members of the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase structural family.

The present study deals with the successful screening of potent microorganisms producing l-asparaginase. 47 microorganisms were screened including bacteria, fungi, and yeasts.

Further, the 3-D structure of l-asparaginase from higher producer strains was developed and validated in silico for its activity. l-asparagine (substrate for l-asparaginase) was docked inside the binding pocket of P. lilacinum and S. flexneri. Docking score for the most common substrate l-asparagine is −6.188 (P. lilacinum), −5.576 (S. flexneri) which is quite good. Moreover, the chemical property of the binding pocket revealed that amino acid residues Phe 243, Gln 260, Gly 365, Asp 386 in P. lilacinum and residues Asp 181, Thr 318, Asn 320 in S. flexneri have an important role in H-bonding. The in silico results supports and strengthen the wet lab results. The outcome obtained motivates to take the present study result from lab to industry for the economic/massive production of this enzyme for the diverse therapeutic application.",

     "abstract": "Different lipases have been immobilized on octyl agarose beads at 1 mg/g and at maximum loading, via physical interfacial activation versus the octyl layer on the support. The stability of the preparations was analyzed. Most biocatalysts had the expected result: the apparent stability increased using the highly loaded preparations, due to the diffusional limitations that reduced the initial observed activity. However, lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) was significantly more stable using the lowly loaded preparation than the maximum loaded one. This negative effect of the enzyme crowding on enzyme stability was found in inactivations at pH 5, 7 or 9, but not in inactivations in the presence of organic solvents. The immobilization using ethanol to reduce the immobilization rate had no effect on the stability of the lowly loaded preparation, while the highly loaded enzyme biocatalysts increased their stabilities, becoming very similar to that of the lowly loaded preparation. Results suggested that CALB molecules immobilized on octyl agarose may be closely packed together due to the high immobilization rate and this produced some negative interactions between immobilized enzyme molecules during enzyme thermal inactivation. Slowing-down the immobilization rate may be a solution for this unexpected problem.",

     "abstract": "During Erwinia chrysanthemil-asparaginase (ErA) manufacture, minor conformational variants are formed that elute in the acidic region of the analytical ion-exchange HPLC chromatogram. These variants retain enzymatic activity and form part of the biopharmaceutical product, but must be kept within acceptable limits through controlled operation of the manufacturing process. The high isoelectric point of the ErA native tetramer (8.6) leads to certain process steps being operated in the alkaline pH region. Previously, the formation of these species during processing was not fully understood. In this work, in-process samples were analysed, and alkaline pH (8–9) and hold time were found to be the governing parameters. Formation of ErA acidic species was found to be accelerated at higher pH values and longer hold times, suggesting potential control strategies for the manufacturing process. However, the kinetics of ErA conformational variant formation were found to be slow (0.15–0.25 percent per day at pH 8.5). Changes in the ErA melt temperature (Tm) with pH as determined by both differential scanning calorimetry and differential scanning fluorimetry were found to be predictive of the tendency to form the IEX-HPLC acidic species during processing. Biopharmaceutical process developers should be aware of such changes to proteins and build relevant control strategies into process validation plans.",

From resistant transformants to high zeocin concentrations, maximum GOX expressing transformant was isolated and used throughout the study. Optimal environmental conditions for achieving maximum glucose oxidase (GOX) production was determined by varying temperature (20–30 °C) and final methanol concentration from 0.25–1% (v/v). Maximum GOX production was obtained at 20 °C and 0.25% (v/v) final methanol concentration. Exposure carried out at extremely low frequencies ranging from 1 to 5 Hz and the field strength of 30–100 mT unceasingly. Biomass, GOX, protease productions and cell viability were examined in exposed and non-exposed groups every 12 h up to 96 h.

We recently reported two RG I-degrading enzymes, endo-RG and exo-RG lyases, secreted by Penicillium chrysogenum 31B. Here, our aims were to purify a RG rhamnohydrolase (PcRGRH78A) from the culture filtrate of this strain and to characterize this enzyme. On the basis of the internal amino acid sequences, the encoding gene, Pcrgrh78A, was cloned and overexpressed in Aspergillus oryzae. The deduced amino acid sequence of PcRGRH78A is highly similar to an uncharacterized protein belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 78. Pfam analysis revealed that PcRGRH78A contains a bacterial α-l-rhamnosidase (PF05592) domain. PcRGRH78A shows optimal activity at 45 °C and pH 5. The specificity of PcRGRH78A toward rhamnose (Rha)-containing substrates was compared with that of a P. chrysogenum α-l-rhamnosidase (PcRHA78B) belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 78. PcRGRH78A specifically hydrolyzes RG oligosaccharides that contain Rha at their nonreducing ends, releasing the Rha, but has no activity toward naringin, hesperidin, or rutin. In contrast, PcRHA78B effectively degrades p-nitrophenyl α-l-rhamnopyranoside and the three flavonoids, but not RG oligosaccharides. When galactosyl RG oligosaccharides were used as the substrate, PcRGRH78A released Rha in 3.5-fold greater amounts in the presence of β-galactosidase than in its absence, indicating that PcRGRH78A preferentially acts on Rha residues without the galactose moiety at nonreducing ends. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a gene encoding a RG rhamnohydrolase.",

R02 displayed superb activity on transesterification of acyl glycerols, thus being a good candidate for lipase prospection. Considering the lack of information concerning lipases of the genus Janibacter, we focused on the identification, cloning, expression and characterization of the extracellular lipases of this strain. By means of sequence alignment and clustering of consensus nucleotide sequences, a DNA fragment of 1272 bp was amplified, cloned and expressed in E. coli. The resulting recombinant enzyme, named LipJ2, showed preference for short to medium chain-length substrates, and displayed maximum activity at 80 °C and pH 8–9, being strongly activated by a mixture of Na+ and K+. The enzyme presented an outstanding stability regarding both pH and temperature. Bioinformatics analysis of the amino acid sequence of LipJ2 revealed the presence of a consensus catalytic triad and a canonical pentapeptide. However, two additional rare motifs were found in LipJ2: an SXXL β-lactamase motif and two putative Y-type oxyanion holes (YAP). Although some of the previous features could allow assigning LipJ2 to the bacterial lipase families VIII or X, the phylogenetic analysis showed that LipJ2 clusters apart from other members of known lipase families, indicating that the newly isolated Janibacter esterase LipJ2 would be the first characterized member of a new family of bacterial lipases.",

The estimate of total cell number after incubation for 72 h, the ratio of adherent to suspended cells, counting of neurite outgrowths on parylene-N or parylene-C films after UV exposure suggested that these films were suitable for proliferation as well as differentiation of PC-12 cells. The differences in surface properties of parylene-N and parylene-C films with and without UV exposure were analyzed by contact angle measurement, Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. According to these analyses, introduction of oxygen-related chemical functional groups was presumed to result in increased hydrophilicity and efficiency of protein immobilization on parylene-N and parylene-C films after UV treatment.

Second, EG yield was further improved by expressing the YjgB, which was identified as the most suitable aldehyde reductase endogenous to E. coli. Finally, cellular growth, d-xylose consumption, and EG yield were further increased by blocking a competing reaction.

The pre-hydrolyzed liquor containing a high amount of metabolites such as polyphenols, hemicelluloses and its derivatives are mainly assisted for the reduction and stabilization process of Ag+ ions to AgNPs. The formation of AgNPs is monitored by recording the UV–vis spectrophotometer for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak observed at ∼415 nm. The intensity of SPR increased linearly with increasing the reaction time at ambient condition. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of AgNPs reveals the formation of face-centered cubic structure. Field emission electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show the spherical shaped particles and narrow size distribution with an average diameter of 25–30 nm. The elemental analysis by energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX) analysis confirms the presence of Ag as the major amount and is found to be 82%. Analysis of the fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the NPs revealed the presence of phytoconstituents from pre-hydrolyzed liquor adsorbed on the surface of AgNPs. Moreover, in vitro, antimicrobial activity is found to be effective for as-synthesized AgNPs on tested bacteria (viz., P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and E. coli) followed by fungus (C. oxysporum, P. chrysogenum, C. albicans and A.niger).

These results suggest that the family-3 carbohydrate binding module (CBM3) of RjCipA in the RjCel5B-RjCipA complex plays an important role for hydrolysis of cellulose and the substrate-targeting effect of the CBM is more significant than the proximity effect caused by the presence of plural catalytic subunits adjoining each other. In contrast, the 6:1 complex of RjXyn10C and RjCipA showed 45% and 28% of the activities of RjXyn10C toward insoluble wheat arabinoxylan and rice straw powder, respectively. These results suggest that both a negative proximity effect and substrate-isolating effect, but not substrate-targeting effect, are caused by the CBM3 with inappropriate polysaccharide specificity. Substrate-targeting, proximity and substrate-isolating effects are discussed.",

     "abstract": "The cellulase-mediated degradation of cellulosic materials, which is initiated by endoglucanases by the random cleavage of the glycosidic bonds between glucose units to break long cellulose molecules into shorter ones, represents a major carbon flow in the global carbon cycle. The structure of a typical endoglucanase contains a classical (α/β)8 barrel fold catalytic domain, a linker region and a cellulose-binding domain. In this study, we found that both the full-length enzyme and the catalytic domain of endoglucanase EGL1 cloned from Penicillium crustosum strain 601 have CMCase and FPase activity. A cellulose-binding assay using green fluorescent protein as a marker further showed that the catalytic domain could also bind the cellulose substrate. The three-dimensional structure of the catalytic domain of EGL1 revealed that this cellulose substrate-binding capacity of the catalytic domain may come from the hydrophobic core formed by aromatic amino acids distributed in or outside the (α/β)8 barrel fold. A glycine scanning mutagenesis assay further found that the aromatic amino acids at the bottom of the barrel fold and those adjacent to the catalytic site significantly affect the cellulolytic activity and the cellulose binding affinity of the catalytic domain. Thus, it could be speculated that the aromatic amino acids in the bottom of the barrel fold might be the main contributors in the binding capacity of the catalytic domain with the cellulose substrate, and those distributed around the active sites on the top of the enzyme might participate in moving the cellulose substrate to the active site in the barrel fold or releasing the hydrolysis products.",

The mutant enzymes were expressed in Pichia pastoris SMD1168, and their thermal stability, pH stability, trypsin resistance and pepsin resistance were determined. Two mutant MAN47 enzymes, g-123 and g-347, were glycosylated as expected when expressed in yeast, and their thermal stability, pH stability, and protease resistance were significantly improved compared to the wild-type enzyme.

Magnetite nanoparticles were coated with chitosan (CHIT) and modified with glutaraldehyde (GLUT) and aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS). Later, CALB was adsorbed on the modified support.The proposed novel protein quantification method included the determination of sulfur (from protein in CALB solution) by means of Atomic Emission by Inductive Coupling Plasma (AE-ICP). Four different protocols were applied combining AE-ICP and classical Bradford assays, besides Carbon, Hydrogen and Nitrogen (CHN) analysis. The calculated error in protein content using the “classic” Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as standard ranged from 400 to 1200% when protein in CALB solution was quantified. These errors were calculated considering as “true protein content values” the results of the amount of immobilized protein obtained with the improved method. The optimum quantification procedure involved the combination of Bradford method, ICP and CHN analysis.",

Post-translational modification and N-terminal sequencing analysis demonstrated that the expression product was comprised of two polypeptides with different N-terminal sequences, presumably due to the presence of lysine-arginine (KR) sequence in the putative mature region. Substrate specificity analysis showed that PaBG1b hydrolyzed a broad range of substrates including cellohexaose, with the preference for aryl β-d-fucosyl linkage and laminaribiose. Although the glucose tolerance of PaBG1b was moderate (Ki = 200.3 ± 1.1 mM), PaBG1b demonstrated high specific activity and catalytic efficiency towards cellobiose with Vmax and kcat/Km values of 436.7 ± 6.3 U/mg and 109.8 mM−1 s−1, respectively.

Incubation of C. vulgaris conditioned medium with AgNO3 resulted in a medium color change to yellow/brown (with UV–vis absorbance at 415 nm), indicative of silver nanoparticle formation. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of purified nanoparticles confirmed the presence of both silver and chlorine atoms, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed the typical pattern of cubic crystalline AgCl-NPs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that most particles (65%) were spherical, with average diameter of 9.8 ± 5.7 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of purified nanoparticle fractions suggested that proteins are the main molecular entities involved in AgCl-NP formation and stabilization. AgCl-NPs (from 10 μg/mL) decreased by 98% the growth of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae bacterial pathogens, and had a dose-dependent effect on cell viability, which was measured by automated image-based high content screening (HCS).

     "abstract": "Engineering of invertases has come to attention because of increasing demand for possible applications of invertases in various industrial processes. Due to the known physicochemical properties, invertases from micro-organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae carrying SUC2 gene are considered as primary models. To improve thermostability and catalytic efficiency of SUC2 invertase (SInv), six influential residues with Relative Solvent Accessibility < 5% were selected through multiple-sequence alignments, molecular modelling, structural and computational analyses. Consequently, SInv and 5 mutants including three mutants with single point substitution [Mut1 = P152 V, Mut2 = S85 V and Mut3 = K153F)], one mutant with two points [Mut4 = S305V-N463 V] and one mutant with three points [Mut5 = S85V-K153F-T271 V] were developed via site-directed mutagenesis and produced using Pichia pastoris as the host. Physicochemical studies on these enzymes indicated that the selected amino acids which were located in the active site region mainly influenced catalytic efficiency. The best improvement belonged to Mut1 (54% increase in Kcat/Km) and Mut3 exhibited the worst effect (90% increase in Km). These results suggest that Pro152 and Lys153 play key role in preparation of the right substrate lodging in the active site of SInv. The best thermostability improvement (16%) was observed for Mut4 in which two hydrophilic residues located on the loops, far from the active site, were replaced by Valines. These results suggest that tactful simultaneous substitution of influential hydrophilic residues in both active site region and peripheral loops with hydrophobic amino acids could result in more thermostable invertases with enhanced catalytic efficiency.",

     "abstract": "Maltogenic amylases (MAases, EC 3.2.1.133) have been gotten much attention due to their various applications in industry and commercial processes. MAases belong to subfamily 20 of glycoside hydrolase family 13 (NPase or CDases subfamily) and they have important differences with other members of the family. This enzyme consists of two subunits which form two active sites in the dimer form by binding of the central domain of each subunit to the N domain of the next one (domain-swapping dimeric structure). Allosterism is a possible way of regulating enzymatic activity and no evidence has been found regarding to the cooperativity and correlation between MAases subunits, therefore in this study the allosteric behavior of MAases from a native strain (Geobacillus sp. Gh6) was investigated. Unlike other members of α-amylase family, MAases showed positive cooperativity between their subunits and the enzyme exhibited sigmoidal nature towards all three cyclodextrin (CD) substrates with a Hill constant (nH) value equal to 2, 1.6 and 1.1 for α-CD, β-CD and γ-CD, respectively. On further analysis, the effect of glucose and maltose as MAases allosteric effectors in the presence of β-CD substrate showed that these two effectors had a biphasic effect; while they stimulated the enzyme activity at low concentrations (with a decrease in Hill constant), these metabolites acted as allosteric inhibitors at higher concentrations. Due to the key role of MAases in carbohydrate metabolization, an efficient regulating system for this enzyme is required. In this experiment, for the first time the allosteric properties of MAases were observed and investigated.",

Using the red-emitter mutant luciferase (E354R/Arg356), the single (-Q35R, -I182R, -I232R and -L300R), double (-Q35R/I232R) and triple (-Q35R/I232R/I182R) mutant luciferases were introduced. The relative remaining activity of -I232R, double and triple mutants increased significantly compared to the wild-type at 40 °C. The optimal temperature of these mutants increased up to 40 °C which were 15 °C more than wild-type luciferase. It is anticipated that these mutations increased the local interactions that finally improved the thermostability and optimum temperature of luciferase. It should be noted that Arg substitution at amino acid positions 35, 182 and 232 had no effect on the bioluminescence emission spectra. Furthermore, these mutations have not significantly changed the specific activities of firefly luciferases. Finally, with the use of the homology modeling and molecular docking, the effects of these substitutions were evaluated. In conclusion, this study provides beneficial insights on how the thermal stability of luciferase can be improved by protein engineering for biological applications.",

Hall effect measurements showed that the sheet carrier concentration was −1.44 × 1015 cm−2 for AZO and −6 × 1014 cm−2 for ZnO. The films were then modified by drop-casting glucose oxidase (GOx) without the use of any mediators.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggested that the protein was bound by dipole interactions between AZO lattice oxygen and the amino group of the enzyme. Chronoamperometry showed sensitivity of 5.5 μA mM−1 cm−2 towards glucose for GOx/AZO and 2.2 μA mM−1 cm−2 for GOx/ZnO. The limit of detection (LoD) was 167 μM of glucose for GOx/AZO, as compared to 360 μM for GOx/ZnO. The linearity was 0.28–28 mM for GOx/AZO whereas it was 0.6–28 mM for GOx/ZnO with a response time of 10s. Possibly due to higher enzyme loading, the decrease of impedance in presence of glucose was larger for GOx/ZnO as compared to GOx/AZO in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

Similar Km values were obtained for rXyn10E and X-CBM3, but kcat and kcat/Km values for X-CBM3 and X-GH10 were lower than those for rXyn10E, suggesting that CBM22 of Xyn10E may contribute to catalytic efficiency. In binding assays, X-CBM3 was still able to bind to β-glucan, soluble xylan, insoluble xylan, and cellulose through GH10 and CBM3. These results indicate that CBM22 has an important role not only in binding to xylan and β-glucan but also in feeding both polysaccharides into the neighboring GH10 catalytic domain. rXyn10E showed remarkable synergism with rXyn11A, a major xylanase subunit of P. curdlanolyticus B-6, in the degradation of untreated corn stover and sugarcane bagasse; however, the combination of X-CBM3 and rXyn11A was not synergistic.

Through the systematical investigation of the biosynthetic conditions, including culture medium replacement, input time point of cadmium source, working concentrations of raw inorganic ions, and co-cultured time spans of bacteria and metal ions in the bio-manufacture, the results revealed that CdS quantum dots with the strongest fluorescence emission were successfully prepared when E. coli cells were in stationary phase, with the replacement of culture medium and following the incubation with 1.0 × 10−3 mol/L cadmium source for 2 days. Results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that the sensitivities to eight types of antibiotics of E. coli were barely changed before and after CdS quantum dots were prepared in the mild temperature environment, though a slight fall of antibiotic resistance could be observed, suggesting hinted the proposed technique of producing quantum dots is a promising environmentally low-risk protocol.",

In this study, the recombinant R. sphaeroides with highly-expressed CA was developed based on a surface displayed system of CA (pJY-OmpCA) on the outer membrane of R. sphaeroides using outer membrane protein (Omp) in R. sphaeroides, Finally, two more different recombinant R. sphaeroides were developed, which transformed with a two-vector system harboring cytosolic expressed CA (pJY-OmpCA-CA)or PEPC (pJY-OMPCA-PEPC) in R. sphaeroides with surface displayed CA on the outer membrane. In case of recombinant R. sphaeroides with the pJY-OmpCA-PEPC, it has shown the highest CO2 reduction efficiency and the production of several organic compounds (carotenoids, polyhydroxybutyrate, malic acid, succinic acid). It means that the surface displayed CA on the R. sphaeroides would accelerate the CO2-bicabonate conversion on the bacterial outer membrane. Moreover, inducible over-expression of PEPC with surface-displayed CA was successfully used to facilitate a rapider CO2 reduction and quicker production of organic compounds.",

The colorimetric method was used to investigate the activity of ten laccases and eight peroxidases on three technical lignins under different experimental conditions (e.g., by altering pH and mediator used). The colorimetric method was also coupled to a size-exclusion chromatographic separation of the lignin sample obtained after the enzymatic treatment in order to verify whether the enzymatic treatment resulted in lignin depolymerization, too.

In the present work, the methanol resistance of Yarrowia lipolytica Lipase 2 (YLLIP2) was significantly improved using β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) as an additive. According to the results, YLLIP2 with β-CD exhibited approximately 7000 U/mg specific activity in 30 wt% methanol for 60 min compared with no activity without β-CD under the same conditions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results indicated that the β-CD molecules weakened the conformational change of YLLIP2 and maintained a semi-open state of the lid by overcoming the interference caused by methanol molecules. Furthermore, the β-CD molecule could directly stabilize “pathway” regions (e.g., Asp61-Asp67) and indirectly stabilize “pathway” regions (e.g., Gly44-Phe50) by forming hydrogen bonds with “pathway” regions and nearby “pathway” regions, respectively. The regions stabilized by the β-CD molecule then prevented the closure of active pockets, thus retaining the enzymatic activity of YLLIP2 with β-CD in methanol solvent.",

Glycoside hydrolase family 8 enzymes include many important biotechnological biocatalysts yet little is known of the performance of these with respect to pH. A better understanding of this parameter and its relationship to structure and function in these enzymes will allow for an improved use of these in industry as well as an enhanced ability in their engineering and optimisation for a particular application. An in-depth analysis of the pH induced changes in activity, irreversible inactivation, conformation, stability and solubility of a commercial glycoside hydrolase family 8 xylanase was carried out with the aim of identifying the factors determining the pH dependence of this enzyme. Our study showed that different phenomena play different roles at the various pHs examined. Both reversible and irreversible processes are involved at acidic pHs, with the irreversible processes dominating and being due to protein aggregation and precipitation. At basic pHs, loss of activity is principally due to reversible processes, possibly deprotonation of an essential catalytic residue, but at higher pHs, near the pI of the protein, precipitation again dominates while structure unfolding was discerned at the higher pHs investigated. Such insights demonstrate the complexity of factors involved in the pH dependence of proteins and advances our knowledge on design principles and concepts for engineering proteins. Our results highlight the major role of protein precipitation in activity and stability losses at both low and high pHs but it is proposed that different strategies be used in tailoring the enzyme to overcome this in each case. Indeed the detailed understanding obtained here will allow for a more focused, informed and hence successful tailoring of glycoside hydrolase family 8 proteins for a specific pH and process application.",

     "abstract": "Biocathodes may be a suitable replacement of platinum in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) if the cost of MFCs is to be reduced. However, the use of enzymes as bio-cathodes is fraught with loss of activity as time progresses. A possible cause of this loss in activity might be pH increase in the cathode as pH gradients in MFCs are well known. This pH increase is however, accompanied by simultaneous increase in salinity; therefore salinity may be a confounding variable. This study investigated various ways of mitigating pH changes in the cathode of MFCs and their effect on laccase activity and decolourisation of a model azo dye Acid orange 7 in the anode chamber. Experiments were run with catholyte pH automatically controlled via feedback control or by using acetate buffers (pH 4.5) of various strength (100 mM and 200 mM), with CMI7000 as the cation exchange membrane. A comparison was also made between use of CMI7000 and Nafion 117 as the transport properties of cations for both membranes (hence their potential effects on pH changes in the cathode) are different. Results show that using Nafion 117 membrane limits salinity and pH changes in the cathode (100 mM acetate buffer as catholyte) leading to prolonged laccase activity and faster AO7 decolourisation compared to using CMI7000 as a membrane; similarly automatic pH control in the cathode chamber was found to be better than using 200 mM acetate buffer. It is suggested that while pH control in the cathode chamber is important, it does not guarantee sustained laccase activity; as salinity increases affect the activity and it could be mitigated using a cation selective membrane.",

NP synthesis in biofilms offers additional advantages, such as higher biomass concentrations and larger surface areas, which can lead to more efficient and scalable biosynthesis. Although biofilms have been used to produce NPs, the mechanistic details of NP formation are not well understood. In this review, we identify three critical areas of research and development needed to advance our understanding of NP production by biofilms: 1) synthesis, 2) mechanism and 3) stabilization. Advancement in these areas could result in the biosynthesis of NPs that are suitable for practical applications, especially in drug delivery and biocatalysis.

In this scenario, the employ of botanical and invertebrate extracts as reducing, stabilizing and capping agents for the synthesis of nanoparticles is advantageous over chemical and physical methods, since it is one-pot, cheap, and does not require high pressure, energy, temperature, or the use of highly toxic chemicals. Considering the overlooked connection between mosquito vector activity and the spread of cancer in USA, this review focused on the current knowledge available about green synthesized nanoparticles with efficacy against mosquito-borne diseases and cancer. Green fabricated metal nanoparticles showed antiplasmodial activity that often encompasses the efficacy of currently marked drugs for malaria treatment.

     "abstract": "Despite their large secretome and wide applications in bioprocesses, fungi remain underexplored in metal nanoparticles (MNP) biosynthesis. Previous studies have shown that cell surface proteins of Rhizopus oryzae play a crucial role in biomineralization of Au(III) to produce gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Therefore, it is hypothesized that purified cell surface protein may produce in vitro AuNPs with narrow size distribution for biomedical and biocatalytic applications. However, different protein extraction methods might affect protein stability and the AuNP biosynthesis process. Herein, we have explored the extraction of cell surface proteins from R. oryzae using common detergents and reducing agent (sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) Triton X-100, and 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT)) and their effect on the size and shape of the biosynthetic AuNPs. The surface proteins extracted with reducing agent (DTT) and non-ionic detergent (Triton X-100) produce spherical AuNPs with a mean particle size of 16 ± 7 nm, and 19 ± 4 nm, respectively, while the AuNPs produced by the surface protein extracted by ionic detergent (SDS) are flower-like AuNPs with broader size distribution of 43 ± 19 nm. This synthetic approach does not require use of any harsh chemicals, multistep preparation and separation process, favouring environmental sustainability. The biosynthetic AuNPs thus formed, are stable in different physiological buffers and hemocompatible, making them suitable for biomedical applications.",

     "abstract": "A straightforward synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNps) is achieved by novel probiotic Lactobacillus kimchicus DCY51T isolated from Korean kimchi via an intracellular membrane-bound mechanism. The bioreduction of HAuCl4 into AuNps was verified by ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry at ∼540 nm. AuNps were spherical with varying sizes of 5–30 nm. AuNps maintained an average crystallite size of 13 nm and demonstrated long-term stability in physiological buffer and biological media. Furthermore, the protective capping layer consisted of amino acid residues and surface-bound proteins rendered them non-toxic to murine macrophage (RAW264.7) and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT29) cell lines. Finally, biosynthesized AuNps served as superior free radical scavengers against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in contrast to their corresponding gold salt. In short, this green synthesis is cost-effective and advantageous for the development of a new class of probiotics mediated and non-toxic carriers in targeted drug delivery systems, cancer diagnostic, photothermal therapy, biosensing, and medical imaging.",

     "abstract": "Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a minimally invasive and effective cancer treatment method and has a great potential for innovating the conventional chemotherapy approaches. Copper sulfide (CuS) exhibits photostability, low cost, and high absorption in near infrared region, and is recognized as an ideal candidate for PTT. However, CuS, as a photothermal agent, is usually synthesized with traditional chemical approaches, which require high temperature, additional stabilization and hydrophilic modification. Herein, we report, for the first time, the preparation of CuS nanoparticles as a photothermal agent by a dissimilatory metal reducing bacterium Shewanella. oneidensis MR-1. The prepared nanoparticles are homogenously shaped, hydrophilic, small-sized (∼5 nm) and highly stable. Furthermore, the biosynthesized CuS nanoparticles display a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 27.2% because of their strong absorption at 1100 nm. The CuS nanoparticles could be effectively used as a PTT agent under the irradiation of 1064 nm. This work provides a simple, eco-friendly and cost-effective approach for fabricating PTT agents.",

The pasteurized biogenic FeS enabled 5 times faster dechlorination than abiotic FeS that had larger sizes and irregular structure, confirming a significant contribution of the biogenic FeS to CT bioreduction resulting from its good dispersion and relatively high dechlorination activity.

They belong to eight families within the Carbohydrate Esterase (CE) class of the CAZy database. AcXE classification is largely based on sequence-dependent phylogenetic relationships, supported in some instances with substrate specificity data. However, some sequence-based predictions of AcXE-encoding gene identity have proved to be functionally incorrect. Such ambiguities can lead to mis-assignment of genes and enzymes during sequence data-mining, reinforcing the necessity for the experimental confirmation of the functional properties of putative AcXE-encoding gene products.Although one-third of all characterized CEs within CAZy families 1⿿7 and 16 are AcXEs, there is a need to expand the sequence database in order to strengthen the link between AcXE gene sequence and specificity. Currently, most AcXEs are derived from a limited range of (mostly microbial) sources and have been identified via culture-based bioprospecting methods, restricting current knowledge of AcXEs to data from relatively few microbial species. More recently, the successful identification of AcXEs via genome and metagenome mining has emphasised the huge potential of culture-independent bioprospecting strategies. We note, however, that the functional metagenomics approach is still hampered by screening bottlenecks.The most relevant recent reviews of AcXEs have focused primarily on the biochemical and functional properties of these enzymes. In this review, we focus on AcXE phylogeny, classification and the future of metagenomic bioprospecting for novel AcXEs.",

Glutaraldehyde cross-linking significantly decreased protein release from nanofibers and BSA loading reached as high as 27.3% (w/w). In comparison with the HRP immobilized into the nascent nanofibrous membrane, a significant increase was observed in the activity retention of the enzyme immobilized into the PVA/BSA biocomposite nanofibers.

Although the amino acid sequence of the bjmpd-encoded enzyme, named BjMPH, differed from that of MPH from Pseudomonas sp. WBC-3 (PsMPH) in only three residues, Ser132, Val247 and Ala267, a significantly higher specific activity towards MP was exhibited by BjMPH than PsMPH. Among them, Ala267 was identified as a key site affecting the catalytic efficiency, and it was rather conservative (Ala or Ser) in homologous proteins, suggesting that a simple substitution of the residue in conservative site with another conservative residue based on the consensus sequence approach might possibly enhance the catalytic efficiency of the MP-degrading enzyme. Inspired by such an observation, we identified a new mutant, BjMPHT64N, exhibiting 3.78-fold higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) towards MP than its wild-type, reaching 4.20 × 106 M−1 s−1. The mutant BjMPHT64N also displayed enhanced reactivities (kcat/KM) towards other organophosphorus pesticides. Homology-modelling analysis indicates that enhanced polar contacts of the 64th residue in this mutant may contribute to stabilizing the structure of the enzyme and promote the interactions between enzyme and substrate. This study generated an efficient MP-degrading enzyme, and provides useful information for enhancing the catalytic efficiency of MPHs via conservative residue substitution based on the consensus approach.",

The lipase of Serratia marcescens belonging to family I.3 lipase has a very important pharmaceutical application in production of chiral precursors. In the present study, to achieve improved lipase activity and thermostability, using computational predictions of protein, four mutant lipases of SML (MutG2P, MutG59P, Mut H279K and MutL613WA614P) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The recombinant mutant proteins were over-expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography on the Ni-NTA system. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and kinetic parameters (Km and kcat) were determined. Our results have shown that the secondary structure of all lipases was approximately similar to one another.

ATH was confirmed to be located in both cell surface and vacuoles and the overexpression of ATH was observed to decrease vacuolar activity. Therefore, an assumption was suggested to explain this phenomenon as follows: when grown on containing trehalose medium, the ATH localization at cellular periplasm, but not the vacuole, is prioritized to utilize the extracellular trehalose for cell growth. The multivesicular body pathway (MVB pathway) via which ATH is transported into vacuoles is believed to be down-regulated to favor the accumulation of ATH at cell surface area. By extension, other vacuolar proteins travelling through MVB pathway to reach yeast vacuoles likely also suffer the down regulation. It can be concluded that acid trehalase may contribute down regulation of other vacuolar proteins through MVB pathway. This study suggests that it is a potential of acid trehalase (ATH) on impaired activity of yeast vacuolar.",

In addition, ADH2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae can effectively catalyze 3,4-dihydroxybutanal to BT. Also, YjhG was identified as the major xylonate dehydratase and was co-overexpressed with YqhD, resulting in an improvement of BT production by 30%. Moreover, we identified and eliminated the competing branch pathway by inactivating 2-keto acid reductases (yiaE). Finally, the combination of these approaches led to BT production of 5.1 g/L.

To elucidate the exact mechanisms by which β-etherase LigF interact with lignin, molecular modeling was applied.

Fermentation experiments with the engineered strains showed that (i) deletion of ddh improved l-threonine production by 17%, and additional deletion of lysE further improved l-threonine production by 28%; (ii) deletion of ddh improved l-isoleucine production by 8% and improved cell growth by 21%, whereas additional deletion of lysE had no further influence on both l-isoleucine production and cell growth; (iii) l-lysine by-production was reduced by 95% and 86% in l-threonine and l-isoleucine production, respectively, by deletion of ddh and lysE.

Developing new methods to efficiently purify pharmaceutical proteins like uricase has attracted researchers’ attention. Self-cleaving intein mediated single column purification is one of these novel approaches. Self-cleaving inteins are modified forms of natural inteins that can excise and join only at one junction site.

Expression was confirmed by western blot analysis. The fusion protein containing uricase-intein-CBD was purified on a chitin column. The cleavage was induced by adding DTT,1 as a reducing agent to release uricase. The purity of uricase and complete excision of the intein and CBD were confirmed by SDS-PAGE2 while its proper folding was proved by circular dichroism and fluorescent emission studies. Isoelectric focusing further confirmed its homogeneity when a single protein band was observed at the predicted pI value.

Nowadays the usage of cysteine for the microbial conversion into GSH is industrial state of practice. In the following study, the potential of different inducers to increase the GSH content was evaluated by means of design of experiments methodology. Investigations were executed in three natural Saccharomyces strains, S. cerevisiae, S. bayanus and S. boulardii, in a well suited 50 ml shake tube system. Results of shake tube experiments were confirmed in traditional baffled shake flasks and finally via batch cultivation in lab-scale bioreactors under controlled conditions. Comprehensive studies showed that the usage of cysteine ethyl ester (CEE) for the batch-wise biotransformation into GSH led up to a more than 2.2 times higher yield compared to cysteine as inducer. Additionally, the intracellular GSH content could be significantly increased for all strains in terms of 2.29 ± 0.29% for cysteine to 3.65 ± 0.23% for CEE, respectively, in bioreactors. Thus, the usage of CEE provides a highly attractive inducing strategy for the GSH overproduction.",

     "abstract": "Hydrogenases are enzymes that play a key role in controlling excess reducing equivalents in both photosynthetic and anaerobic organisms. This enzyme is viewed as potentially important for the industrial generation of hydrogen gas; however, insufficient hydrogen production has impeded its use in a commercial process. Here, we explore the potential to circumvent this problem by directly evolving the Fe⿿Fe hydrogenase genes from two species of Clostridia bacteria. In addition, a computational model based on these mutant sequences was developed and used as a predictive aid for the isolation of enzymes with even greater efficiency in hydrogen production. Two of the improved mutants have a logarithmic increase in hydrogen production in our in vitro assay. Furthermore, the model predicts hydrogenase sequences with hydrogen productions as high as 540-fold over the positive control. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of directed evolution to improve the native bacterial hydrogenases as a first step for improvement of hydrogenase activity, further in silico prediction, and finally, construction and demonstration of an improved algal hydrogenase in an in vivo assay of C. reinhardtii hydrogen production.",

In this study, we successfully constructed different fusions of GH16 with its original CBM6 and CBM13 derived from Catenovulum agarivorans. The optimum temperature and pH for fusions GH16-CBM6, GH16-CBM13, GH16-CBM6-CBM13 and GH16-CBM13-CBM6 were similar to GH16, at 55 °C and pH 7. All the constructed fusions significantly enhanced the GH16 affinity (Km) and the catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) toward agar. Among them, GH16-CBM6-CBM13 exhibited the highest agarolytic activity, for which Km decreased from 3.67 to 2.11 mg/mL and Kcat/Km increased from 98.6 (mg/mL)⿿1 sec⿿1 to 400.6 (mg/mL)⿿1 sec⿿1. Moreover, all fusions selectively increased GH16 binding ability to agar, in which the highest binding ability of 95% was obtained with fusion GH16-CBM6-CBM13. Melted agar was prehydrolyzed with GH16-CBM6-CBM13, resulting in a degree of liquefaction of 45.3% and reducing sugar yield of 14.2%. Further addition of Saccharophagus degradans agarolytic enzymes resulted in mono-sugar yields of 35.4% for galactose and 31.5% for 3,6-anhydro-l-galactose.

To the best of our knowledge, there are no assay methods for the direct characterization of LPMOs that degrade substrates without coupled enzymes. As such, in this study, a coupled enzyme-free assay method for LPMOs was developed, which is based on measuring the consumption of ascorbic acid used as an external electron donor for LPMOs. To establish this new assay method, a chitin-active LPMO from Bacillus atrophaeus (BatLPMO10) was cloned as a model enzyme. An expression system using B. subtilis as the host cell yielded a simple purification process without complicated periplasmic fractionation, as well as improved productivity by 3.7-fold higher than that of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). At the optimum pH determined using a newly developed assay, BatLPMO10 showed the highest activity in terms of promoting chitin degradation by a chitinase. In addition, the assay method indicated that BatLPMO10 was inhibited by sodium ions, and BatLPMO10 and a chitinase mutually enhanced each other’s activities upon degrading chitin as the substrate. In conclusion, this hydrolase-free ascorbate assay allows quantitative analysis of BatLPMO10 without a coupled enzyme.",

All six of the recombinant xylanases with the addition of CBM in the pIVEX-GST expression vector showed no improved PX3 hydrolytic activity. However, the absence of the CBM domain resulted in a decrement of 40% in thermostability, movement of the optimal temperature from 55 °C to 45 °C, alteration of the optimal pH range from 5⿿10 to 6⿿8, and reduction of the enzymatic activity to one-second under the same condition, respectively.

Substitution of Q114 with a hydrophobic methionine to yield mutant Q114M increased enantioselectivity (3.2-fold) and marginally improved reactivity (1.4-fold) of the lipase in catalysing esterification of ibuprofen with oleyl alcohol. The improved catalytic efficiency of Q114L was concomitant with reduced flexibility in the active site while the decreased enantioselectivity of Q114L could be directly attributed to diminished electrostatic repulsion of the substrate carboxylate ion that rendered partial loss in steric hindrance and thus enantioselectivity. The highest E-values for both Q114L (E-value 14.6) and Q114M (E-value 48.5) mutant lipases were attained at 50 °C, after 12⿿16 h, with a molar ratio of oleyl alcohol to ibuprofen of 1.5:1 and at 2.0% (w/v) enzyme load without addition of molecular sieves. Pertinently, site-directed mutagenesis on the Q114 oxyanion of T1 resulted in improved enantioselectivity and such approach may be applicable to other lipases of the same family. We demonstrated that electrostatic repulsion phenomena could affect flexibility/rigidity of the enzyme-substrate complex, aspects vital for enzyme activity and enantioselectivity of T1.",

This study investigated the growth and metabolism response of Aurantiochytrium sp.

Herein, five carbonyl reductases from different Streptomyces were discovered by the strategy of genome mining. These reductases were overexpressed, and we chose SgCR for further study as it owned better enzyme activity. This protein was purified to apparent homogeneity, and its amino acid sequence was analyzed in comparison with that of the reported SDRs. The biocatalytic properties of SgCR were investigated, and this enzyme was confirmed to have the ability to convert various prochiral ketones into highly optically active alcohols. SgCR exhibited the highest activity towards ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (COBE) and the corresponding product ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate ((S)-CHBE) was obtained with high yield and excellent e.e. value by optimizing the biphasic system. Eventually, using isopropanol as the co-substrate for NADH recycling in the substrate-coupled reaction, the yield and enantioselectivity of (S)-CHBE were obtained at the values of 90% and 99%, respectively.

Here we extended our study by measuring the proteolytic resistance, long term and thermal stability as well as unfolding kinetics of these variants. Long term stability data at 4 and 25 °C for 3 weeks indicates that all mutants remain considerably active at 4 °C. Thermoinactivation rates for all variants shows that the wild type (WT) enzyme retained 50% of its activity after 2 min keeping at 40 °C, while L701T, H700N and H700N/L701T as conformationally stabilized variants, have slower inactivation rate. It was also found that compact and thermodynamically stabilized variants are more resistant to tryptolytic digestion. Also, kinetic curves of chemical unfolding of the enzyme variants from stopped-flow fluorescence measurements were best fitted into a three-exponential function with three rate constants and corresponding amplitudes. We found that the energy barrier of the fast unfolding phase is lower in stabilized variants; while the amplitude of this phase to the whole amplitude of the unfolding reaction is lower than that of destabilized variants, indicating more population of stabilized mutants unfold via slower unfolding phase. We concluded that the rate of local conformational change alone is not the same that is expected from global thermodynamic stability; however the corresponding amplitude can compensate the rate constant toward thermodynamic stability.",

AuNPs found to have characteristic absorption maxima centered at 540 nm, multiple irregular shapes with size range from 20 to 50 nm and have crystalline nature. Latex fabricated AuNPs were found to inhibit catalytic potential of trypsin (a vital enzyme responsible for digestion, insecticide resistance and in several disease conditions). The interactions between AuNPs and trypsin were analyzed by UV–vis spectrophotometry and microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometry which suggests formation of trypsin-AuNPs complex responsible for lowering catalytic activity of trypsin. Transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and particle size distribution studies further confirm complex formation between trypsin and AuNPs. Diverse interactions of metal nanoparticles with proteins such as covalent interaction, electrostatic interactions and binding to SH group of amino acid may be the reasons behind inhibition of trypsin activity.

Growth and fermentation of S. cerevisiae in the carob-whey medium showed an inhibition of about 30% in comparison with water-extracted carob. The inhibition of K. lactis on carob-whey was greater (70%) when compared with the whey medium alone, due to osmolarity problems. Oxygen availability was a very important factor for K. lactis, influencing its fermentation performance. When K. lactis was grown alone on carob-whey medium, lactose was always consumed first, and glucose and fructose were consumed afterwards, only at high aeration conditions. In co-culture with S. cerevisiae, K. lactis was completely inhibited and, at low aeration, died after 3 days; at high aeration this culture could survive but growth and lactose fermentation were only recovered after S. cerevisiae became stationary. To overcome the osmolarity and K. lactis’ oxygen problems, the medium had to be diluted and a sequential fermentative process was designed in a STR–3l reactor. K. lactis was inoculated first and, with low aeration (0.13 vvm), consumed all the lactose in 48 h. Then S. cerevisiae was inoculated, consuming the total of the carob sugars, and producing ethanol in a fed-batch regime. The established co-culture with K. lactis increased S. cerevisiae ethanol tolerance. This fermentation process produced ethanol with good efficiency (80 g/l final concentration and a conversion factor of 0.4 g ethanol/g sugar), eliminating all the sugars of the mixed waste. These efficient fermentative results pointed to a new joint treatment of agro-industrial wastes which may be implemented successfully, with economic and environmental sustainability for a bioethanol industrial proposal.",

Because of its high pullulan production, sucrose proved to be the best carbon source for pullulan synthesis by A. pullulans CGMCC1234 (36.3 g/L). Compared to other carbon sources, A. pullulans cells reached the stationary phase more quickly in the presence of sucrose. The specific sugar types and concentrations occurring during pullulan fermentation were detected using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). HPLC results revealed that sucrose did not simply break down into glucose and fructose in the medium employed. Kestose (22.69 g/L) also accumulated during early stages of fermentation (24 h), which reduced the osmotic pressure of the extracellular fluid and diminished the inhibition of cell growth and pullulan production. β-Fructofuranosidase activity strongly depended on the carbon source.

     "abstract": "A novel s erine p rotease from T richoderma k oningii (SPTK) was synthesized and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant SPTK was completely inhibited by phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), suggesting that SPTK belonged to the subgroup of serine proteases. The optimum pH and temperature for the recombinant SPTK reaction were 6.0 and 55 °C, respectively. SPTK performed a tolerance to most organic solvents and metal ions, and the addition of Triton X-100 exhibited an activation of SPTK up to 243% of its initial activity but SDS strongly inhibited. Moreover, our study showed that a portion of SPTK was N-glycosylated during fermentation. The activity and thermal stability of the recombinant SPTK were improved after the removal of glycosylation, and the N-glycosylation of SPTK could be efficiently removed through co-culture with P. pastoris strains expressing Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. We constructed expression vectors harboring from one to four repeats of Sptk-expressing cassettes via an in vitro BioBrick assembly approach. And the result of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) indicated that the tandem expression cassettes were integrated into the genome of P. pastoris through a single recombination event. These strains were used to study the correlation between the gene copy number and the expression level of SPTK. The results of qPCR and enzyme activity assays indicated that the copy number variation of Sptk gene generally had a positive effect on the expression level of SPTK, while an increase in integration of target gene did not guarantee its high expression. The maximum yield and specific activity of SPTK in P. pastoris were obtained from the recombinant yeast strain harboring two-copy tandem Sptk-expressing cassettes, the yield reached 0.48 g/l after a 6-d induction using menthol in shake flasks and 3.2 g/l in high-density fermentation with specific activity of 5200 U/mg. In addition, the recombinant SPTK could efficiently degrade chicken feather and hydrolyzed the gelatin layer of photographic film. These properties made the recombinant SPTK a suitable candidate for industrial applications and for eliminating the pollution of keratin.",

     "abstract": "The bacterial expansin, BsEXLX1, has been studied as a model to understand the synergistic effect of expansins on lignocellulose degradation and the structure-function relationships of expansins. However, the specific mechanism is still poorly understood. In this study, the binding, synergistic and structural characteristics of BsEXLX1 for loosening the main components of lignocellulose: lignin, xylan, and cellulose, were further characterized. Results showed that BsEXLX1 preferentially binds to xylan over lignin or cellulose under various conditions. The binding of BsEXLX1 to all substrates increased linearly with the initial concentration of BsEXLX1. But the changing rate of binding (i.e., slope of the line; k value) varied with the incubation temperature. Interestingly, the binding of BsEXLX1 to substrates did not saturate. Mutating residue-125, 126 or 171 indicated their importance for binding, but they were less important for binding to xylan. Through binding assays and homologous modeling, it was concluded that residue-125 and 171 play more important roles in the structural maintenance of BsEXLX1. By comparing the synergistic activity of BsEXLX1 or its mutants, it was found that synergistic activity is not correlated with specific binding. All these results can lead deeper understand about the mechanism of wall loosening by expansins, and further promote the application of expansins in lignocellulose degradation.",

CSB39, isolated from popular traditional Korean food (Kimchi), produced a low molecular weight, thermostable mannanase (MnCSB39); 571.14 U/mL using locust bean gum galactomannan as a major substrate. It was purified to homogeneity using a simple and effective two-step purification strategy, Sepharose CL-6B and DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow, which resulted in 25.47% yield and 19.32-fold purity. The surfactant-, NaCl-, urea-, and protease-tolerant monomeric protein had a mass of ∼30 kDa as analyzed by SDS-PAGE and galactomannan zymography. MnCSB39 was found to have optimal activity at pH 7.5 and temperature of 70 °C. The enzyme showed ˃55% activity at 5.0–15% (w/v) NaCl, and ˃93% of the initial activity after incubation at 37 °C for 60 min. Trypsin and proteinase K had no effect on MnCBS39. The enzyme showed ˃80% activity in up to 3 M urea. The N-terminal amino acid sequence, ALKGDGX, did not show identity with reported mannanases, which suggests the novelty of our enzyme. Activation energy for galactomannan hydrolysis was 26.85 kJmol−1 with a Kcat of 142.58 × 104 s−1. MnCSB39 had Km and Vmax values of 0.082 mg/mL and 1099 ± 1.0 Umg−1, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters such as ΔH, ΔG, ΔS, Q10, ΔGE-S, and ΔGE-T supported the spontaneous formation of products and the high hydrolytic efficiency and feasibility of the enzymatic reaction, which strengthen its novelty. MnCSB39 activity was affected by metal ions, modulators, chelators, and detergents. Mannobiose was the principal end-product of hydrolysis. Bacillus subtilis CSB39 produced a maximum of 1524.44 U mannanase from solid state fermentation of 1 g wheat bran.

The sensing scheme was based on the colorimetric measurement of ammonia formation using the Nessler’s reagent. This format is ideal for micro-volume applications and allows the use of the proposed biosensor in high-throughput applications for monitoring l-asparagine levels in serum and foods samples.

In this study, a sialic acid aldolase (PdNAL) from Peptoclostridium difficile NAP08 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). This homotetrameric enzyme was purified with a specific activity of 18.34 U/mg for the cleavage of Neu5Ac. The optimal pH and temperature for aldol addition reaction were 7.4 and 65 °C, respectively. PdNAL was quite stable at neutral and alkaline pH (6.0–10.0) and maintained about 89% of the activity after incubation at pH 10.0 for 24 h. After incubation at 70 °C for 15 min, almost no activity loss was observed. The high thermostability simplified the purification of this enzyme. Interestingly, substrate profiling showed that PdNAL not only accepted ManNAc but also short chain aliphatic aldehydes such as acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde and n-butyraldehyde as the substrates. This is the first example that a sialic acid aldolase is active toward aliphatic aldehyde acceptors with two or more carbons. The amino acid sequence analysis indicates that PdNAL belongs to the NAL subfamily rather than 4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate (HOPA) aldolase, but it is interesting that the enzyme possesses the activity of HOPA aldolase.",

In addition, A. pernix CR exhibited high stability at a wider range of pH values and longer periods of storage compared with CRs previously identified from other sources. A. pernix CR catalyzed the reduction of various carbonyl compounds including ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate and 9,10-phenanthrenequinone, similar to the CR from thyroidectomized (Tx) chicken fatty liver. However, A. pernix CR exhibited significantly higher Km values against several substrates than Tx chicken fatty liver CR. The three-dimensional structure of A. pernix CR was determined using the molecular replacement method at a resolution of 2.09 Å, in the presence of NADPH. The overall fold of A. pernix CR showed moderate similarity to that of Tx chicken fatty liver CR; however, A. pernix CR had no active-site lid unlike Tx chicken fatty liver CR. Consequently, the active-site cavity in the A. pernix CR was much more solvent-accessible than that in Tx chicken fatty liver CR. This structural feature may be responsible for the enzyme’s lower affinity for several substrates and NADPH. The factors contributing to the much higher thermostability of A. pernix CR were analyzed by comparing its structure with that of Tx chicken fatty liver CR. This comparison showed that extensive formation of the intrasubunit ion pair networks, and the presence of the strong intersubunit interaction, is likely responsible for A. pernix CR thermostability.

In this study, six FmEG derivatives with deletion of N-terminal fragments or fusion with an extra family 1 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM1) was constructed in order to evaluate the contribution of CBM1 to FmEG processivity and catalytic activity. FmEG showed a weak processivity and released cellobiose (G2) and cellotriose (G3) as main end products, and cellotriose (G4) as minor end product from filter paper (FP), but more amount of G4 was released from regenerated amorphous cellulose (RAC). All derivatives had similar activity on carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) with the same optimal pH (7.0) and temperature (50 °C). However, fusing an extra CBM1 to FmEG△24 or FmEG△37 with flexible peptide significantly improved its processivity and catalytic activity to FP and RAC. Overall, 1.79- and 1.84-fold increases in the soluble/insoluble product ratio on FP, and 1.38- and 1.39-fold increases on RAC, compared to FmEG△24, were recorded for CBM1-FmEG△24 and CBM1-linker-FmEG△24, respectively.

Interestingly, fusion of an extra CBM1 with FmEG also caused an alteration of cleavage pattern on insoluble celluloses. Our results suggest that such improvements in processivity and catalytic activity may arise from CBM1 binding affinity. The N-terminal 24- or 37-amino acids may serve as linker for sufficient spatial separation of the two domains required for processivity and catalytic activity.

The FDH activity could be inhibited to different extents by some transition metal ions and anions. Moreover, the E. coli cells expressing FDH showed different tolerance to solvents. The recombinant whole cell exhibited high formate specificity. Finally, the E. coli cell expressing FDH was used to assay formate with a wide linear range of 5–700 μM and a low limit of detection of 2 μM. It is anticipated that the genetically engineered cells may have a broad application in biosensors, biofuels and cofactor regeneration system.",

     "abstract": "Polysaccharides are natural biopolymers found in almost all living organisms. They are used extensively in various industrial applications, such as food, adhesives, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. In many cases, their practical use is limited because of their weak solubility in neutral pH, their unsuitable hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance. In this context, chemical or enzymatic modification of their structure appears as a relevant way, to improve their properties, and thus to enlarge the field of their potential applications. Taking into account the reduction of the input energy and the environmental impact, and due to high specificity and selectivity properties, enzymatic bioprocesses have been investigated as attractive alternatives to toxic and non-specific chemical approaches. This review discusses the methods of enzymatic functionalization of four well-known polysaccharides, chitosan, cellulose, pectin and starch.Particular emphasis was placed on the methods, the reaction types and the enzymes implicated in the modification such as laccases, peroxidases lipases, tyrosinases, and transglutaminases. The impact of functionalization on the properties and the applications of polysaccharide derivatives were described.",

An extracellular β-agarase (AgaA7) recently isolated from Pseudoalteromonas hodoensis sp. nov was expressed in Bacillus subtilis, which was chosen due to its capability to overproduce and secrete functional enzymes. Phenotypic analysis showed that the engineered B. subtilis secreted a functional AgaA7 when fused with the aprE signal peptide (SP) at the amino-terminus. The maximum agarolytic activity was observed during the late logarithmic phase. To further improve the secretion of AgaA7, an expression library of AgaA7 fused to different naturally occurring B. subtilis SPs was created. The amount of AgaA7 secreted by the clones was compared through activity assay, immuno-blot, and purification via affinity chromatography. Although the aprE SP can readily facilitate the secretion of AgaA7, other SPs such as yqgA, pel, and lipA were relatively more efficient. Among these SPs, lipA was the most efficient in improving the secretion of AgaA7.The use of B. subtilis as host for the expression and secretion of agarolytic and other hydrolytic enzymes can be a useful tool in the field of white biotechnology.",

Entrapment was achieved by utilizing the strong self-aggregation tendency of GMC in aqueous buffer solution to form carbon networks. Using confocal microscopy and TEM, GOx-GMC nanocomposites were visualized. The electrochemical properties of GOx-GMC nanocomposites were studied by means of cyclic voltammograms, chronoamperometric and potentiostatic tests. Results therefrom suggested that the GOx-GMC nanocomposites offer a high electrical conductivity with the maximum electron transfer rate constant estimated at 5.16 ± 0.61 s−1. Furthermore, thermally treating the GOx-GMC nanocomposite and GOx aggregates at 60 °C for four hours, both samples maintained 99% of their initial activity, while the free GOx were completely deactivated. These performances suggested that our nanocomposite structure offered both improved electrochemical performance and stability by combining the high electrical conductivity offered by the GMC network with the high enzyme loading and stability offered by the cross-linked GOx aggregates. The GOx-GMC nanocomposite’s electrochemical activity towards glucose oxidation was also investigated by using an enzymatic biofuel cell without artificial mediators, producing a power density of up to 22.4 μW cm−2 at 0.24 V.",

     "abstract": "Industrial use of Novozym 435 in synthesis of structured lipids and biodiesel via alcoholysis is limited by mass transfer effects of the glycerides through immobilized enzymes and its low operational stability under operation conditions. To better understand this, differently modified Novozym 435 preparations, differing in their surface nature and in their interactions with reactants, have been compared in the alcoholysis of Camelina sativa oil. The three modifications performed have been carried out under conditions where all exposed groups of the enzyme have been modified. These modifications were: 2,4,6-trinitrobenzensulfonic acid (Novo-TNBS), ethylendiamine (Novo-EDA) and polyethylenimine (Novo-PEI). Changes in their operational performance are analyzed in terms of changes detected by scan electron microscopy in the support morphology.The hydrophobic nature of the TNBS accelerates the reaction rate; t-ButOH co-solvent swells the macroporous acrylic particles of Lewatit VP OC 1600 in all biocatalysts, except in the case of Novo-PEI. This co-solvent only increases the maximal conversions obtained at 24 h using the modified biocatalysts. t-ButOH reduces enzyme inactivation by alcohol and water. In a co-solvent system, these four biocatalysts remain fully active after 14 consecutive reaction cycles of 24 h, but only Novo-TNBS yields maximal conversion before cycle 5. Some deposits on biocatalyst particles could be appreciated during reuses, and TNBS derivatization diminishes the accumulation of product deposits on the catalyst surface. Most particles of commercial Novozym® 435 are broken after operation for 14 reaction cycles. The broken particles are fully active, but they cause problems of blockage in filtration operations and column reactors. The three derivatizations studied make the matrix particles more resistant to rupture.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this work was to investigate the interaction between E.coli and Streptomyces coelicolor A3 (2) for the increased production of undecylprodigiosin and identify the E. coli actives mediating this inter-species interaction. The antibiotics of interest were the red-pigmented undecylprodigiosin and blue-pigmented actinorhodin. Pure cultures of S. coelicolor in a defined medium produced higher concentrations of actinorhodin compared to those of undecylprodigiosin. The latter however, is more important due to its immunosuppressive and antitumor properties. As a strategy to increase undecylprodigiosin production, we added separately, live cells and heat-killed cells of E. coli C600, and the cell-free supernatant of E. coli culture to S. coelicolor cultures in shake flasks. The interaction with live cells of E. coli altered the antibiotic production pattern and undecylprodigiosin production was enhanced by 3.5-fold compared to the pure cultures of S. coelicolor and actinorhodin decreased by 15-fold. The heat-killed cells of E. coli however, had no effect on antibiotic production. In all cases, growth and glucose consumption of S. coelicolor remained almost the same as those observed in the pure culture indicating that the changes in antibiotic production were not due to nutritional stress. Results with cell-free supernatant of E. coli culture indicated that the interaction between S. coelicolor and E. coli was mediated via diffusible molecule(s). Using a set of extraction procedures and agar-well diffusion bioassays, we isolated and preliminarily identified a class of compounds. For the preliminary verification, we added the compound which was the common chemical structural moiety in this class of compounds to the pure S. coelicolor cultures. We observed similar effects on antibiotic production as with the live E. coli cells and their supernatant indicating that this class of compounds secreted by E. coli indeed could act as actives during interspecies interaction and increase the production of undecylprodigiosin.",

     "abstract": "Cellulases and hemicellulases from Trichoderma reesei and Aspergillus niger have been shown to be powerful enzymes for biomass conversion to sugars, but the production costs are still relatively high for commercial application. The choice of an effective microbial cultivation process employed for enzyme production is important, since it may affect titers and the profile of protein secretion. We used proteomic analysis to characterize the secretome of T. reesei and A. niger cultivated in submerged and sequential fermentation processes. The information gained was key to understand differences in hydrolysis of steam exploded sugarcane bagasse for enzyme cocktails obtained from two different cultivation processes. The sequential process for cultivating A. niger gave xylanase and β-glucosidase activities 3- and 8-fold higher, respectively, than corresponding activities from the submerged process. A greater protein diversity of critical cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes were also observed through secretome analyses. These results helped to explain the 3-fold higher yield for hydrolysis of non-washed pretreated bagasse when combined T. reesei and A. niger enzyme extracts from sequential fermentation were used in place of enzymes obtained from submerged fermentation. An enzyme loading of 0.7 FPU cellulase activity/g glucan was surprisingly effective when compared to the 5–15 times more enzyme loadings commonly reported for other cellulose hydrolysis studies. Analyses showed that more than 80% consisted of proteins other than cellulases whose role is important to the hydrolysis of a lignocellulose substrate. Our work combined proteomic analyses and enzymology studies to show that sequential and submerged cultivation methods differently influence both titers and secretion profile of key enzymes required for the hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse. The higher diversity of feruloyl esterases, xylanases and other auxiliary hemicellulolytic enzymes observed in the enzyme mixtures from the sequential fermentation could be one major reason for the more efficient enzyme hydrolysis that results when using the combined secretomes from A. niger and T. reesei.",

Neither medium concentrations (10, 20, 30 mM) malic acid nor individual ultrasound (25 kHz, 55.48 W/cm2) treatment could remarkably inactivate PPO. However, the inactivation during their combination was more significant than the sum of ultrasound inactivation and malic acid inactivation. The inactivation kinetics of PPO followed a first-order kinetics under the combination of ultrasound and malic acid. The conformation of combination treated PPO was changed, which was reflected in the decrease of α-helix, increase of β-sheet contents and disruption of the tertiary structure. Results of molecular microstructure showed that ultrasound broke large molecular groups of PPO into small ones.

For P. variabile, the best elicitor was salicylic acid at 50 mg/l which gave a taxol yield of 14.7 ± 4.8 μg/l. The study of synergistic effects between elicitor, aw and pH on taxol production showed that the highest yield of taxol (68.9 ± 11.9 μg/l) was produced under modified ionic stress of 0.98 aw (KCl) at pH 5 when supplemented with 20 mg/l of salicylic acid. For E. nigrum, serine was the best elicitor which increased yield significantly (29.6 fold) when KCL was used as the aw depressor (0.98 aw) at pH 5.0 with 30 mg/l of serine. The maximum taxol yield produced by E. nigrum was 57.1 ± 11.8 μg/l. Surface response models were used to build contour maps to determine the conditions for maximum and marginal conditions for taxol yield in relation to the best elicitor and aw, and the best pH for the first time.

The immobilization efficiency was estimated taking into consideration the choline oxidase activity, which was assessed by using cadmium telluride (CdTe) quantum dots (QDs), obtained by hydrothermal synthesis, as photoluminescent probes. Hydrogen peroxide produced by enzyme activity was capable of quenching CdTe QDs photoluminescence. The magnitude of the PL quenching process was directly related with the enzyme activity.By comparing the chemical process with the physical adsorption, it was observed that the latter provided the highest choline oxidase immobilization. The equilibrium data were analyzed using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and kinetic data were fitted to the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models. Thermodynamic parameters, such as Gibbs free energy and entropy were also calculated. These results will certainly contribute to the development of new sensing schemes for choline, taking into account the growing demand for its quantification in biological samples.",

It is therefore interesting to explore their biochemistry to better understand fungal biology and to enable the use of fungal enzymes in the biotechnology sector. In the present study, we developed heterologous expression systems for CYP5136A1 and CYP5136A3 using the T7 RNA polymerase/promoter system in Escherichia coli. Expression levels of recombinant P450s were dramatically improved by modifications and optimization of their N-terminal amino acid sequences. A CYP5136A1 reaction system was reconstructed in E. coli whole cells by coexpression of CYP5136A1 and a redox partner, NADPH-dependent P450 reductase (CPR). The catalytic activity of CYP5136A1 was significantly increased when cytochrome b5 (Cyt-b5) was further coexpressed with CPR, indicating that Cyt-b5 supports electron transfer reactions from NAD(P)H to CYP5136A1. Notably, P450 reaction occurred in E. coli cells that harbored CYP5136A1 and Cyt-b5 but not CPR, implying that the reducing equivalents required for the P450 catalytic cycle were transferred via a CPR-independent pathway. Such an “alternative” electron transfer system in CYP5136A1 reaction was also demonstrated using purified enzymes in vitro. The fungal P450 reaction system may be associated with sophisticated electron transfer pathways.",

The hydrolysates of konjac glucomannan (H-KGM), locust bean gum (H-LBG) and defatted copra meal (H-DCM) composed of compounds which were different in their molecular weight range from mannobiose to mannohexaose and unknown oligosaccharides indicating the endo action of mannanase. Both H-DCM and H-LBG enhanced the growth of lactic acid bacteria and some pathogens except Escherichia coli E010 with a specific growth rate of 0.36–0.83 h−1. H-LBG was more specific to 3 species of Weissella confusa JCM 1093, Lactobacillus reuteri KUB-AC5, Lb salivarius KL-D4 and E. coli E010 while both H-KGM and H-DCM were to Lb. reuteri KUB-AC5 and Lb. johnsonii KUNN19-2. Based on the nucleotide sequence of kman-2 containing two open reading frames of 1 and 2 at 5′ end of the +1 and +43, respectively, removal of the first open reading frame provided the recombinant clone E. coli KMAN-3 resulting in the mature protein of mannanase composing of 345 amino acid residues confirmed by 3D structure analysis and amino acid sequence at N-terminal namely KMAN (GenBank accession number KM100456). It exhibited 10 times higher extracellular and periplasmic total activities of 17,600 and 14,800 units than E. coli KMAN-2. With its low similarity to mannanases previously proposed, wide range of homo- and hetero-polysaccharide specificity, negative effect to E. coli and most importance of high production, it would be proposed as a novel mannanase source for application in the future.",

So far, instability of immobilized NR due to the use of inappropriate immobilization matrices has limited the practical applications of these devices. Present study is an attempt to improve the kinetic properties and stability of NR using nanoscale iron oxide (nFe3O4) and zinc oxide (nZnO) particles. The desired nanoparticles were synthesized, surface functionalized, characterized and affixed onto the epoxy resin to yield two nanocomposite supports (epoxy/nFe3O4 and epoxy/nZnO) for immobilizing NR. Epoxy/nFe3O4 and epoxy/nZnO support could load as much as 35.8 ± 0.01 and 33.20 ± 0.01 μg/cm2 of NR with retention of about 93.72 ± 0.50 and 84.81 ± 0.80% of its initial activity respectively. Changes in surface morphology and chemical bonding structure of both the nanocomposite supports after addition of NR were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Optimum working conditions of pH, temperature and substrate concentration were ascertained for free as well as immobilized NR preparations. Further, storage stability at 4 °C and thermal stability between 25–50 °C were determined for all the NR preparations. Analytical applications of immobilized NR for determination of soil and water nitrates along with reusability data has been included to make sure the usefulness of the procedure.",

The mutation sites were distributed at the catalytic center of the enzyme (T33A, G34A, Y75H, T77A, Y189H, V214A, G217A and S219A) and at its active site (D32A and D215A) for protein digestion. Mutation of the active site residues Asp32 and Asp215 led to the inactivation of pepsin (both the NA and protein digestion activity), which demonstrated that the active sites of the pepsin protease activity were also important for its nuclease activity. Analysis of the variants revealed that T33A and G217A mutants showed a complete loss of NA digestion activity. In conclusion, residues Asp32, Thr33, Asp215 and Gly217 were related to the pepsin active sites for NA digestion. Moreover, the Y189H and V214A variants showed a loss of digestion activity on double-strand DNA (dsDNA) but only a decrease in digestion activity on single-strand DNA (ssDNA). On the contrary, the G34A variant showed a loss of digestion activity on ssDNA but only a decrease in digestion activity on dsDNA.

     "abstract": "Improvement of thermostability in engineered enzymes can allow biocatalysis on substrates with poor aqueous solubility. Denaturation of the cofactor-binding loops of Escherichia coli transketolase (TK) was previously linked to the loss of enzyme activity under conditions of high pH or urea. Incubation at temperatures just below the thermal melting transition, above which the protein aggregates, was also found to anneal the enzyme to give an increased specific activity. The potential role of cofactor-binding loop instability in this process remained unclear. In this work, the two cofactor-binding loops (residues 185–192 and 382–392) were progressively mutated towards the equivalent sequence from the thermostable Thermus thermophilus TK and variants assessed for their impact on both thermostability and activity. Cofactor-binding loop 2 variants had detrimental effects on specific activity at elevated temperatures, whereas the H192P mutation in cofactor-binding loop 1 resulted in a two-fold improved stability to inactivation at elevated temperatures, and increased the critical onset temperature for aggregation. The specific activity of H192P was 3-fold and 19-fold higher than that for wild-type at 60 °C and 65 °C respectively, and also remained 2.7-4 fold higher after re-cooling from pre-incubations at either 55 °C or 60 °C for 1 h. Interestingly, H192P was also 2-times more active than wild-type TK at 25 °C. Optimal activity was achieved at 60 °C for H192P compared to 55 °C for wild type. These results show that cofactor-binding loop 1, plays a pivotal role in partial denaturation and aggregation at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, a single rigidifying mutation within this loop can significantly improve the enzyme specific activity, as well as the stability to thermal denaturation and aggregation, to give an increased temperature optimum for activity.",

GH1 β-glucosidase adsorption onto lignins was found to be strongly pH-dependent, suggesting that the adsorption is electrostatically modulated. For GH3 β-glucosidase, the results suggested that the fibronectin type III-like domain interacts with lignins through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that can partially, or completely, overcome repulsive electrostatic forces between the catalytic domain and lignins. Finally, the increase of temperature did not result in the increase of β-glucosidases adsorption, probably because there is no significant increase in hydrophobic regions in the β-glucosidases structures.

     "abstract": "One prominent feature of Trichoderma reesei (Tr) endoglucanases catalyzed cellulose hydrolysis is that the reaction slows down quickly after it starts (within minutes). But the mechanism of the slowdown is not well understood. A structural model of Tr- Cel7B catalytic domain bound to cellulose was built computationally and the potentially important binding residues were identified and tested experimentally. The 13 tested mutants show different binding properties in the adsorption to phosphoric acid swollen cellulose and filter paper. Though the partitioning parameter to filter paper is about 10 times smaller than that to phosphoric acid swollen cellulose, a positive correlation is shown for two substrates. The kinetic studies show that the reactions slow down quickly for both substrates. This slowdown is not correlated to the binding constant but anticorrelated to the enzyme initial activity. The amount of reducing sugars released after 24 h by Cel7B in phosphoric acid swollen cellulose, Avicel and filter paper cellulose hydrolysis is correlated with the enzyme activity against a soluble substrate p-nitrophenyl lactoside. Six of the 13 tested mutants, including N47A, N52D, S99A, N323D, S324A, and S346A, yield ∼15–35% more reducing sugars than the wild type (WT) Cel7B in phosphoric acid swollen cellulose and filter paper hydrolysis. This study reveals that the slowdown of the reaction is not due to the binding of the enzyme to cellulose. The activity of Tr- Cel7B against the insoluble substrate cellulose is determined by the enzyme’s capability in hydrolyzing the soluble substrate.",

     "abstract": "Enzymatic cascade reactions, i.e. the combination of several enzyme reactions in one pot without isolation of intermediates, have great potential for the establishment of sustainable chemical processes. However, many cascade reactions suffer from cross-inhibitions and enzyme inactivation by components of the reaction system. This study focuses on the two-step enzymatic synthesis of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) using an N-acyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase from Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 (AvaAGE) in combination with an N-acetylneuraminate lyase (NAL) from Escherichia coli. AvaAGE epimerizes N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) to N-acetyl-d-mannosamine (ManNAc), which then reacts with pyruvate in a NAL-catalyzed aldol condensation to form Neu5Ac. However, AvaAGE is inactivated by high pyruvate concentrations, which are used to push the NAL reaction toward the product side. A biphasic inactivation was observed in the presence of 50–800 mM pyruvate resulting in activity losses of the AvaAGE of up to 60% within the first hour. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that pyruvate modifies one of the four lysine residues in the ATP-binding site of AvaAGE. Because ATP is an allosteric activator of the epimerase and the binding of the nucleotide is crucial for its catalytic properties, saturation mutagenesis at position K160 was performed to identify the most compatible amino acid exchanges. The best variants, K160I, K160N and K160L, showed no inactivation by pyruvate, but significantly impaired kinetic parameters. For example, depending on the mutant, the turnover number kcat was reduced by 51–68% compared with the wild-type enzyme. A mechanistic model of the Neu5Ac synthesis was established, which can be used to select the AvaAGE variant that is most favorable for a given process condition. The results show that mechanistic models can greatly facilitate the choice of the right enzyme for an enzymatic cascade reaction with multiple cross-inhibitions and inactivation phenomena.",

In this study, ppc and lysC were co-expressed with ido to increase the supply of Ile, the direct precursor of 4-HIL, and to further improve the 4-HIL yield. After 144 h of fermentation, the ido-ppc-expressing strain produced 95.72 ± 1.52 mM 4-HIL, 29% higher than the ido-expressing strain. The co-expression of lysC and ppc with ido resulted in a further 35% increment of carbon flux to l-aspartate family amino acids biosynthesis pathway. However, the conversion ratio of Ile to 4-HIL and the 4-HIL yield decreased to 0.31 mol/mol and 30.16 ± 2.01 mM, respectively, likely due to the decreased IDO activity caused by lower pH and higher intracellular Ile concentration. Therefore, co-expression of ido and ppc was benefit for 4-HIL de novo biosynthesis, while co-expression of lysC with ido and ppc decreased the conversion ratio of Ile to 4-HIL.",

     "abstract": "Among the natural products, flavonoids have been particularly attractive, highly studied and become one of the most important promising agent to treat cancer, oxidant stress, pathogenic bacteria, inflammations, cardio-vascular dysfunctions, etc. Despite many promising roles of flavonoids, expectations have not been fulfilled when studies were extended to the in vivo condition, particularly in humans. Instability and very low oral bioavailability of dietary flavonoids are the reasons behind this. Researches have demonstrated that the methylation of these flavonoids could increase their promise as pharmaceutical agents leading to novel applications. Methylation of the flavonoids via theirs free hydroxyl groups or C atom dramatically increases their metabolic stability and enhances the membrane transport, leading to facilitated absorption and highly increased oral bioavailability. In this paper, we concentrated on analysis of flavonoid methoxides including O- and C-methoxide derivatives in aspect of structure, bioactivities and description of almost all up-to-date O- and C-methyltransferases’ enzymatic characteristics. Furthermore, modern biological approaches for synthesis and production of flavonoid methoxides using metabolic engineering and synthetic biology have been focused and updated up to 2015. This review will give a handful information regarding the methylation of flavonoids, methyltransferases and biotechnological synthesis of the same.",

However glutaminase activity is the cause of various side effects when used as a drug against acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Therefore, there is a need of a novel l-asparaginase (L-ASNase) with low or no glutaminase activity. Such a property has been observed with L-ASNase from B. licheniformis (BliA). The enzyme being glutaminase free in nature paved the way for its improvement to achieve properties similar to or near to the commercially available L-ASNases. Rational enzyme engineering approach resulted in four mutants: G238N, E232A, D103V and Q112H. Among these the mutant enzyme, D103V, had a specific activity of 597.7 IU/mg, which is higher than native (rBliA) (407.65 IU/mg). Moreover, when the optimum temperature and in vitro half life were studied and compared with native BliA, D103V mutant BliA was better, showing tolerance to higher temperatures and a 3 fold higher half life.

Chimeric ASases were constructed using dgas and npas genes by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction. Two of the six chimeric ASases generated, NPAS-B′ and DGAS-B, showed ASase activity using sucrose as the sole substrate. However, DGAS-B was not able to produce longer α-1,4-glucans; the highest degree of polymerization was <12. In the kinetic study, not only the substrate binding affinity but also the production rate of DGAS-B was greater than those of DGAS. Molecular dynamic computational simulation suggested that DGAS-B could not synthesize longer glucan chains because of the change in flexibilities of loops 4, 7, and 8 as compared to those of DGAS.",

LRR was more thermostable than the wild type but with only 0.02% activity. In this study, site-directed mutagenesis was used to change the proposed ionic bond between the Arg and two neighboring residues (Glu270 and Glu271), to understand if the induced interactions were responsible for inactivation in LRR. Our results showed that substitution of Glu270 and 271 with Ala removed the interactions but the activity of enzyme did not return. The E270A mutant was more active than LRR but the E271A and E270A/E271A mutants were inactive. Fluorescence and CD measurements showed that these mutations were accompanied by conformational changes. Extrinsic fluorescence measurement and obtained quenching data by KI and acrylamide also confirmed that the mutants were less compact than the LRR enzyme. In conclusion, in LRR, the interactions between Arg300 and Glu270 and Glu271 were not responsible for the enzyme inactivation and it is proposed that the enzyme inactivation is due to conformational changes of LRR mutant of firefly luciferase.",

Selective carbohydrate removal by enzymes could increase the protein content and remove the indigestibility of soy products for inclusion in animal feed. Complete hydrolysis of soy flour carbohydrates is challenging due to the presence of proteins and different types of non-structural polysaccharides. This study is designed to guide complex enzyme mixture required for hydrolysis of all types of soy flour carbohydrates. Enzyme broths from Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus aculeatus and Trichoderma reesei fermentations were evaluated in this study for soy carbohydrate hydrolysis. The resultant hydrolysate was measured for solubilized carbohydrate by both total carbohydrate and reducing sugar analyses. Conversion data attained after 48 h hydrolysis were first fitted with models to determine the maximum fractions of carbohydrate hydrolyzable by each enzyme group, i.e., cellulase, xylanase, pectinase and α-galactosidase. Kinetic models were then developed to describe the increasing conversions over time under different enzyme activities and process conditions. The models showed high fidelity in predicting soy carbohydrate hydrolysis over broad ranges of soy flour loading (5–25%) and enzyme activities: per g soy flour, cellulase, 0.04–30 FPU; xylanase, 3.5–618 U; pectinase, 0.03–120 U; and α-galactosidase, 0.01–60 U.

Here we genetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli) for DHA production from glucose. Deletion of E. coli triose phosphate isomerase (tpiA) gene was carried out to accumulate dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), for use as the main intermediate or precursor for DHA production. The accumulated DHAP was then converted to DHA through the heterologous expression of Corynebacterium glutamicum DHAP dephosphorylase (cghdpA) gene. To conserve DHAP exclusively for DHA production we removed methylglyoxal synthase (mgsA) gene in the ΔtpiA strain. This drastically improved DHA production from 0.83 g/l (0.06 g DHA/g glucose) in the ΔtpiA strain bearing cghdpA to 5.84 g/l (0.41 g DHA/g glucose) in the ΔtpiAΔmgsA double mutant containing the same gene. To limit the conversion of intracellular DHA to glycerol, glycerol dehydrogenase (gldA) gene was further knocked out resulting in a ΔtpiAΔmgsAΔgldA triple mutant. This triple mutant expressing the cghdpA gene produced 6.60 g/l of DHA at 87% of the maximum theoretical yield. In summary, we demonstrated an efficient system for DHA production in genetically engineered E. coli strain.",

     "abstract": "A novel cold active esterase, EstLiu was cloned from the marine bacterium Zunongwangia profunda, overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by glutathione-S transferase (GST) affinity chromatography. The mature esterase EstLiu sequence encodes a protein of 273 amino acids residues, with a predicted molecular weight of 30 KDa and containing the classical pentapeptidase motif from position 156 to 160 with the catalytic triad Ser158-Asp211-His243. Although, EstLiu showed 64% similarity with the hypothetical esterase from Chryseobacterium sp. StRB126 (WP_045498424), phylogenetic analysis showed it had no similarity with any of the established family of lipases/esterases, suggesting that it could be considered as a new family. The purified enzyme showed broad substrate specificity with the highest hydrolytic activity against p-nitrophenyl butyrate (C4). EstLiu showed remarkable activity (75%) at 0 °Cand the optimal activity at pH 8.0 and 30 °C with good thermostability and quickened inactivation above 60 °C. EstLiu retained 81, 103, 67 and 78% of its original activity at 50% (v/v) in ethanol, isopropanol, DMSO and ethylene glycol, respectively. In the presence of Tween 20, Tween 80 and Triton X-100, EstLiu showed 88, 100 and 117% of relative activity. It is also co-factor independent. The high activity at low temperature and desirable stability in organic solvents and salts of this novel family esterase represents a good evidence of novel biocatalyst. Overall, this novel enzyme showed better activity than previously reported esterases in extreme reaction conditions and could promote the reaction in both aqueous and non-aqueous conditions, indicating its great potential for industrial applications.",

The optimal activity of BliGO was observed at pH 8.5 and 40 °C. Interestingly, BliGO retained 60% of the maximum activity at 0 °C, suggesting it is a cold-adapted enzyme. The kinetic parameters on glyphosate (Km, kcat and kcat/Km) of BliGO were 11.22 mM, 0.08 s−1, and 0.01 mM−1 s−1, respectively. To improve the catalytic activity to glyphosate, the BliGO was engineered by directed evolution. With error-prone PCR and two rounds of DNA shuffling, the most evolved mutant SCF-4 was obtained from 45,000 colonies, which showed 7.1- and 8-fold increase of affinity (1.58 mM) and catalytic efficiency (0.08 mM−1 s−1) to glyphosate, respectively. In contrast, its activity to glycine (the natural substrate of GO) decreased by 113-fold.

We found that the polymer, PG1-co-PHEDTA, had an important role in ethanol production. In the absence of PG1-co-PHEDTA, ethanol fermentation was severely inhibited by cadmium. However, the inhibitory effect of cadmium could be significantly alleviated by the addition of PG1-co-PHEDTA, and the rates of glucose consumption and ethanol production were similar to those reported for cadmium-free fermentation processes. The investigation into the key units of PG1-co-PHEDTA showed that HEDTA was the contributing factor for the positive effect on ethanol fermentation. However, the effect of HEDTA that was incorporated into PG1 was higher than that of the free HEDTA. Three-fold higher concentration of free HEDTA was required to obtain similar results as that with PG1-co-PHEDTA additive. Glutathione (GSH) and cadmium assays demonstrated that the transport of cadmium into the cell could be prevented by PG1-co-PHEDTA via the formation of a chelated structure with the HEDTA groups in PG1-co-PHEDTA. By applying the unique phase transition of PG1-co-PHEDTA, cadmium of more than 90% could be removed from fermentation broths with a simple centrifugation step.",

Acid treatment of natural sophorolipids results in a mixture of monoacetylated, deacetylated, and diacetylated sophorolipids in acidic and lactonic forms. Isolation of the active components of the mixture, followed by structure determination by MS and NMR, reveals a new chemical entity, in which the lactone ring has been opened at the C-1′ rather than at the C-4″ position of the sophorose moiety. This sophorose ester is resistant to degradation by the host and is at least 28 times more powerful an inducer than sophorose in shake-flask culture. Even at low concentrations (0.05 mM), the chemically modified sophorolipid effectively induces cellulase.

     "abstract": "Glycerol is a major by-product of the biodiesel industry. In this study we report on the metabolic networks involved in its transformation into pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ATP. When the nutritionally-versatile Pseudomonas fluorescens was exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in a mineral medium with glycerol as the sole carbon source, the microbe reconfigured its metabolism to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) primarily via substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP). This alternative ATP-producing stratagem resulted in the synthesis of copious amounts of PEP and pyruvate. The production of these metabolites was mediated via the enhanced activities of such enzymes as pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC). The high energy PEP was subsequently converted into ATP with the aid of pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK), phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (PEPS) and pyruvate kinase (PK) with the concomitant formation of pyruvate. The participation of the phospho-transfer enzymes like adenylate kinase (AK) and acetate kinase (ACK) ensured the efficiency of this O2-independent energy-generating machinery. The increased activity of glycerol dehydrogenase (GDH) in the stressed bacteria provided the necessary precursors to fuel this process. This H2O2-induced anaerobic life-style fortuitously evokes metabolic networks to an effective pathway that can be harnessed into the synthesis of ATP, PEP and pyruvate. The bioconversion of glycerol to pyruvate will offer interesting economic benefit.",

Results showed that neither Novozym 435 nor amide can independently catalyze the reaction. This co-catalytic system that used a catalytic amount of Novozym 435 with a corresponding amount of amide was established and optimized. The MBH reaction strongly depended on the structure of aldehyde substrate, amide co-catalyst, and reaction additives. The optimized reaction yield (43.4%) was achieved in the Novozym 435-catalyzed MBH reaction of 2, 4-dinitrobenzaldehyde and cyclohexenone with isonicotinamide as co-catalyst and β-cyclodextrin as additive only in 2 days. Although enantioselectivity of Novozym 435 was not found, the results were still significant because an MBH reaction using lipase as biocatalyst was realized for the first time.",

Thermal inactivation kinetics suggested that metal ions are quintessential for stabilization of ManB-1601 structure as holoenzyme (Ea 87.4 kcal/mol, ΔH 86.7 kcal/mol, ΔS 186.6 cal/k/mol) displayed better values of thermodynamic parameters compared to metal-depleted ManB-1601 (Ea 47 kcal/mol, ΔH 45.7 kcal/mol, ΔS 64.7 cal/k/mol). EDTA treatment of ManB-1601 not only lead to transitions in both secondary and tertiary structure but also promulgated the population of conformational state that unfolds at lower temperature. ManB-1601 followed a three-state process for thermal inactivation wherein loss of tertiary structure preceded the concurrent loss of secondary structure and activity.",

Functionalized dendrimer-like hierarchically porous silica nanoparticles (HPSNs) was fabricated for assembling β-galactosidase nanobiocatalysts for bioconversion of lactose to galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS). The nanocarrier was functionalized with amino (NH2) and carboxyl (COOH) groups to facilitate enzyme binding, benchmarking with non-functionalized HPSNs. Successful conjugation of the functional groups was confirmed by FTIR, TGA and zeta potential analysis. HPSNs-NH2 showed 1.8-fold and 1.1-fold higher β-galactosidase adsorption than HPSNs-COOH and HPSNs carriers, respectively, with the highest enzyme adsorption capacity of 328 mg/g nanocarrier at an initial enzyme concentration of 8 mg/ml. The HPSNs-NH2 and β-galactosidase assembly (HPSNs-NH2-Gal) demonstrated to maintain the highest activity at all tested enzyme concentrations and exhibited activity up to 10 continuous cycles. Importantly, HPSNs-NH2-Gal was simply recycled through centrifugation, overcoming the challenging problems of separating the nanocarrier from the reaction medium. HPSNs-NH2-Gal had distinguished catalytic reaction profiles by favoring transgalactosylation, enhancing GOS production of up to 122 g/l in comparison with 56 g/l by free β-galactosidase. Furthermore, it generated up to 46 g/l GOS at a lower initial lactose concentration while the free counterpart had negligible GOS production as hydrolysis was overwhelmingly dominant in the reaction system. Our research findings show the amino-functionalized HPSNs can selectively promote the enzyme activity of β-galactosidase for transgalactosylation, which is beneficial for GOS production.",

The results are illustrated using a recombinant monoamine oxidase (expressed in Escherichia coli, used in resting state) for the oxidative desymmetrization of 3-azabicyclo[3,3,0]octane. It was shown that the need for washing biocatalyst prior to use in a reaction is dependent upon growth medium. Unlike cells grown in LB medium, washing of the cells was essential for cells grown on TB medium. With TB media, washing the cells improved the final conversion by approximately a factor of two. Additionally, over 50-fold improvement was achieved in initial activity. A potential reason for this improvement in activity was identified to be the increase in transfer of substrates across the cell membrane as a result of cell washing.",

The flexibility or rigidity of linkers between two fused partners is an important parameter that affects the function of fusion proteins. By combining the flexible unit GGGGS (F) and rigid unit EAAAK (R), ten linkers consisting of five elementary units that cover the fully rigid RRRRR linker to the fully flexible FFFFF linker were used to construct acid phosphatase-green fluorescence protein fusion protein (PhoC-GFP). By varying the linker flexibility in PhoC-GFPs, the relative specific activity of phosphotransferase and phosphatase varied from ∼19.0% to 100% and ∼9.35% to 100%, respectively. There exists an optimal linker capable of achieving the highest phosphotransferase/phosphatase activity and GFP fluorescence intensity. We found that the highest activities were achieved neither with the rigid RRRRR linker nor with the flexible FFFFF linker, but with the FFFRR linker. Linker flexibility could adjust the activity ratio between phosphotransferase and phosphatase and varied between ∼30% to 100%. PhoC-GFP with FRRRR linker achieved the highest relative specific phosphotransferase activity/relative specific phosphatase activity (T/P) value.

     "abstract": "There remains a need for rapid, specific and sensitive assays for the detection of bacterial indicators for water quality monitoring. In this study, a strategy for rapid detection of Escherichia coli in drinking water has been developed. This strategy is based on the use of the substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucuronide (MUG), which is hydrolyzed rapidly by the action of E. coli β-d-glucuronidase (GUD) enzyme to yield a fluorogenic 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) product that can be quantified and related to the number of E. coli cells present in water samples. In this study, the detection time required for the biosensor response ranged between 20 and 120 min, depending on the number of bacteria in the sample. This approach does not need extensive sample processing with a rapid detection capability. The specificity of the MUG substrate was examined in both, pure cultures of non-target bacterial genera such as Klebsiella, Salmonella, Enterobacter and Bacillus. Non-target substrates that included 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (MUGal) and l-leucine β-naphthylamide aminopeptidase (LLβ-N) were also investigated to identify nonspecific patterns of enzymatic activities in E. coli. GUD activity was found to be specific for E. coli and no further enzymatic activity was detected by other species. In addition, fluorescence assays were performed for the detection of E. coli to generate standard curves; and the sensitivity of the GUD enzymatic response was measured and repeatedly determined to be less than 10 E. coli cells in a reaction vial. The applicability of the method was tested by performing multiple fluorescence assays under pure and mixed bacterial flora in environmental samples. The results of this study showed that the fluorescence signals generated in samples using specific substrate molecules can be utilized to develop a bio-sensing platform for the detection of E. coli in drinking water. Furthermore, this system can be applied independently or in conjunction with other methods as a part of an array of biochemical assays in order to reliably detect E. coli in water.",

The three recombinant proteins, viz. C-hexahistidine fused HLipB, N and C-hexahistidine fused HLipBH and ZZ-fused ZZLipB were purified using affinity chromatography. All the three enzymes were mid to long fatty acyl chain selective on p-NP esters and S-enantioselective irrespective of tags. HLipB had lowest activation energy (3.5 Kcal mol−1) and highest catalytic efficiency (254 mM−1 min−1) on p-NP caprate followed by HLipBH and ZZLipB. However, ZZLipB demonstrated best pH stability (pH 6–10), thermostability (t1/2 of 50 min at 70 °C) and stability toward the denaturant Guanidium chloride (300 mM). Far-UV CD and fluorescence studies confirmed the role of N-terminal ZZ-tag in stabilizing the protein by altering its secondary and tertiary structures. All the three proteins were thiol activated. ZZLipB required higher concentration of β-mercaptoethanol as compared to the other two proteins to attain similar velocity. This indicated the involvement of additional disulfide bonds in its conformational stability. In silico analysis suggested low sequence identity of the enzyme with the available database but a close structural homology with Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) was revealed by PHYRE2. MULTALIN with CALB predicted the active site residues (Ser137–Asp228–His261) which were confirmed by superimposition and site directed mutagenesis.",

Moreover, due to their high metabolic activity, yeast cells have a potential to be applied as elements in the design of biofuel cells and biosensors.

In order to reduce this problem we have polymerized conducting polymer polypyrrole (Ppy) directly in the cell wall and/or within periplasmic membrane. In this research the formation of Ppy was induced by [Fe(CN)6]3−ions, which were generated from K4[Fe(CN)6], which was initially added to polymerization solution. The redox process was catalyzed by oxido-reductases, which are present in the plasma membrane of yeast cells. The formation of Ppy was confirmed by spectrophotometry and atomic force microscopy. It was confirmed that the conducting polymer polypyrrole was formed within periplasmic space and/or within the cell wall of yeast cells, which were incubated in solution containing pyrrole, glucose and [Fe(CN)6]4−. After 24 h drying at room temperature we have observed that Ppy-modified yeast cell walls retained their initial spherical form. In contrast to Ppy-modified cells, the walls of unmodified yeast have wrinkled after 24 h drying. The viability of yeast cells in the presence of different pyrrole concentrations has been evaluated.",

INVAAOX1 and INVBAOX1 displayed a 2- to 3-fold higher substrate affinity, and a 2- to 200-fold higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) than that observed for native INVA and INVB from Z. mobilis. Positive Schiff staining of INVAAOX1 and INVBAOX1 suggested a glycoprotein nature of both invertases. After deglycosylation of these enzymes, denoted D-INVAAOX1 and D-INVBAOX1, they exhibited a 1.3- and 3-fold lower catalytic efficiency (107 and 164 s−1 mM−1, respectively), and a 1.3- to 5-fold lower thermal stability than the glycosylated forms at temperatures of 35–45 °C. After deglycosylation no effect was observed in optimal pH, being of 5.5 for INVAAOX1, INVBAOX1, D-INVAAOX1 and D-INVBAOX1. The invertase activity of both enzymes increased in 80% (INVAAOX1) and 20% (INVBAOX1) in the presence of Mn2+ at 1 mM and 5 mM, respectively. INVAAOX1 and INVBAOX1 were highly active at sucrose concentrations of up to 400 and 300 mM, respectively; however, the tolerance to sucrose decreased to 300 mM for D-INVAAOX1.

To gain understanding of the role of PEPC in stress adaptation in plant, we cloned PEPC gene from Suaeda aralocaspica, a C4 species without Kranz anatomy, and performed a series of experiments with PEPC gene expressed in Escherichia coli under various abiotic stresses. Results showed that, based on the homology cloning and 5′-RACE technique, the full-length cDNA sequence of PEPC (2901 bp) from S. aralocaspica was obtained, which shares the typical conserved domains to documented PEPCs and was identified as PEPC-1 in accord to the reported partial sequence (ppc-1) in S. aralocaspica. qRT-PCR analysis revealed the expression patterns of PEPC-1 and PEPC-2 (known as ppc-2, another plant type of PEPC) in S. aralocaspica, suggesting that PEPC-1 was up-regulated during seed germination and under NaCl stress, and presented higher level in chlorenchyma than other tissues, which were significantly different with PEPC-2. Afterwards, PEPC-1 was recombinant in E. coli (pET-28a-PEPC) and expressed as an approximate 110 kDa protein. Under various abiotic stresses, the recombinant E. coli strain harboring with PEPC-1 showed significant advantage in growth at 400–800 mmol L−1 NaCl, 10–20% PEG6000, 25 and 30 °C lower temperature, 50–200 μmol L−1 methyl viologen, and pH 5.0 and 9.0 condition, compared to control. Further analysis of the enzymatic characteristics of the recombinant PEPC-1 suggests that it was the higher enzyme activity of PEPC-1 which might confer the stress tolerance to E. coli. We speculate that over expression of PEPC-1 is probably related to regulation of oxaloacetate (OAA) in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in E. coli, which may contribute to further understanding of the physiological function of PEPC in S. aralocaspica.",

The initial rates and the maximal degree of enzymatically catalyzed conversion of locust bean gum and guar gum galactomannans were determined. The hydrolysis product profile at maximal degree of conversion was determined using DNA sequencer-Assisted Saccharide analysis in High throughput (DASH). This is the first reported use of this method for analyzing galactomannooligosaccharides. AnMan26A and PaMan26A were found to have a novel substrate degradation pattern on the two galactomannan substrates. On the highly substituted guar gum AnMan26A and PaMan26A reached 35–40% as their maximal degree of conversion whereas the three tested GH5 endomannanases only reached 8–10% as their maximal degree of conversion. α-Galactosyl-mannose was identified as the dominant degradation product resulting from AnMan26A and PaMan26A action on guar gum, strongly indicating that these two enzymes can accommodate galactopyranosyl residues in the −1 and in the +1 subsite. The degradation of α-64-63-di-galactosyl-mannopentaose by AnMan26A revealed accommodation of galactopyranosyl residues in the −2, −1 and +1 subsite of the enzyme. Accommodation of galactopyranosyl residues in subsites −2 and +1 has not been observed for other characterized endomannanases to date. Docking analysis of galactomannooligosaccharides in available crystal structures and homology models supported the conclusions drawn from the experimental results.

All gene products were highly homologous to the reported bacterial hydrogenase-3 (Hyd-3) proteins. The genes hycE, hycF, hycG encoding the subunits of hydrogenase-3 were targeted for genetic knockout to inhibit the FHL hydrogen production pathway via the Red recombination system, generating three mutant strains AB91102-E (ΔhycE), AB91102-F (ΔhycF) and AB91102-G (ΔhycG). Deletion of the three genes affected the integrity of hydrogenase-3. The hydrogen production experiments with the mutant strains showed that no hydrogen was detected compared with the wild type (0.886 mol/mol glucose), demonstrating that knocking out any of the three genes could inhibit NADH hydrogen production pathway. Meanwhile, the metabolites of the mutant strains were significantly changed in comparison with the wild type, indicating corresponding changes in metabolic flux by mutation. Additionally, the activity of NADH-mediated hydrogenase was found to be nil in the mutant strains. The chemostat experiments showed that the NADH/NAD+ ratio of the mutant strains increased nearly 1.4-fold compared with the wild type. The NADH-mediated hydrogenase activity and NADH/NAD+ ratio analysis both suggested that NADH pathway required the involvement of the electron transport chain of hydrogenase-3.",

However, low activity and poor thermostability of l-asparaginase restrict its application in food industry. In this study, we successfully improved thermostability and catalytic efficiency of l-asparaginase II (BsAII) from Bacillus subtilis B11-06 by site-directed mutagenesis. According to sequences alignment and homologous modeling, residues G107, T109 and S166 which were adjacent to the catalytic cavity were selected and substituted by Asp, Gln/Ser and Ala, respectively, to construct mutants G107D, T109Q, T109S and S166A. The BsAII mutant of G107D (G107Dansz) displayed superior performance in thermal tolerance and higher activity than the wild-type enzyme (towards l-asparagine). Comparative analysis of hydrogen bond interactions, surface electrostatic potential and structure of substrate binding pocket between G107Danszand BsAII indicated that the substitution of G107, which was adjacent to catalytic cavity with Asp, resulted in small conformational changes and surface electrostatic potential redistribution and contributed to the improved protein stability and catalytic efficiency.",

     "abstract": "Bacillus amyloliquefaciens E1PA is a lipase-producing strain that was originally isolated from lipid-rich food waste, and the production of its lipase was found to be induced by vegetable oils. The E1PA lipase was successfully expressed and secreted in a heterologous Escherichia coli host and was ultimately purified. The conserved pentapeptide motif Ala-His-Ser-Met-Gly was observed at positions 108–112. The purified recombinant lipase was stable over a pH range of 4.0–11.0 at 40 °C and exhibited maximal activity at pH 10. The recombinant E1PA lipase hydrolyzed a wide range of acyl esters (C4–C18). However, the highest activity (3.5 units mg−1) was observed when the p-nitrophenyl ester of myristate (C14) was used as a substrate. Compared to the lipases produced by Bacillus spp., the E1PA lipase displayed a structural molecular mass excluding the leader sequence (19.22 kDa) and a pI (9.82) that were similar to those reported for B. amyloliquefaciens lipases and lipase subfamily I.4 but that were quite distinct from those of lipase subfamily I.5 (approximately 43 kDa, pI 6). These results suggested that Bacillus lipases are closely related. Although the recombinant E1PA lipase digested only certain oils, the wild-type E1PA lipase degraded a variety of oils, including blended and re-used cooking oils. The recombinant and wild-type forms of the E1PA lipase were able to digest heterogeneous lipid-rich food waste at similar levels; this result suggests that this lipase can function even when it solely consists of its structural enzyme component. The enzyme exhibited lipid hydrolysis ability as either an intracellular domain of the recombinant protein or an extracellular domain secreted by the E1PA strain. However, the recombinant lipase showed higher activity than the wild-type E1PA lipase, indicating that the recombinant protein from E. coli possessed effective lipase activity. Thus, the inducible alkaline E1PA lipase exhibited the ability to act on a broad spectrum of substrates, and the effective form produced in the heterogeneous host can be further developed for several applications, such as biodiesel production and lipase production.",

Mutagenesis of key residues in the active site of the enzyme may provide an effective strategy for enhancing stability and altering substrate specificity. In this study, multiple sequence alignment and structural analysis revealed that the acyl-binding residue, Gly414, of LIP1, which is located at a bend connecting α-helixes, was the non-conserved residue in five other isoenzymes. Using saturation mutagenesis, four mutants with improved stability (G414A, G414M, G414H and G414W) were obtained. Compared to the wild type, the best mutant (G414W) exhibited a remarkable 6.5-fold enhancement in half-life at 60 °C and a 14 °C higher T 50 15 . Its optimum temperature was increased by 15 °C. Simultaneously, G414W displayed a shift in substrate preference from medium-chain to short-chain pNP-ester. Modeling analysis showed that the multiple interactions formed by hydrophobic clusters and hydrogen bonds in the acyl-binding tunnel might lead to the observed thermostability improvement. Additionally, the bulky tryptophan substitution formed a strong steric hindrance to the accommodation of long-chain substrates in the tunnel. These results indicate that the key acyl-binding residues at the α-helix-connecting bend could mediate enzyme stability and catalytic substrate spectra.",

Sialylated GOS do not exist in natural milk, but can be produced from κ(kappa)-casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP), a sialylated side stream component from cheese-making, by sialidase-catalyzed transsialylation. Using a rationally designed mutant of the sialidase from Trypanosoma rangeli, Tr13, with enhanced transsialylation activity, six different GOS preparations with a varying degree of polymerization (DP) were effectively sialylated with molar yields of 20–30% on the CGMP sialyl in batch reactions. The rate of sialylation of the individual DPs was largely dependent on the DP distribution in each GOS preparation, and Tr13 catalysis did not discriminate against large GOS molecules, providing the novelty point that GOS molecules are sialylated independently of their size by Tr13. Using CGMP, GOS, and Tr13, the production of gram-scale quantities of sialyl-GOS was achieved in 20 L volume reactions. Compared to the benchmark transsialidase from pathogenic Trypanosoma cruzi, the Tr13 was significantly more thermostable. By employing an enzymatic membrane reactor, Tr13 could be recycled and after seven consecutive 1-h reaction cycles, the biocatalytic productivity of the enzyme was increased 7-fold compared to the batch reaction. Assuming that the enzyme may be specific for α-2,3-bound sialyl moieties only, and that only 50% of sialyl linkages in CGMP are α-2,3-linked, the molar yield of sialyl-GOS on the available α-2,3-bound sialyl moieties in CGMP reached 80% in the enzymatic membrane reactor system.",

Results demonstrated that 2,4-DCP hydroxylase exhibited a broad substrate specificity to CPs. The activities of 2,4-DCP hydroxylase against specific CP congeners, including 3-CP, 2,3,6-trichlorophenol, 2-CP, and 2,3-DCP, were higher than those against 2,4-DCP, which is the preferred substrate of previously reported 2,4-DCP hydroxylase. To verify whether cofactors are necessary to promote hydroxylase activity against CP congeners, we added FAD and found that the added FAD induced a 1.33-fold to 5.13-fold significant increase in hydroxylase activity against different CP congeners. The metabolic pathways of the CP degradation in the enzymatic hydroxylation step were preliminarily proposed on the basis of the analyses of the enzymatic activities against 19CP congeners. We found that the high activity and removal rate of 2,4-DCP hydroxylase against CPs at 0 °C enhance the low-temperature-adaptability of this enzyme to the CP congeners; as such, the proposed removal process may be applied to biochemical, bioremediation, and industrial processes, particularly in cold environments.",

     "abstract": "Spermidine is one of the several biogenic amines, produced during the microbial decarboxylation of proteins. Individual biogenic amines in the formed mixtures are frequently analyzed with oxygen sensor based biosensors, as their content serves as a good biomarker for the determination of food quality. In these biosensors, diamine oxidase from pea seedlings (PSAO), catalyzing the oxidation of various biogenic amines by dissolved oxygen is commonly used for the bio-recognition of amines. However, in the presence of spermidine and/or its metabolite 1,3-diaminopropane, the activity of PSAO and the sensitivity of PSAO-based biosensors decrease due to inhibition. The inhibition constant of soluble spermidine, acting as an inhibiting substrate toward PSAO, was found to be (40 ± 15) mM in freshly prepared solution and (0.28 ± 0.05) mM in solution, incubated 30 days at room temperature. The inhibition constant of 1,3-diaminopropane, acting as a competitive inhibitor, was (0.43 ± 0.12) mM as determined through the oxidation reaction of cadaverine. The metabolic half-life of soluble spermidine was 7 days at room temperature and 186 days at 4 °C. The kinetic measurements were carried out with an oxygen sensor; the composition of the solution of degraded spermidine was analyzed with MS.",

It exploits the tight binding of flavin cofactors to their target apo proteins. The method was tested for phenylacetone monooxygenase (PAMO) which is a well-studied and industrially interesting biocatalyst. Also a fusion protein was tested: PAMO fused to phosphite dehydrogenase (PTDH-PAMO). The employed flavin cofactor derivative, N6-(6-carboxyhexyl)-FAD succinimidylester (FAD*), was covalently anchored to agarose beads and served for apo enzyme immobilization by their reconstitution into holo enzymes. The thus immobilized enzymes retained their activity and remained active after several rounds of catalysis. For both tested enzymes, the generated agarose beads contained 3 U per g of dry resin. Notably, FAD-immobilized PAMO was found to be more thermostable (40% activity after 1 h at 60 °C) when compared to PAMO in solution (no activity detected after 1 h at 60 °C). The FAD-decorated agarose material could be easily recycled allowing multiple rounds of immobilization. This method allows an efficient and selective immobilization of flavoproteins via the FAD flavin cofactor onto a recyclable carrier.",

AROD was identified as a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent enzyme with 1 mol of FAD being contained in each subunit. It catalyzed the oxidative deamination of l-arginine and converted l-arginine to 2-ketoarginine, which was non-enzymatically converted into 4-guanidinobutyric acid when the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) formed by l-arginine oxidation was not removed. In contrast, 2-ketoarginine was present when H2O2was decomposed. AROD was specific to l-arginine with a Km value of 149 μM. It exhibited maximal activity at 55 °C and pH 5.5. AROD was stable in the pH range 5.5–7.5 and >95% of its original activity was below 60 °C at pH 7.0. Since these enzymatic properties are considered suitable for the determination of l-arginine, the gene was cloned and expressed in a heterologous expression system. We herein successfully developed a new simple enzymatic method for the determination of l-arginine using Pseudomonas AROD.",

It is not clear whether the reaction rate enhancements are purely due to thermal/heating effects or to non-thermal effects. Therefore, quantitative mass spectrometry was used to conduct accurate kinetic analysis of lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of triolein by microwave and conventional heating. Commercial lipases from Candida rugosa (CRL), Porcine Pancreas (PPL), and Burkholderia cepacia (BCL) were used. Hydrolysis reactions were performed at various temperatures and pH levels, along with various amounts of buffer and enzymes. Hydrolysis product yields at each time point using an internal-standard method showed no significant difference between microwave and conventional heating conditions when the reaction was carried out at the same temperature. CRL showed optimum catalytic activity at 37 °C, while PPL and BCL had better activities at 50 °C. The phosphate buffer was found to give a better hydrolysis yield than the Tris–HCl buffer. Overall results prove that a non-thermal effect does not exist in microwave-assisted lipase hydrolysis of triolein. Therefore, conventional heating at high temperatures (e.g., 50 °C) can be also used to accelerate hydrolysis reactions.",

However, fermentation processes used to produce organic acids and alcohols are often conducted in aqueous media. To produce esters in aqueous media, biphasic alginate beads with immobilized lipase are developed for in situ esterification of butanol and butyric acid. The biphasic beads contain a solid matrix of calcium alginate and hexadecane together with 5 mg/mL of lipase as the biocatalyst. Hexadecane in the biphasic beads serves as an organic phase to facilitate the esterification reaction. Under optimized conditions, the beads are able to catalyze the production of 0.16 mmol of butyl butyrate from 0.5 mmol of butyric acid and 1.5 mmol of butanol. In contrast, when monophasic beads (without hexadecane) are used, only trace amount of butyl butyrate is produced. One main application of biphasic beads is in simultaneous fermentation and esterification (SFE) because the organic phase inside the beads is very stable and does not leach out into the culture medium. SFE is successfully conducted with an esterification yield of 6.32% using biphasic beads containing iso-octane even though the solvent is proven toxic to the butanol-producing Clostridium spp.",

For detailed characterization of protein, the rv1497 gene was cloned, expressed with N-terminal His-tag and purified to homogeneity on Ni-NTA column. Rv1497 demonstrated both esterase and β-lactamase activities. A serine located within consensus β-lactamase motif ‘SXXK’ was identified as catalytic residue in both esterase and β-lactamase enzymatic activities whereas serine residue located within conserved pentapeptide did not show any effect on both enzyme activities. The catalytic residues of Rv1497 for β-lactamase activity were determined to be Ser88, Tyr-175 and His355 residues by site-directed mutagenesis. The enzyme demonstrated preference for short chain esters (pNP-butyrate).

For this purpose, copies of the glutamyl t-RNA reductase HemA from several bacteria were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis of which a HemA version from Salmonella typhimurium exhibited the highest ALA production. Cultivation of the HemA-expressing strain produced approximately 204 mg/L of ALA, while co-expression with HemL (glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase) increased ALA concentration to 457 mg/L, representing 11.6- and 25.9-fold increases over the control strain (17 mg/L of ALA). Further effects of metabolic perturbation were investigated, leading to penicillin addition that further improves ALA production to 584 mg/L. In an optimized flask fermentation, engineered C. glutamicum strains expressing the HemA and hemAL operon produced up to 1.1 and 2.2 g/L ALA, respectively, under glutamate-producing conditions. The final yields represent 10.7- and 22.0-fold increases over the control strain (0.1 g/L of ALA).

     "abstract": "In this study, we monitored the inhibition and deactivation effects of various compounds associated with lignocellulosic hydrolysates on individual and combinations of cellulases. Tannic acid representing polymeric lignin residues strongly inhibited cellobiohydrolase 1 (CBH1) and β-glucosidase 1 (BGL1), but had a moderate inhibitory effect on endoglucanase 2 (EG2). Individual monomeric lignin residues had little or no inhibitory effect on hydrolytic enzymes. However, coniferyl aldehyde and syringaldehyde substantially decreased the activity of CBH1 and deactivated BGL1. Acetic and formic acids also showed strong inhibition of BGL1 but not CBH1 and EG2, whereas tannic, acetic and formic acid strongly inhibited a combination of CBH1 and EG2 during Avicel hydrolysis. Diminishing enzymatic hydrolysis is largely a function of inhibitor concentration and the enzyme–inhibitor relationship, rather than contact time during the hydrolysis process (i.e. deactivation). This suggests that decreased rates of hydrolysis during the enzymatic depolymerisation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates may be imparted by other factors related to substrate crystallinity and accessibility.",

     "abstract": "Chiral amino alcohols are structural motifs present in sphingolipids, antibiotics, and antiviral glycosidase inhibitors. Their chemical synthesis presents several challenges in establishing at least two chiral centres. Here a de novo metabolic pathway using a transketolase enzyme coupled with a transaminase enzyme has been assembled. To synthesise this motif one of the strategies to obtain high conversions from the transaminase/transketolase cascade is the use of hydroxypyruvate (HPA) as a two-carbon donor for the transketolase reaction; although commercially available it is relatively expensive limiting application of the pathway on an industrial scale. Alternately, HPA can be synthesised but this introduces a further synthetic step. In this study two different biocatalytic strategies were developed for the synthesis of (2S,3R)-2-amino-1,3,4-butanetriol (ABT) without adding HPA into the reaction. Firstly, a sequential cascade of three enzymatic steps (two transaminases and one transketolase) for the synthesis of ABT from serine, pyruvate and glycolaldehyde as substrates. Secondly, a two-step recycling cascade where serine is used as donor to aminate erythrulose (catalysed by a transketolase) for the simultaneous synthesis of ABT and HPA. In order to test the novel pathways, three new transaminases are described, two ω-transaminases able to accept a broad range of amine acceptors with serine as amine donor; and an α-transaminase, which showed high affinity towards serine (KM: 18 mM) using pyruvate as amine acceptor. After implementation of the above enzymes in the biocatalytic pathways proposed in this paper, the two-step recycling pathway was found to be the most promising for its integration with E. coli metabolism. It was more efficient (10-fold higher conversion), more sustainable and cost-effective (use of low cost natural substrates and only two enzymes), and the reaction could be performed in a one-pot system.",

Although, human and plant CGLs have been extensively studied at the molecular and mechanistic levels, there has been little work on the molecular and catalytic properties of fungal CGL. Herein, we studied in detail for the first time the molecular and catalytic stability of Aspergillus fumigatus CGL, since conformational instability, inactivation and structural antigenicity are the main limitations of the PLP-dependent enzymes on various therapeutic uses. We examined these properties in response to buffer compositions, stabilizing and destabilizing agents using Differential Scanning Fluorometery (DSF), steady state and gel-based fluorescence of the intrinsic hydrophobic core, stability of internal aldimine linkage and catalytic properties. The activity of the recombinant A. fumigatus CGL was 13.8 U/mg. The melting temperature (Tm) of CGL in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0–8.0) was 73.3 °C, with ∼3 °C upshifting in MES and sodium phosphate buffers (pH 7.0). The conformational thermal stability was increased in potassium phosphate, sodium phosphate and MES buffers, in contrast to Tris–HCl, HEPES (pH 7.0) and CAPS (pH 9.0–10.0). The thermal stability and activity of CGL was slightly increased in the presence of trehalose and glycerol that might be due to hydration of the enzyme backbone, unlike the denaturing effect of GdmCl and urea. Modification of surface CGL glutamic and aspartic acids had no significant effect on the enzyme conformational and catalytic stability. Molecular modeling and dynamics simulations unveil the high conformational stability of the overall scaffold of CGL with high flexibility at the non-structural regions. CGL structure has eight buried Trp residues, which are reoriented to the enzyme surface and get exposed to the solvent under perturbation of destabilizers. Furthermore, electrostatic calculations of selected snapshots of CGL 3D structure under different experimental conditions showed a remarkable differences on the polarity of the enzyme surface.",

The rate of adsorbed enzyme onto lignin was reduced to a similar extent for the P1 and P2 mutants, whereas the adsorption of the P3 mutant was less affected compared with that of Tx-Xyn11.

Using E. coli HD701 for installing anaerobiosis showed a comparable hydrogen production yield and efficiency to the use of reducing agents and nitrogen sparging in case of hydrogen production from the E. coli HD701 non utilizable sugars. In contrast, using E. coli HD701 for installing anaerobiosis showed a lower hydrogen production yield and efficiency than the use of reducing agents and nitrogen sparging in case of using glucose as a substrate. This is possibly because E. coli HD701 when using glucose compensate for the substrate, and produce hydrogen with lower efficiency than C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824.

     "abstract": "Flavonoids are a large group of plant secondary metabolites that exert various biological and pharmacological effects. In this context, the generation of derivatives is of considerable interest. The introduction of hydroxy groups is of particular relevance, as they are known to be involved in many of the biological interactions and furthermore enable additional modifications, such as glycosylations. Bacterial aryl-hydroxylating dioxygenases (ARHDOs) have proven to be very useful for the conversion of aromatic structures into versatile building blocks for different kinds of derivatizations. Such enzymes have been used with varying success for the oxidation of flavonoids. In order to find better ARHDOs for the hydroxylation of such substrates, we carried out biotransformation trials with a collection of hybrid ARHDOs of different origin, using resting cells of recombinant strains. This identified enzymes able to transform all of the flavonoids examined, typically in yields above 50%. It also showed that moderately reactive substituents of flavonoids, such as hydroxy or amino groups, can lead to spontaneous follow-up reactions with the dienediol structures generated by dioxygenation. A report of flavanone epoxidation, a reaction never before observed to be catalyzed by an ARHDO, is challenged by our results. All ARHDOs examined converted this substrate into a dehydrogenase-transformable dihydrodiol. All dihydrodiols obtained by dioxygenation of the examined flavonoids were successfully re-aromatized into catechols by a bacterial dehydrogenase. These metabolites were usually stable. However, the catechols formed from flavanone and 2’-hydroxy-chalcone, respectively, were interconvertible under mild conditions.

In Clostridium ljungdahlii DSM 13528, the gene CLJU_c23220 encoding the putative Zn2+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme, CLAR, can catalyze the conversion of acetoin to 2,3-butanediol with NADPH as the cofactor. Furthermore, the gene CLJU_c23220 was introduced into Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and the transformant was conferred the capacity of 2,3-butanediol production. In batch fermentation the transformant produced up to 3.1 g/L of 2,3-butanediol, as well as acetone, butanol and ethanol (ABE, 17.8 g/L) in amounts similar to those produced by the wild type strain. This study provides conclusive evidence at the protein level that CLJU_c23220 is the key gene responsible for the conversion of acetoin to 2,3-butanediol in C. ljungdahlii DSM 13528.

The spinning dope was an emulsion consisting of an aqueous phase with the solubilized enzyme in a pH buffer plus an oil phase of the polymer solubilized in chloroform (CF)/dimethylformamide (DMF). The optimized materials were composed by random arrays of bead-free fibers with outer diameters in the range 110–180 nm without showing core–shell structure. The fiber size and morphology, membrane porosity and surface properties were shown to be influenced by the polymer concentration and the composition ratio of the solvent mixture, and also by the presence of the enzyme. The activity of the immobilized trypsin was studied toward both a low-molecular weight synthetic substrate (BAPNA) and a protein (casein). Fluorescence microscopy, the increasing hydrophilicity of the fibrous membrane and the observed catalytic activity confirmed the entrapment of the enzyme into the PCL nanofibers. The best activity retention (∼66% toward BAPNA) was achieved using 0.20 g/mL PCL in CF/DMF [75:25], with trypsin in an aqueous buffer at pH 7.1 in the presence of benzamidine and Span80. The immobilized enzyme showed satisfactory operational stability retaining ∼59% of its initial activity after five reaction cycles. Compared with the free enzyme, the storage (at 4 °C) and thermal stability of the immobilized enzyme were highly improved. The retained catalytic activity and the observed reusability can be explained by a heterogeneous distribution of the enzyme within the polymer fiber influenced by the electrostatic field during the electrospinning process, enabling a preferential location near the fiber surface but simultaneously assuring minimal leaching out during operations. Results suggest that trypsin-PCL fibrous membranes may be useful for concomitant proteolytic and separation commercial applications.",

We found that enzymes could be spontaneously encapsulated in the interior cavity of the CMs via hydrophobic interactions. Due to strong hydrophobic interactions and robust confinement, leaching of the physically adsorbed enzymes is substantially restricted. As a novel immobilization matrix, the CMs display many significant advantages. They are capable of encapsulating a wide range of proteins/enzymes of different sizes, which can then be used in both aqueous and organic media and retain high activity, stability, and excellent reusability. Moreover, CMs could be considered as efficient microreactors that provide a favorable microaqueous environment for enzymes in organic systems. Therefore, this doubly effective and simple immobilization approach can be easily expanded to many other enzymes and has great potential in a variety of enzyme applications.",

Specifically, CtCBM3 from Clostridium thermocellum was fused to the carboxyl terminus of the acetyl xylan esterase (AnAXE) from Aspergillus nidulans, and active forms of both AnAXE and AnAXE–CtCBM3 were produced in Pichia pastoris. CtCBM3 fusion had negligible impact on the thermostability or regioselectivity of AnAXE; activities towards acetylated corncob xylan, 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate, p-nitrophenyl acetate, and cellobiose octaacetate were also unchanged. By contrast, the activity of AnAXE–CtCBM3 on cellulose acetate increased by two to four times over 24 h, with greater differences observed at earlier time points. Binding studies using microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) and a commercial source of cellulose acetate confirmed functional production of the CtCBM3 domain; affinity gel electrophoresis using acetylated xylan also verified the selectivity of CtCBM3 binding to cellulose. Notably, gains in enzyme activity on cellulose acetate appeared to exceed gains in substrate binding, suggesting that fusion to CtCBM3 increases functional associations between the enzyme and insoluble, high molecular weight cellulosic substrates.",

Recent work has shown how important the role that the so-called accessory enzymes can play in an effective enzymatic hydrolysis. In this study, three newest Novozymes Cellic CTec cellulase preparations (CTec 1/2/3) were compared to hydrolyze steam pretreated lignocellulosic substrates and model substances at an identical FPA loading. These cellulase preparations were found to display significantly different hydrolytic performances irrelevant with the FPA. And this difference was even observed on the filter paper itself when the FPA based assay was revisited. The analysis of specific enzyme activity in cellulase preparations demonstrated that different accessory enzymes were mainly responsible for the discrepancy of enzymatic hydrolysis between diversified substrates and various cellulases. Such the active role of accessory enzymes present in cellulase preparations was finally verified by supplementation with β-glucosidase, xylanase and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases AA9. This paper provides new insights into the role of accessory enzymes, which can further provide a useful reference for the rational customization of cellulase cocktails in order to realize an efficient conversion of natural lignocellulosic substrates.",

Recently, it was shown that caveolae-like structures were formed in Escherichia coli through the expression of caveolin-1. This interesting structure seems to be versatile for a variety of biotechnological applications. Targeting of heterologous proteins in the caveolae-like structure should be the first question to be addressed for this purpose. Here we show that membrane proteins co-expressed with caveolin-1 are embedded into the heterologous caveolae (h-caveolae), the cavaolae-like structures formed inside the cell. Two transmembrane SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins, Syntaxin 1a and vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2), were displayed on the h-caveolae surface. The size of the h-caveolae harboring the transmembrane proteins was ∼100 nm in diameter. The proteins were functional and faced outward on the h-caveolae. Multi-spanning transmembrane proteins FtsH and FeoB could be included in the h-caveolae, too. Furthermore, the recombinant E. coli cells were shown to endocytose substrate supplemented in the medium. These results provide a basis for exploiting the h-caveolae formed inside E. coli cells for future biotechnological applications.",

The distribution of enzymes – cellobiohydrolase I (Cel7A), endoglucanase I (Cel7B) and β-glucosidase – of the two formulations between the residual substrate and supernatant during the course of enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation was investigated. The potential of recyclability using alkaline wash was also studied. The efficiency of hydrolysis with an enzyme load of 10 FPU/g cellulose reached >98% using Cellic® CTec2, while for Celluclast a conversion of 52% and 81%, was observed without and with β-glucosidase supplementation, respectively. The decrease of Cellic® CTec2 activity observed along the process was related to deactivation of Cel7A rather than of Cel7B and β-glucosidase. The adsorption/desorption profiles during hydrolysis/fermentation revealed that a large fraction of active enzymes remained adsorbed to the solid residue throughout the process. Surprisingly, this was the case of Cel7A and β-glucosidase from Cellic, which remained adsorbed to the solid fraction along the entire process.Alkaline washing was used to recover the enzymes from the solid residue. This method allowed efficient recovery of Celluclast enzymes; however, this may be achieved only when minor amounts of cellulose remain present. Regarding the Cellic formulation, neither the presence of cellulose nor lignin restricted an efficient desorption of the enzymes at alkaline pH. This work shows that the recycling strategy must be customized for each particular formulation, since the enzymes found e.g. in Cellic and Celluclast bear quite different behaviour regarding the solid–liquid distribution, stability and cellulose and lignin affinity.",

The astaxanthin productivity could reach 11.26 mg L−1 d−1 at 3% (v/v) ethanol, which was 2.03 times of that of the control. The transcriptional expression patterns of eight carotenogenic genes were evaluated using real-time PCR. The results showed that ethanol greatly enhanced transcription of the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) isomerase genes (ipi-1 and ipi-2), which were responsible for isomerization reaction of IPP and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). This finding suggests that ethanol induced astaxanthin biosynthesis was up-regulated mainly by ipi-1 and ipi-2 at transcriptional level, promoting isoprenoid synthesis and substrate supply to carotenoid formation.

Interestingly, all mutant enzymes showed significantly altered kinetic parameters, specifically reduced affinity towards both the substrate and cofactor. Importantly, mutation of R318 led to a complete loss of AHAS activity, indicating a key role for this residue in substrate binding. Furthermore, all mutants demonstrated significant herbicide resistance against chlorimuron ethyl (CE), with several-fold higher IC50 than that of wild type AHAS. Docking analysis also indicated that binding of CE was slightly affected upon mutation of these residues.

     "abstract": "Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose is often conducted in batch processes in which hydrolytic products tend to inhibit enzyme activity. In this study, we report a method for continuous hydrolysis of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) by using cross-linked cellulase aggregate (XCA) trapped inside a membrane. XCA particles prepared by using a millifluidic reactor have a uniform size distribution around 350 nm. Because of their large size, XCA particles in solutions can be filtered through a polyethersulfone membrane to collect 87.1 ± 0.9% of XCA particles. The membrane with impregnated XCA can be used as a catalyst for hydrolysis of CMC in a continuous mode. When the CMC concentration is 1.0 g/l and the flow rate is 2 μl/min, 53.9% of CMC is hydrolyzed to reducing sugars. The membrane with XCA is very stable under continuously flowing solutions. After 72 h of reaction, 97.5% of XCA remains inside the membrane.",

     "abstract": "Biopolymer pectin stabilized gold nanoparticles were prepared at graphene and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (GR-MWNTs/AuNPs) and employed for the determination of glucose. The formation of GR-MWNTs/AuNPs was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, UV–vis and FTIR spectroscopy methods. Glucose oxidase (GOx) was successfully immobilized on GR-MWNTs/AuNPs film and direct electron transfer of GOx was investigated. GOx exhibits highly enhanced redox peaks with formal potential of −0.40 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The amount of electroactive GOx and electron transfer rate constant were found to be 10.5 × 10−10 mol cm−2 and 3.36 s−1, respectively, which were significantly larger than the previous reports. The fabricated amperometric glucose biosensor sensitively detects glucose and showed two linear ranges: (1) 10 μM – 2 mM with LOD of 4.1 μM, (2) 2 mM – 5.2 mM with LOD of 0.95 mM. The comparison of the biosensor performance with reported sensors reveals the significant improvement in overall sensor performance. Moreover, the biosensor exhibited appreciable stability, repeatability, reproducibility and practicality. The other advantages of the fabricated biosensor are simple and green fabrication approach, roughed and stable electrode surface, fast in sensing and highly reproducible.",

     "abstract": "Several bacterial sialyltransferases have been reported to be multifunctional also catalysing sialidase and trans-sialidase reactions. In this study, we examined the trans-sialylation efficacy and regioselectivity of mutants of the multifunctional Pasteurella multocida sialyltransferase (PmST) for catalysing the synthesis of 3′- and 6′-sialyllactose using casein glycomacropeptide as sialyl-donor and lactose as acceptor. The mutation P34H led to a 980-fold increase in α-2,6-sialyltransferase activity (with cytidine-5′-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid as donor), while its α-2,3-sialyltransferase activity was abolished. Histidine in this position is conserved in α-2,6-sialyltransferases and has been suggested, and recently confirmed, to be the determinant for strict regiospecificity in the sialyltransferase reaction. Our data verified this theorem. In trans-sialidase reactions, the P34H mutant displayed a distinct preference for 6′-sialyllactose synthesis but low levels of 3′-sialyllactose were also produced. The sialyllactose yield was however lower than when using PmSTWT under optimal conditions for 6′-sialyllactose formation. The discrepancy in regiospecificity between the two reactions could indicate subtle differences in the substrate binding site in the two reactions. In contrast, the two mutations E271F and R313Y led to preferential synthesis of 3′-sialyllactose over 6′-sialyllactose and the double mutant (PmSTE271F/R313Y) exhibited the highest α-2,3-regioselectivity via reduced sialidase and α-2,6-trans-sialidase activity. The double mutant PmSTE271F/R313Y thus showed the highest α-2,3-regioselectivity and constitutes an interesting enzyme for regioselective synthesis of α-2,3-sialylated glycans. This study has expanded the understanding of the structure-function relationship of multifunctional, bacterial sialyltransferases and provided new enzymes for regioselective glycan sialylation.",

     "abstract": "The biotransformation of lignocellulose biomasses into fermentable sugars is a very complex procedure including, as one of the most critical steps, the (hemi) cellulose hydrolysis by specific enzymatic cocktails. We explored here, the potential of stable glycoside hydrolases from thermophilic organisms, so far not used in commercial enzymatic preparations, for the conversion of glucuronoxylan, the major hemicellulose of several energy crops. Searches in the genomes of thermophilic bacteria led to the identification, efficient production, and detailed characterization of novel xylanase and α-glucuronidase from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius (GH10-XA and GH67-GA, respectively) and a α-glucuronidase from Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus (GH67-GC). Remarkably, GH10-XA, if compared to other thermophilic xylanases from this family, coupled good specificity on beechwood xylan and the best stability at 65 °C (3.5 days). In addition, GH67-GC was the most stable α-glucuronidases from this family and the first able to hydrolyse both aldouronic acid and aryl-α-glucuronic acid substrates. These enzymes, led to the very efficient hydrolysis of beechwood xylan by using 7- to 9-fold less protein (concentrations <0.3 μM) and in much less reaction time (2 h vs 12 h) if compared to other known biotransformations catalyzed by thermophilic enzymes. In addition, remarkably, together with a thermophilic β-xylosidase, they catalyzed the production of xylose from the smart cooking pre-treated biomass of one of the most promising energy crops for second generation biorefineries. We demonstrated that search by the CAZy Data Bank of currently available genomes and detailed enzymatic characterization of recombinant enzymes allow the identification of glycoside hydrolases with novel and interesting properties and applications.",

Four data driven rational design methods (B-FITTER, proline theory, PoPMuSiC-2.1, and sequence consensus approach) were adopted to identify the key residue potential links with thermostability, and 39 residues of Bacillus acidopullulyticus pullulanase were chosen as mutagenesis targets. Single mutagenesis followed by combined mutagenesis resulted in the best mutant E518I-S662R-Q706P, which exhibited an 11-fold half-life improvement at 60 °C and a 9.5 °C increase in Tm. The optimum temperature of the mutant increased from 60 to 65 °C. Fluorescence spectroscopy results demonstrated that the tertiary structure of the mutant enzyme was more compact than that of the wild-type (WT) enzyme. Structural change analysis revealed that the increase in thermostability was most probably caused by a combination of lower stability free-energy and higher hydrophobicity of E518I, more hydrogen bonds of S662R, and higher rigidity of Q706P compared with the WT. The findings demonstrated the effectiveness of combined data-driven rational design approaches in engineering an industrial enzyme to improve thermostability.",

Then, as a reaction end point, very different nucleophiles have been used to block the support and the effect of the nature of the blocking reagent has been analyzed on the features of the immobilized preparations. The blocking has generally positive effects on enzyme stability in both thermal and organic solvent inactivations. For example, CALB improved 7.5-fold the thermal stability after blocking with imidazole. The effect on enzyme activity was more variable, strongly depending on the substrate and the experimental conditions. Referring to CALB; using p-nitrophenyl butyrate (p-NPB) and methyl phenylacetate, activity always improved by the blocking step, whatever the blocking reagent, while with methyl mandelate or ethyl hexanoate not always the blocking presented a positive effect. Other example is TLL-DVS biocatalyst blocked with Cys. This was more than 8 times more active than the non-blocked preparation and become the most active versus p-NPB at pH 7, the least active versus methyl phenylacetate at pH 5 but the third one most active at pH 9, versus methyl mandelate presented lower activity than the unblocked preparation at pH 5 and versus ethyl hexanoate was the most active at all pH values.

     "abstract": "Screening of microorganisms capable of producing alginate lyase enzyme is commonly carried out by investigating their abilities to grow on alginate-containing solid media plates and occurrence of a clearance zone after flooding the plates with agents such as 10% (w/v) cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC), which can form complexes with alginate. Although the CPC method is good, advantageous, and routinely used, the agar in the media interferes with the action of CPC, which makes judgment about clearance zones very difficult. In addition, this method takes a minimum of 30 min to obtain the zone of hydrolysis after flooding and the hydrolyzed area is not sharply discernible. An improved plate assay is reported herein for the detection of extracellular alginate lyase production by microorganisms. In this method, alginate-containing agar plates are flooded with Gram's iodine instead of CPC. Gram's iodine forms a bluish black complex with alginate but not with hydrolyzed alginate, giving sharp, distinct zones around the alginate lyase producing microbial colonies within 2–3 min. Gram's iodine method was found to be more effective than the CPC method in terms of visualization and measurement of zone size. The alginate-lyase-activity area indicated using the Gram's iodine method was found to be larger than that indicated by the CPC method. Both methods (CPC and Gram's iodine) showed the largest alginate lyase activity area for Saccharophagus degradans (ATCC 43961) followed by Microbulbifer mangrovi (KCTC 23483), Bacillus cereus (KF801505) and Paracoccus sp. LL1 (KP288668) grown on minimal sea salt medium. The rate of growth and metabolite production in alginate-containing minimal sea salt liquid medium, followed trends similar to that of the zone activity areas for the four bacteria under study. These results suggested that the assay developed in this study of Gram's iodine could be useful to predict the potential of microorganisms to produce alginate lyase. The method also worked well for screening and identification of alginate lyase producers and non-producers from environmental samples on common laboratory media. They did this by clearly showing the presence or absence of clearance zones around the microbial colonies grown. This new method is rapid, efficient, and could easily be performed for screening a large number of microbial cultures. This is the first report on the use of Gram's iodine for the detection of alginate lyase production by microorganisms using plate assay.",

Sequence alignment with other β-glycosidases from hyperthermophilic archaea showed two unique active site residues, Gln77 and Asp206. These residues were represented by Arg and Asp in all other hyperthermophilic β-glycosidases. The two active site residues were mutated to Q77R, D206N and D206Q, to study the role of these unique active site residues in catalytic activity and to alter the substrate specificity to enhance its β-glucosidase activity. The secondary structure analysis of all the mutants showed no change in their structure and exhibited in similar conformation like wild-type as they all existed in dimer form in an SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. Q77R and D206Q affected the catalytic activity of the enzyme whereas the D206N altered the catalytic turn-over rate for glucosidase and mannosidase activities with fucosidase activity remain unchanged. Gln77 is reported to interact with catalytic nucleophile and Asp206 with axial C2-hydroxyl group of substrates. Q77R might have made some changes in three dimensional structure due to its electrostatic effect and lost its catalytic activity. The extended side chains of D206Q is predicted to affect the substrate binding during catalysis. The high-catalytic turn-over rate by D206N for β-glucosidase activity makes it a useful enzyme in cellulose degradation at high temperatures.",

The role of PDI in cellulase production is speculative, as well as the possibility of PDI as a target for improving enzyme production efficiency of Trichoderma reesei, a widely used producer of enzyme for the production of lignocellulose-based biofuels and biochemicals. Here, we report that a PDI homolog, TrPDI2 in T. reesei exhibited a 36.94% and an 11.81% similarity to Aspergillus niger TIGA and T. reesei PDI1, respectively. The capability of TrPDI2 to recover the activity of reduced and denatured RNase by promoting refolding verified its protein disulfide isomerase activity. The overexpression of Trpdi2 increased the secretion and the activity of CBH1 at the early stage of cellulase induction. In addition, both the expression level and redox state of TrPDI2 responded to cellulase induction in T. reesei, providing sustainable oxidative power to ensure cellobiohydrolase maturation and production. The results suggest that TrPDI2 may contribute to cellobiohydrolase secretion by enhancing the capability of disulfide bond formation, which is essential for protein folding and maturation.",

We determined the crystal structure of CrtD from Nonlabens dokdonensis DSW-6 (NdCrtD), the first structure of CrtD family enzymes. The NdCrtD structure was composed of two distinct domains, an FAD-binding domain and a substrate-binding domain, and the substrate-binding domain can be divided into two subdomains, a Rossmann fold-like subdomain and a lid subdomain. Although the FAD-binding domain showed a structure similar to canonical FAD-containing enzymes, the substrate-binding domain exhibited a novel structure to constitute a long and hydrophobic tunnel with a length of ∼40 Å. The molecular docking-simulation reveals that the tunnel provides an appropriate substrate-binding site for the carotenoid such as 1′-OH-γ-carotene with a length of ∼35 Å.

EndoBI-1-released N-glycans were quantified by a phenol-sulphuric total carbohydrate assay and the resultant N-glycan structures monitored by nano-LC-Chip-Q–TOF MS. The kinetic parameters and structural characterization of glycans released suggest EndoBI-1 can facilitate large-scale release of complex, bioactive glycans from a variety of glycoprotein substrates.

     "abstract": "d-glucosamine was conjugated to bovine trypsin by carbodiimide chemistry, involving a water-soluble carbodiimide and a succinimide ester, with the latter being to increase the yield of the conjugation. Mass spectrometric data suggested that several glycoforms were formed, with around 12 d-glucosamine moieties coupled to each trypsin molecule on average. The moieties were probably coupled to eight carboxyl groups (of glutamyl and aspartyl residues) and to four tyrosyl residues on the surface of the enzyme. The glycated trypsin possessed increased thermal stability. When compared with its unmodified counterpart, T50% was increased by 7 °C, thermal inactivation of the first step was increased 34%, and long-term stability assay revealed 71-times higher residual activity at 25 °C (without stabilizing Ca2+ ions in aqueous buffer) after 67 days. Furthermore, resistance against autolysis was increased almost two-fold. Altered functional properties of the glycated trypsin were also observed. The glycated trypsin was found to become increasingly basophilic, and was found to be slightly structurally altered. This was indicated by 1.2 times higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) than unmodified trypsin against the substrate N-α-benzoyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide. Circular dichroism spectropolarimetry suggested a minor change in spatial arrangement of α-helix/helices, resulting in an increased affinity of the glycated trypsin for this small synthetic substrate.",

Varying the reaction pH from 6.0 to 7.5 and the initial concentration of the ester substrate from 25 to 100 mM, the highest yield of oligo-tyrosine peptides (79% on a substrate basis) was produced at pH 6.5 and 75 mM, respectively. In the reaction initiated with 100 mM of the substrate, approx. 50% yield of insoluble, highly polymerized peptides accumulated. At less than 15 mM, the reaction proceeded poorly; however, from 30 mM to 120 mM a dose-dependent increase in the consumption rate of the substrate was observed with a sigmoidal curve. Meanwhile, each of the tri- and tetra-tyrosine peptides, even at approx. 5 mM, was consumed effectively by papain but was not elongated to insoluble polymers. For deacylation of the acyl-papain intermediate through which a new peptide bond is made, l-tyrosine ethyl ester, even at 5 mM, showed higher nucleophilic activity than di- and tri-tyrosine. These results indicate that the mechanism through which papain polymerizes l-tyrosine ethyl ester is as follows: the first interaction between papain and the ester substrate is a rate-limiting step; oligo-tyrosine peptides produced early in the reaction period are preferentially used as acyl donors, while the initial ester substrate strongly contributes as a nucleophile to the elongation of the peptide product; and the balance between hydrolytic fragmentation and further elongation of oligo-tyrosine peptides is dependent on the surrounding concentration of the ester substrate.",

In this study, for the first time, we used iron ions (Fe2+) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme together to synthesize flowerlike hybrid nanostructures with greatly enhanced activity and stability and reported an explanation of the enhancements in both catalytic activity and stability. We demonstrated that Fe2+-HRP hybrid nanoflower (HNF) showed catalytic activity of ∼512% and ∼710%, respectively when stored at +4 °C and room temperature (RT = 20 °C) compared to free HRP. In addition, the HNF stored at +4 °C lost only 2.9% of its original activity within 30 days while the HNF stored at RT lost approximately 10% of its original activity. However, under the same conditions, free HRP enzymes stored at +4 °C and RT lost 68% and 91% of their activities, respectively. We claim that the drastic increases in activities of HNF are associated with to high local HRP concentration in nanoscale dimension, appropriate HRP conformation, less mass transfer limitations, and role of Fe2+ ion as an activator for HRP. Further biosensors studies based on enhanced activity and stability of HNF are currently underway.",

IpGlc significantly improved the Pp-CALB catalyzing esterification efficiency when using long chain fatty acids as the acyl donor. Under the preferred operating conditions (50 °C, 40 g/L molecular sieve dosage and 200 rpm mixing intensity), 60.5% of IpGlc converted to 6-O-myristate-1, 2-O-isopropylidene-α-d-glucofuranose (C14-IpGlc) after a 96-h reaction in a 2-L stirred reactor. In a 5-L pilot scale test, Pp-CALB also showed a similar substrate conversion rate of 55.4% and excellent operational stability.

However, only about 5% of the lactose was converted into lacto-N-tetraose by this approach. The major product obtained was the intermediate lacto-N-triose II (GlcNAc(β1-3)Gal(β1-4)Glc).In order to improve the bioconversion of lactose to lacto-N-tetraose, we have investigated the influence of the carbon source on the formation of lacto-N-tetraose and on the intracellular availability of the glycosyltransferase substrates, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-galactose. By growth of the recombinant E. coli cells on D-galactose, the yield of lacto-N-tetraose (810.8 mg L−1 culture) was 3.6-times higher compared to cultivation on D-glucose.Using fed-batch cultivation with galactose as sole energy and carbon source, a large-scale synthesis of lacto-N-tetraose was demonstrated.

     "abstract": "Various isoforms of invertases from prokaryotes, fungi, and higher plants has been expressed in Escherichia coli, and codon optimisation is a widely-adopted strategy for improvement of heterologous enzyme expression. Successful synthetic gene design for recombinant protein expression can be done by matching its translational elongation rate against heterologous host organisms via codon optimization. Amongst the various design parameters considered for the gene synthesis, codon context bias has been relatively overlooked compared to individual codon usage which is commonly adopted in most of codon optimization tools. In addition, matching the rates of transcription and translation based on secondary structure may lead to enhanced protein folding. In this study, we evaluated codon context fitness as design criterion for improving the expression of thermostable invertase from Thermotoga maritima in Escherichia coli and explored the relevance of secondary structure regions for folding and expression. We designed three coding sequences by using (1) a commercial vendor optimized gene algorithm, (2) codon context for the whole gene, and (3) codon context based on the secondary structure regions. Then, the codon optimized sequences were transformed and expressed in E. coli. From the resultant enzyme activities and protein yield data, codon context fitness proved to have the highest activity as compared to the wild-type control and other criteria while secondary structure-based strategy is comparable to the control. Codon context bias was shown to be a relevant parameter for enhancing enzyme production in Escherichia coli by codon optimization. Thus, we can effectively design synthetic genes within heterologous host organisms using this criterion.",

To develop a system based on hemoglobin to help bacteria cells overcome the oxygen shortage in fermentation, in this study, Campylobacter jejuni truncated hemoglobin (CtrHb) gene was synthesized and expressed under the control of constitutive expression promoters P2 and PSPO1-II in Escherichia coli. As showed by the growth curves of the two recombinants P2-CtrHb and PSPO1-II-CtrHb, constitutive expression of CtrHb improved cell growth under aerobic shaking-flasks, anaerobic capped-bottles and bioreactor conditions. According to the NMR analysis, this improvement might come from the expression of hemoglobin which could boost the metabolism of cells by supplying more oxygen to the respiratory chain processes. Through semi-quantitative RT-PCR and CO differential spectrum assays, we further discussed the connection between the growth patterns of the recombinants, the expression level of CtrHb and oxygen binding capacity of CtrHb in cells.

By harnessing the directed evolution process in S. cerevisiae, the beneficial mutations for secretion enabled Pichia pastoris to express the evolved UPO under the control of the methanol inducible alcohol oxidase 1 promoter. Whilst secretion levels were found similar for both yeasts in flask fermentation (∼8 mg/L), the recombinant UPO from P. pastoris showed a 27-fold enhanced production in fed-batch fermentation (217 mg/L).

The classic method used to synthesize them is chemical nitration, which involves the use of nitric acid diluted in water or acetic acid, both harmful to the environment. With the development of green chemistry, environmental friendly enzyme catalysis is increasingly employed in chemical processes. In this work, we adopted a non-aqueous horseradish peroxidase (HRP)/NaNO2/H2O2 reaction system to study the structural characteristics of aromatic compounds potentially nitrated by enzyme catalysis, as well as the relationship between the charges on carbon atoms in benzene ring and the nitro product distribution. Investigation of various reaction parameters showed that mild reaction conditions (ambient temperature and neutral pH), plus appropriate use of H2O2 and NaNO2 could prevent inactivation of HRP and polymerization of the substrates. Compared to aqueous–organic co-solvent reaction media, the aqueous–organic two-liquid phase system had great advantages in increasing the dissolved concentration of substrate and alleviating substrate inhibition. Analysis of the aromatic compounds’ structural characteristics indicated that substrates containing substituents of NH2 or OH were readily catalyzed. Furthermore, analysis of the relationship between natural bond orbital (NBO) charges on carbon atoms in benzene ring, as calculated by the density functional method, and the nitro product distribution characteristics, demonstrated that the favored nitration sites were the ortho and para positions of substituents in benzene ring, similar to the selectivity of chemical nitration.",

     "abstract": "Demethylation of industrial lignin has been for long coveted as a pathway to the production of an abundant natural substitute for fossil-oil derived phenol. In an attempt to possibly identify a novel Kraft lignin-demethylating enzyme, we surveyed a collection of fungi by using selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS). This method readily identifies methanol resulting from lignin demethylation activity. Absidia cylindrospora, and unidentified Cylindrocladium sp. and Aspergillus sp. were shown to metabolize lignin via different pathways, based on the HPLC analysis of lignin fragments. Of these three, Cylindrocladium and Aspergillus were shown to retain most of the lignin intact after 3 weeks in culture, while removing about 40% of the available methoxy groups. Our results demonstrate that after optimization of culture and lignin recovery methods, biological modification of Kraft lignin may be a feasible pathway to obtaining demethylated lignin for further industrial use.",

     "abstract": "Phage lytic enzymes are promising antimicrobial agents. Lysins of phages phi11 (LysPhi11) and phi80α (LysPhi80α) can lyse (destroy) cells of antibiotic-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Stability of enzymes is one of the parameters making their practical use possible. The objectives of the study were to investigate the stability of lysins of phages phi11 and phi80α in storage and functioning conditions, to identify optimum storage conditions and causes of inactivation. Stability of the recombinant LysPhi11 and LysPhi80α was studied using turbidimetry. CD-spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and electrophoresis were used to identify causes of inactivation. At 37 °C, pH 7.5 and concentration of NaCl not higher than 150 mM, LysPhi11 molecules contain a high percentage of random coils (43%). However, in spite of this the enzyme has high activity (0.4–0.8 OD600 nm s−1 mg−1). In storage conditions (4 °C and 22 °C, pH 6.0–9.0, 10–500 mM NaCl) LysPhi11 is inactivated by a monomolecular mechanism. The optimum storage conditions for LysPhi11 (4 °C, pH 6.0–7.5, 10 mM NaCl) were selected under which the time of the enzyme half-inactivation is 120–160 days. LysPhi80α stability is insufficient: at 37 °C the enzyme loses half of its activity almost immediately; at 4 °C and 22 °C the time of half-inactivation of LysPhi80α varies in the range from several hours to 3 days. Despite the common properties in the manifestation of antistaphylococcal activity the kinetic behavior of the enzymes is different. LysPhi11 is a more promising candidate to be used as an antimicrobial agent.",

     "abstract": "Beta-lactam antibiotics comprise the largest group of antibacterial agents. Due to their bactericidal properties and limited toxicity to humans they are preferred in antimicrobial therapy. In most cases, therapy is empiric since susceptibility testing in diagnostic laboratories takes a relatively long time. This paper presents a novel platform that is based on the microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology and focuses on the early antibiogram determination of isolates against a series of beta-lactam antibiotics. An advantage of the system is that it can be integrated into traditional microbiological diagnostic laboratory procedures. Tested bacterium suspensions are uploaded into the anodic chambers of each miniaturized MFC unit integrated into a panel system, containing different antibiotic solutions. Electronic signals gained in each MFC unit are continuously monitored and are proportional to the metabolic activity of the presenting test bacterium. Using this method, antibiotic susceptibility can be evaluated in 2–4 h after inoculation. Hereby we demonstrate the efficacy of the platform in antibiogram determination by testing the susceptibilities of Escherichia coli strain ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus strain ATCC 29213 against 10 beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillin, ampicillin, ticarcillin, cefazolin, cefuroxime, cefoperazone, cefepime, cefoxitin, cefaclor, imipenem). This paper also presents the construction of the background instrumentation and the panel system into which a printed circuit board (PCB) based electrode was integrated. Our results suggest that MFC based biosensors have the potential to be used in diagnostics for antibiogram determination.",

Here, we cloned the fifth and sixth genes (Pcabf43B and Pcabf51C) encoding the ABFs PcABF43B and PcABF51C in this strain and overexpressed these genes in Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequences of PcABF43B and PcABF51C were highly similar to putative ABFs belonging to glycoside hydrolase families 43 and 51, respectively. Semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction indicated that both genes were induced by arabinose, arabinitol, arabinan, and arabinoxylan; however, the Pcabf51C gene was constitutively expressed at low levels in P. chrysogenum 31B. PcABF43B had optimal activity at 20 °C and pH 5–6, indicating that this enzyme was psychrophilic and had the lowest optimal temperature reported for ABFs. PcABF51C had optimal activity at 45 °C and pH 6–7. Both recombinant enzymes showed high activity on arabino-oligosaccharides, but little activity on arabinose-containing polysaccharides, such as l-arabinan. Next, we compared the substrate specificities of PcABF43B, PcABF51C, and AFQ1, a P. chrysogenum ABF that preferentially degraded oligosaccharides over polysaccharides. PcABF43B was found to preferentially hydrolyze (1→3)-linkages in branched arabino-oligosaccharides and released only a small amount of arabinose from linear α-1,5-arabino-oligosaccharides. In contrast, AFQ1 and PcABF51C showed higher activities on linear arabino-oligosaccharides than on branched arabino-oligosaccharides. AFQ1 showed high catalytic efficiencies for α-1,5-l-arabinofuranobiose (α-1,5-Ara2) and α-1,5-l-arabinofuranotriose (α-1,5-Ara3) at the same level. In contrast, intracellular PcABF51C showed much higher catalytic efficiency for α-1,5-Ara2 than for α-1,5-Ara3.",

Further, the functions and catalytic mechanism of the three genes sviOMT02, sviOMT03 and sviOMT06 from this strain were studied through experimental and computational approaches. As a result, the nine putative O-methyltransferases belong to methyltransf_2 superfamily, amdomet-MTases superfamily, and leucine carboxyl methyltransferase superfamily, and are phylogenetically close to those of Streptomyces sp. C. The products of genes sviOMT03 and sviOMT06 could catalyze O-methylation of caffeic acid to form ferulic acid. Computational analysis indicated that the O-methylation mechanism of SviOMT03 and SviOMT06 proceeds from a direct transfer of the SAM-methyl group to caffeic acid with inversion of symmetry aided by a divalent metal ion in a SN2-like mechanism. Particularly, the conservative polar amino acid residues in SviOMT03 and SviOMT06, including Lys143 that reacts with caffeic acid, Ser74, Asp140 and Tyr149 that react with S-adenosyl methionine, and His142 (SviOMT03) or His171 (SviOMT06) that transfers the 3-hydroxyl proton of substrate caffeic acid, probably be essential in their O-methylation.",

The recombinant enzyme, rXyn10C, was produced by Escherichia coli and characterized. rXyn10C was highly active toward soluble xylans derived from rye, birchwood, and oat spelt, and slightly active toward insoluble wheat arabinoxylan. It hydrolyzed xylooligosaccharides larger than xylotetraose to produce xylotriose, xylobiose, and xylose. When rye arabinoxylan and oat spelt xylan were treated with the enzyme and the hydrolysis products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC), two unknown hydrolysis products, U1 and U2, were detected in the upper position of xylose on a TLC plate. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and enzymatic analysis using Bacillus licheniformis α-l-arabinofuranosidase Axh43A indicated that U1 was α-l-Araf-(1 → 2)-[α-l-Araf-(1 → 3)]-d-Xylp and U2 was α-l-Araf-(1 → 2)-d-Xylp, suggesting that rXyn10C had strong activity toward a xylosidic linkage before and after a doubly arabinose-substituted xylose residue and was able to accommodate an α-1,2- and α-1,3-linked arabinose-substituted xylose unit in both the −1 and +1 subsites. A molecular docking study suggested that rXyn10C could accommodate a doubly arabinose-substituted xylose residue in its catalytic site, at subsite −1.

Nevertheless, a high enzyme dosage is still required in the conversion of (hemi)cellulose. The interaction between cellulases and xylanases seems to be an effective alternative to reduce enzyme loading in the saccharification process. At first, to evaluate the synergism of xylanases on bagasse degradation, we have produced two xylanases from glycoside hydrolase family 10 (GH10) and three xylanases from glycoside hydrolase family 11 (GH11), from two thermophilic organisms, Thermobifida fusca and Clostridium thermocellum, and one mesophilic organism, Streptomyces lividans. Peracetic acid (PAA) pretreated bagasse was used as substrate. The combination of XynZ-C (GH10, from C. thermocellum), and XlnB (GH11, from S. lividans) presented the highest degree of synergy after 6 h (3.62). However, the combination of XynZ-C and Xyn11A (GH11, from T. fusca) resulted in the highest total yield of reducing sugars. To evaluate the synergism between xylanases and cellulases, commercial cellulase preparation from Trichoderma reesei was combined with the selected xylanases, XynZ-C and Xyn11A. About 2-fold increase was observed in the concentration of reducing sugars, when both xylanases, XynZ-C and Xyn11A, were added together with T. reesei cellulases in the reaction mixture.",

With prominent inner membrane areas and efficient endogenous translocation machineries, they are especially attractive for membrane protein expression. However, codon usage bias could be a limitation in the engineering of Rhodobacter species and has seldom been investigated. In this study, we tackled the codon bias of Rhodobacter by functionally expressing 8 rare tRNAs of Rhodobacter sphaeroides with a multi-copy vector. The impact of tRNA supplementation was evaluated through monitoring expression levels of two heterologous proteins with different phylogenetic origins, a membrane subunit of the riboflavin transporter, RibU, from Lactobacillus acidophilus La-14 and a decaheme cytochrome, MtrA, from Shewanella oneidensis. Our results showed that the performances were closely related to medium composition and rare codon percentages of raw DNA sequences. Provision of rare tRNAs has increased RibU production by 7.7-folds and 2.86-fold in minimal medium and rich medium, respectively, while MtrA levels were increased by 1-fold in minimal medium. The present study confirms the presence of codon bias in R. sphaeroides and offers a facile tool for improving heterologous expression of rare-codon containing genes. We anticipate that this tRNA supplementation system can be further extended to other species of Rhodobacter, and thus will facilitate the engineering of purple bacteria for interesting applications in microbial technology.",

In Saccharothrix algeriensis NRRL B-24137, two acyltransferases, an acetyltransferase and a benzoyltransferase were proposed to catalyze this step. We have previously identified, in Sa. algeriensis genome, two open read frames, actA and actB patiently encoded these enzymes. This study focuses primarily on the characterization of the protein encoded by actA. After cloning and expressing of actA in Escherichia coli BL21, the recombinant protein encoded by actA was purified. Selectivity of ActA for pyrrothine/holothin as substrate and different acyl-CoA as co-substrate was evaluated using two acyls-groups, linear and aromatic. The enzyme was shown to prefer aromatic groups over linear groups as donor group; further neither product nor transfer was observed for linear groups. Therefore ActA has been determined to be a pyrrothine/holothin N-benzoyltransferase which can either pyrrothine (Km of 72 μM) or holothin (Km of 129.5 μM) as substrates and benzoyl-CoA (Km of 348.65 and 395.28 μM) as co-substrates for pyrrothine and holothin, respectively.

This work was aimed at developing consistent and efficient assays for polygalacturonase and pectinase activities, using polygalacturonic acid and citrus pectin, respectively, as the substrate. Different enzyme mixtures produced by Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma reesei with different inducing carbon sources were used for the method development. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the incubation time, substrate concentration, and enzyme dilution. Accordingly, for both assays the recommended (optimal) hydrolysis time is 30 min and substrate concentration is 5 g/L. For polygalacturonase, the sample should be adjusted to have 0.3–0.8 U/mL polygalacturonase activity, because in this range the assay outcomes were consistent (independent of dilution factors). Such a range did not exist for the pectinase assay. The recommended procedure is to assay the sample at multiple (at least 2) dilution factors and determine, by linear interpolation, the dilution factor that would release reducing sugar equivalent to 0.4 g/L d-galacturonic acid, and then calculate the activity of the sample accordingly (dilution factor × 0.687 U/mL).

In this study, the oxidative MWCNTs prepared using a mixture of HNO3 and H2SO4 (1:3 v/v) were used as a supportive material for the immobilization of Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) through physical adsorption process. The resulting CRL-MWCNTs biocatalysts were utilized for synthesizing geranyl propionate, an important ester for flavoring agent as well as in fragrances. Enzymatic esterification of geraniol with propionic acid was carried out using heptane as a solvent and the efficiency of CRL-MWCNTs as a biocatalyst was compared with the free CRL, considering the incubation time, temperature, molar ratio of acid:alcohol, presence of desiccant as well as its reusability. It was found that the CRL-MWCNTs resulted in a 2-fold improvement in the percentage of conversion of geranyl propionate when compared with the free CRL, demonstrating the highest yield of geranyl propionate at 6 h at 55 °C, molar ratio acid: alcohol of 1:5 and with the presence of 1.0 g desiccant. It was evident that the CRL-MWCNTs biocatalyst could be reused for up to 6 times before a 50% reduction in catalytic efficiency was observed. Hence, it appears that the facile physical adsorption of CRL onto F-MWCNTs has improved the activity and stability of CRL as well as served as an alternative method for the synthesis of geranyl propionate.",

Therefore, we studied the relationship between visible-light irradiation and peroxidase-like activity of magnetosomes extracted from M. magneticum strain AMB-1. We then compared this characteristic with that of HRP, iron ions, and naked magnetosomes using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine as a peroxidase substrate in the presence of H2O2. Results showed that HRP and iron ions had different activities from those of magnetosomes and naked magnetosomes when exposed to visible-light irradiation. Magnetosomes and naked magnetosomes had enhanced peroxidase-like activities under visible-light irradiation, but magnetosomes showed less affinity toward substrates than naked magnetosomes under visible-light irradiation. These results suggested that the peroxidase-like activity of magnetosomes may follow an ordered ternary mechanism rather than a ping–pong mechanism. This finding may provide new insight into the function of magnetosomes in the phototaxis in magnetotactic bacteria.",

In order to understand its molecular machinery, the crystal structure of CtLic16A was determined to 1.95 Å resolution. The enzyme folds into a classic GH16 β-jellyroll architecture which consists of two β-sheets atop each other, with the substrate-binding cleft lying on the concave side of the inner β-sheet. Two Bis–Tris propane molecules were found in the positive and negative substrate binding sites. Structural analysis suggests that the major differences between the CtLic16A and other GH16 β-1,3-1,4-glucanase structures occur at the protein exterior. Furthermore, the high catalytic efficacy and thermal profile of the CtLic16A are preserved in the enzyme produced in Pichia pastoris, encouraging its further commercial applications.",

An ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer was used to efficiently measure the liberated p-nitrophenol without extraction or centrifugation. Several factors that affected lipase activity were investigated, such as the ratio of p-NPP ethanol solution to buffer, the concentrations of p-NPP and lipase, as well as the temperature, reaction time, pH and agitation rate. Additionally, enzyme catalytic parameters such as Km, Vm and “activation energy” were also assessed.

     "abstract": "Numerous biopharmaceuticals are produced in recombinant microorganisms in the controlled environment of a bioreactor, a process known as Upstream Process. To minimize product loss due to physico-chemical and enzymatic degradation, the Upstream Process should be directly followed by product purification, known as Downstream Process. However, the Downstream Process can be technologically complex and time-consuming which is why Upstream and Downstream Process usually have to be decoupled temporally and spatially. Consequently, the product obtained after the Upstream Process, known as intermediate bulk, has to be stored. In those circumstances, a freezing procedure is often performed to prevent product loss. However, the freezing process itself is inseparably linked to physico-chemical changes of the intermediate bulk which may in turn damage the product.The present study analysed the behaviour of a Tris-buffered intermediate bulk containing a biopharmaceutically relevant protein during a bottle freezing process. Major damaging mechanisms, like the spatiotemporal redistribution of ion concentrations and pH, and their influence on product stability were investigated. Summarizing, we show the complex events which happen in an intermediate bulk during freezing and explain the different causes for product loss.",

Due to the limitations of chemical synthesis of these hydroxylated structures, alternative enzymatic synthesis has been attempted. Previously, several protein-engineering approaches using CYP102D1 were investigated; these produced mutants with daidzein hydroxylation activity and regioselectivity through rational design (F96V/M246I) and saturation mutagenesis (A273H/G274E/T277G). However, the generated mutants have low regioselectivity (F96V/M246I) or low hydroxylation activity (A273H/G274E/T277G). Here, we characterized mutants capable of catalyzing C3′-specific daidzein hydroxylation with enhanced hydroxylation activity and regioselectivity. In order to obtain regioselectivity toward the daidzein C3′-position, site-saturation mutagenesis on the substrate-binding region of CYP102D1 F96V/M246I was investigated. A high-throughput screening assay was then performed, based on O-dealkylation activity against the daidzein analog substrate 4′-O-methyl-daidzein. This resulted in a mutant with more than 23-fold improved hydroxylation activity (55.6 ± 17.9 μM−1 min−1, or 48.4 mg/L titer) and regioselectivity over the 3′/6-position that was increased by three-fold (from 0.9 to 2.6) compared with the F96V/M246I template enzyme. Furthermore, we carried out docking simulation studies that could partially explain the effects of these mutations on C3′-specific hydroxylation activity.",

AguA released xylotriose and HexA from ΔX3, but the Vmax and kcat values for ΔX3 were lower than those for MeGlcA, indicating that HexA side groups may affect the hydrolytic activity. To explore the potential for biological bleaching, ΔX3 degradation was performed using intracellular extract from P. curdlanolyticus B-6. The intracellular extract, with synergistic α-glucuronidase and β-xylosidase activities, degraded ΔX3 to xylose and HexA.

Variants evolved on propanal were found previously with nascent activity on polar aromatic aldehydes 3-formylbenzoic acid (3-FBA), 4-formylbenzoic acid (4-FBA), and 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde (3-HBA), suggesting a potential novel route to analogues of chloramphenicol. Here we evolved improved transketolase activities towards aromatic aldehydes, by saturation mutagenesis of two active-site residues (R358 and S385), predicted to interact with the aromatic substituents. S385 variants selectively controlled the aromatic substrate preference, with up to 13-fold enhanced activities, and KM values comparable to those of natural substrates with wild-type transketolase. S385E even completely removed the substrate inhibition for 3-FBA, observed in all previous variants. The mechanisms of catalytic improvement were both mutation type and substrate dependent. S385E improved 3-FBA activity via kcat, but reduced 4-FBA activity via KM. Conversely, S385Y/T improved 3-FBA activity via KM and 4-FBA activity via kcat. This suggested that both substrate proximity and active-site orientation are very sensitive to mutation. Comparison of all variant activities on each substrate indicated different binding modes for the three aromatic substrates, supported by computational docking. This highlights a potential divergence in the evolution of different substrate specificities, with implications for enzyme engineering.",

The inhibition of the immobilized preparations with diethyl p-nitrophenylphosphate (D-pNPP) was analyzed. The inhibition was more rapid using octyl-lipase preparations than using covalent preparations, and the covalent preparations were much more sensitive to the reaction medium. The addition of detergent increased the inhibition rate of the covalent preparation while an increase on the ionic strength produced a slowdown of the inhibition rate by D-pNPP for both lipases. The effect of the medium on the activity versus fully soluble substrate (methyl mandelate) was in the same direction. The octyl preparations presented a slight decrease in activity when comparing the results using different concentrations of sodium phosphate buffer (between 0.025 and 1 M), while the CNBr preparations suffered drastic drops in its activity at high ionic strength.The results confirm that the lipases immobilized on octyl agarose presented their open form stabilized while the covalent preparation maintains a closing/opening equilibrium that may be modulated by altering the medium.",

The ability of Pseudozyma antarctica PYCC 5048T and Pseudozyma aphidis PYCC 5535T to use cellulose (Avicel®) and xylan (beechwood) as carbon and energy source has been assessed along with their capacity of producing cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes, toward a consolidated bioprocess (CBP) for MEL production. The yeasts assessed were neither able to grow in medium containing Avicel® nor produce cellulolytic enzymes under the conditions tested. On contrary, both yeasts were able to efficiently grow in xylan, but MEL production was only detected in P. antarctica PYCC 5048T cultures. MEL titers reached 1.3 g/l after 10 days in batch cultures with 40 g/l xylan, and 2.0 g/l in fed-batch cultures with xylan feeding (additional 40 g/l) at day 4.

     "abstract": "This study investigated the behavior of mannan-degrading enzymes, specifically focusing on differences with respect to their substrate specificities and their synergistic associations with enzymes from different glycoside hydrolase (GH) families. Galactosidases from Cyamopsis tetragonolobus seeds (Aga27A, GH27) and Aspergillus niger (AglC, GH36) were evaluated for their abilities to synergistically interact with mannanases from Clostridium cellulovorans (ManA, GH5) and A. niger (Man26A, GH26) in hydrolysis of guar gum and locust bean gum. Among the mannanases, Man26A was more efficient at hydrolyzing both galactomannan substrates, while among the galactosidases; Aga27A was the most effective at removing galactose substituents on both galactomannan substrates and galactose-containing oligosaccharides. An optimal protein mass ratio of glycoside hydrolases required to maximize the release of both reducing sugar and galactose residues was determined. Clear synergistic enhancement of locust bean gum hydrolysis with respect to reducing sugar release was observed when both mannanases at 75% enzyme dosage were supplemented with 25% enzyme protein dosage of Aga27A. At a protein ratio of 75% Man26A to 25% Aga27A, the presence of Man26A significantly enhanced galactose release by 25% Aga27A (2.36 fold) with locust bean gum, compared to when Aga27A was used alone at 100% enzyme protein dosage. A dosage of Aga27A at 75% and ManA at 25% protein content liberated the highest reducing sugar release on guar gum hydrolysis. A dosage of Man26A and Aga27A at 75–25% protein content, respectively, liberated reducing sugar release equivalent to that when Man26A was used alone at 100% protein content. From the findings obtained in this study, it was observed that the GH family classification of an enzyme affects its substrate specificity and synergistic interactions with other glycoside hydrolases from different families (more so than its EC classification). The GH26 Man26A and GH27 Aga27A enzymes appeared to be more promising for applications that involve the hydrolysis of galactomannan containing biomass. This method of screening for maximal compatibility between various GH families can ultimately lead to a more rational development of tailored enzyme cocktails for lignocellulose hydrolysis.",

     "abstract": "The cyanide-mediated ring opening of epoxides catalyzed by halohydrin dehalogenases yields β-hydroxynitriles that are of high interest for synthetic chemistry. The best studied halohydrin dehalogenase to date is the enzyme from Agrobacterium radiobacter, but this enzyme (HheC) exhibits only low cyanolysis activities. Sequence comparison between a pair of related halohydrin dehalogenases from Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium suggested that substitution of a threonine that interacts with the active site might be responsible for the higher cyanolytic activity of the former enzyme. Here we report that a variant of HheC in which this substitution (T134A) is adopted displays an up to 11-fold higher activity in cyanide-mediated epoxide ring-opening. The mutation causes removal of the hydrogen bond between residue 134 and the side chain O of the active site serine 132, which donates a hydrogen bond to the substrate oxygen. The mutation also increases dehalogenase rates with various substrates. Structural analysis revealed that the anion-binding site of the mutant enzyme remained unaltered, showing that the enhanced activity is due to altered interactions with the substrate oxygen rather than changes in the nucleophile binding site.",

The catalytic efficiency and substrate specificity of FoCYP53A19 were significantly influenced and altered by the source of the reductase employed. The yeast reconstitution system of FoCYP53A19 with ScCPR performed the hydroxylation of benzoic acid (BA) and demethylation of 3-methoxybenzoic acid (3-MBA); but when reconstituted with CaCPR, FoCYP53A19 performed only the essential hydroxylation of fungal benzoate catabolism. Remarkably, FoCYP53A19 with its homologous reductase FoCPR, not only demonstrated the improved conversion rates of BA and 3-MBA, but also exhibited activity toward the hydroxylation of 3-hydroxybenzoic acid. The electron transfer compatibility and the coupling efficiency between the homologous FoCYP-FoCPR system are significant and it favored enhanced monooxygenase activity with broader substrate specificity.",

The increase of pressure up to 500 MPa at 80 °C decreased only slightly the enzyme's stability, whereas in 500 MPa the increase of temperature from 22 to 80 °C decreased significantly more the enzyme's stability. While the high temperature (80–100 °C) decreased the enzyme reaction with short xylooligosaccharides (xylotetraose and xylotriose), the high pressure (100–300 MPa) had an opposite effect. The temperature of 100 °C strongly increased the Km but did not affect the kcat to the same extent, thus indicating that the interaction of the substrate with the active site suffers before the catalytic reaction begins to decrease as the temperature rises.

Gldh was detected mainly in the outer membrane fraction, suggesting that the Gldh was displayed on the bacterial cell surface. The optimal temperature and pH for the bacteria cell-surface displayed Gldh (bacteria-Gldh) were 70 °C and 9.0, respectively. Additionally, the fusion protein retained almost 100% of its initial enzymatic activity after 1 month incubation at 4 °C. Transition metal ions could inhibit the enzyme activity to different extents, while common anions had little adverse effect on enzyme activity. Importantly, the displayed Gldh is most specific to l-glutamate reported so far. The bacterial Gldh was enabled to catalyze oxidization of l-glutamate with NADP+ as cofactor, and the resultant NADPH can be detected spectrometrically at 340 nm. The bacterial-Gldh based l-glutamate assay was established, where the absorbance at 340 nm increased linearly with the increasing l-glutamate concentration within the range of 10 − 400 μM.

Their optimal activities are exhibited at pH 7.0–7.5 at 30 °C. Activity of CpGSTd1 is strongly inhibited by cantharidin and cantharidic acid, but is only slightly suppressed by the demethylated analog of cantharidin and cantharidic acid. Enzymatic assays revealed that cantharidin has no effect on SsGSTα1 activity, while it significantly stimulates TaGSTf3 activity, with an EC50 value of 0.3852 mM. Activities of these proteins are potently inhibited by the known GST competitive inhibitor: S-hexylglutathione (GTX).

In the present work, a bifunctional enzyme consisting of a GH11 endo-1,4-β-xylanase fused to a GH43 β-xylosidase, both from Bacillus subtilis, was designed taking into account the quaternary arrangement and accessibility to the substrate. The parental enzymes and the resulting chimera were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized. Interestingly, the substrate cleavage rate was altered by the molecular fusion improving at least 3-fold the xylose production using specific substrates as beechwood xylan and hemicelluloses from pretreated biomass. Moreover, the chimeric enzyme showed higher thermotolerance with a positive shift of the optimum temperature from 35 to 50 °C for xylosidase activity. This improvement in the thermal stability was also observed by circular dichroism unfolding studies, which seems to be related to a gain of stability of the β-xylosidase domain. These results demonstrate the superior functional and stability properties of the chimeric enzyme in comparison to individual parental domains, suggesting the molecular fusion as a promising strategy for enhancing enzyme cocktails aiming at lignocellulose hydrolysis.",

     "abstract": "Recently, microalgae was considered as a renewable energy for fuel production because its production is nonseasonal and may take place on nonarable land. Despite all of these advantages, microalgal oil production is significantly affected by environmental factors. Furthermore, the large variability remains an important problem in measurement of algae productivity and compositional analysis, especially, the total lipid content. Thus, there is considerable interest in accurate determination of total lipid content during the biotechnological process. For these reason, various high-throughput technologies were suggested for accurate measurement of total lipids contained in the microorganisms, especially oleaginous microalgae. In addition, more advanced technologies were employed to quantify the total lipids of the microalgae without a pretreatment. However, these methods are difficult to measure total lipid content in wet form microalgae obtained from large-scale production. In present study, the thermal analysis performed with two-step linear temeperature program was applied to measure heat evolved in temperature range from 310 to 351 °C of Nostoc sp. KNUA003 obtained from large-scale cultivation. And then, we examined the relationship between the heat evolved in 310–351 °C (HE) and total lipid content of the wet Nostoc cell cultivated in raceway. As a result, the linear relationship was determined between HE value and total lipid content of Nostoc sp. KNUA003. Particularly, there was a linear relationship of 98% between the HE value and the total lipid content of the tested microorganism. Based on this relationship, the total lipid content converted from the heat evolved of wet Nostoc sp. KNUA003 could be used for monitoring its lipid induction in large-scale cultivation.",

In this study, three separate mutations (M298F, V290N and V290A) were introduced at or near the T1 copper site of the small laccase (SLAC) from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and biochemical properties were assessed in comparison with the native enzyme. The mutation, V290N showed approximately double the activity of SLAC when ABTS was used as substrate while the specific activity of SLAC-M298F was 4–5 times higher than that of SLAC when the assays were performed at ≥70 °C. There was no significant difference in activity with 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (2,6-DMP); however, there was a significant shift in the optimal pH from pH 9.5 (SLAC) to 7.5 (SLAC-V290N). Optimal temperature for activity was not significantly altered but thermostability was reduced in all three mutants. The substrate range of the mutant variants remained largely unchanged, with the exception of SLAC-M298F which was unable to oxidise veratryl alcohol. Interestingly, the “typical” laccase inhibitor, sodium azide, had no significant inhibitory effect on the activity of SLAC-M298F, which also exhibited increased resistance to inhibition by sulfhydryl compounds. SLAC-V290N showed higher catalytic efficiency for 2,6-DMP (kcat/Km = 2.226 mM−1 s−1) and ABTS (kcat/Km = 1.874 mM−1 s−1) compared to SLAC (kcat/Km = 1.615 mM−1 s−1 for 2,6-DMP and kcat/Km = 1.611 mM−1 s−1 for ABTS). This study has shown that three ligands that are closely associated with the T1 copper in SLAC play a key role in maintaining enzymatic activity. Whilst the introduction of mutations at these sites negated favourable characteristics such as thermostability, several favourable effects were observed. This study has also extended the knowledge base on the biochemical characteristics of SLAC, and its suitability as a template for engineering with the aim of widening its potential range of industrial applications.",

In this study, we improved the yield of glucose oxidase (GOD) by manipulating genes involved in protein folding machinery and abnormal folding stress responses. First, genes with folding and secretion functions were used to modulate the folding rate of GOD in the ER and its secretion level in the cytoplasm. Next, the potential benefits of the ERAD elements were determined. Cellular resistance to ER derived stress was then strengthened by overexpressing the stress response gene GCN4. Furthermore, a module combination strategy, which co-expressed the SEC53, CNE1 and GCN4 genes, was employed to construct the Pichia pastoris strain S17. This increased the yield of GOD to 21.81 g/L, with an activity of 1972.9 U/mL, which were 2.53- and 5.11-fold higher, respectively, than the control strain. The work described here improved GOD production significantly, and the strategies employed in this study provide novel information for the large-scale production of heterologous proteins.",

FAD-GDH was purified in two steps with the specific activity of 604 U/mg. Using d-glucose as substrate, the optimal pH and temperature for FAD-GDH were determined to be 7.5 and 50 °C, respectively. Activity was stable across the pH range 3.5–9.0, and the half-life was 52 min at 42 °C. Km and Vmax were calculated as 86.7 ± 5.3 mM and 928 ± 35 U/mg, and the molecular weight was approximately 65.6 kDa based on size exclusion chromatography, indicating a monomeric structure. The 3D structure of FAD-GDH was simulated by homology modelling using the structure of A. niger glucose oxidase (GOD) as template. From the model, His551, His508, Asn506 and Arg504 were identified as key residues, and their importance was verified by site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, three additional mutants (Arg84Ala, Tyr340Phe and Tyr406Phe) were generated and all exhibited a higher degree of substrate specificity than the native enzyme. These results extend our understanding of the structure and function of FAD-GDH, and could assist potential commercial applications.",

The expression of GPPS was optimized by using ribosomal binding sites (RBSs) designed to have different translation initiation rates (TIRs). The RBS strength in TIR window of 500 arbitrary unit (au)–1400 au for GPPS appears to be suitable for balancing the geraniol biosynthesis pathway in this study. With the TIR of 500 au, the highest production titer of geraniol was obtained at a level of 1119 mg/L, which represented a 6-fold increase in comparison with the previous titer of 183 mg/L. The TIRs of GPPS locating out of range of the optimal window (500–1400 au) caused significant decreases of cell growth and geraniol production. It was suspected to result from metabolic imbalance and plasmid instability in geraniol production by inappropriate expression level of GPP synthase. Our results collectively indicated GPPS as an important regulation point in balancing a recombinant geraniol synthesis pathway. The GPPS-based regulation approach could be applicable for optimizing microbial production of other monoterpenes.",

Among cold-active enzymes, lipases offer a great potential in detergent, cosmetic, biofuel and food or feed industries. In this paper we describe the identification of novel lipase coding genes and the expression of a lipase with high activity at low temperatures. The genomic DNA from Antarctic seawater bacteria showing lipolytic activity at 4 °C was used to amplify five DNA fragments that partially encode novel lipases using specifically designed COnsensus-DEgenerate Hybrid Oligonucleotide Primers (CODEHOP). All the fragments were found to have a high identity with an α/β-hydrolase domain-containing protein identified by the sequencing of the complete genome of Shewanella frigidimarina NCIMB 400. The complete sequence of one of the lipase-coding gene fragments, lipE13, was obtained by genome walking. Considering that the other fragments had a high identity to the putative lipase from S. frigidimarina NCIMB 400, the complete lipase genes were amplified using oligonucleotide primers designed based on the 5′ and 3′ regions of the coding sequence of the related protein.This strategy allowed the amplification of 3 lipase-encoding genes of which one was expressed in the periplasm using the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)/pET-22b(+) expression system.

However, the impact of MOS on the performance of cellulases is not yet clear. In this work, the effect of mannan and MOS in cellulose hydrolysis by cellulases, especially cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) from Thermoascus aurantiacus (Ta Cel7A), was studied. The glucose yield of Avicel decreased with an increasing amount of added mannan. Commercial cellulases contained mannan hydrolysing enzymes, and β-glucosidase played an important role in mannan hydrolysis. Addition of 10 mg/ml mannan reduced the glucose yield of Avicel (at 20 g/l) from 40.1 to 24.3%. No inhibition of β-glucosidase by mannan was observed. The negative effects of mannan and MOS on the hydrolytic action of cellulases indicated that the inhibitory effect was at least partly attributed to the inhibition of Ta Cel7A (CBHI), but not on β-glucosidase. Kinetic experiments showed that MOS were competitive inhibitors of the CBHI from T. aurantiacus, and mannobiose had a stronger inhibitory effect on CBHI than mannotriose or mannotetraose. For efficient hydrolysis of softwood, it was necessary to add supplementary enzymes to hydrolyze both mannan and MOS to less inhibitory product, mannose.",

Development of a better quantitation assay to measure amino acid levels will facilitate research and application in medical and industrial fields.

The resulting acetaldehyde is further converted into ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase accompanying NADH reduction. Therefore, monitoring the changes in NADH concentration can serve as a readout for the amount of threonine present within certain range. This LTA assay can distinguish a 0.5 mM difference in threonine concentration in some certain mediums. We successfully utilized this assay to measure l-threonine levels in industrial fermentation samples. Moreover, we were able to scale up this assay to 96-well format and use it in high-throughput screening of threonine-overproducing strains.

Additionally, in SGJS47, improvement in free fatty acid (FFA) composition, high-specificity production of short-chain fatty acids (C8, C10) and unsaturated fatty acids (C16:1) was achieved in crude glycerol medium condition. Compared with control strain, the percentage of FFAs (C8 and C10) was enhanced by approximately 16- to 21-fold, C16:1 FFA ratio increased approximately 18-fold. Observation of codon-optimized acyl-ACP TE genes expression level in E. coli may be useful for understanding mechanisms towards improving fatty acid production.

Deleting Trpac1 dramatically increased the cellulase production and the transcription levels of the major cellulase genes at neutral pH, which suggested Trpac1 is involved in the regulation of cellulase production. It was further observed that the expression levels of transcription factors xyr1 and ace2 also increased in the ΔTrpac1 mutant at neutral pH.

For galactose oxidation on immobilized GAD in a microreactor, TERO generation immediately increased enzyme activity 2- to 3-fold. Eliminating TERO caused a slight decrease in the activity, with ∼90% of the enhanced activity retained while the reaction proceeded. Contact of the enhanced enzyme with a galactose-free solution caused almost complete reversion of the activity to the original low level before TERO generation, indicating that, not only TERO-induced GAD activation, but also preservation of the increased activity, required a galactose substrate. Similar activity changes with TERO were observed for enzyme reactions on DAAO and LAAO. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that TERO helped strengthen the interactions of the immobilized enzyme with the reactant substrate and promoted formation of an activation complex.",

It was also found that NaF weakened the oxidative damage of cell membrane and led to lower content of malonyl dialdehyde (MDA) in NaF-treated cells compared with the control cells. The MDA content of NaF-treated cells decreased 91% compared to the controls. Although lower membrane lipid peroxidation in NaF-treated cells, its membrane permeability was higher than the control cells and showed a high product secret rate.

The construct was prepared through kringle 2 domain removal and replacement of t-PA finger domain with b-PA one. In addition, the KHRR sequence at the initial part of protease domain was replaced by four alanine residues. The novel construct was integrated in Pichia pastoris genome by electroporation.

The activity of the recombinant protein in the presence of fibrin was 1560 times more than its activity in the absence of fibrin, showing its higher specificity to fibrin. The fibrin binding of CT-b was 1.2 fold more than t-PA. In addition, it was inhibited by PAI enzyme 44% less than t-PA. Although the presented data demonstrate a promising in vitro activity, more in vivo studies are needed to confirm the therapeutic advantage of this novel plasminogen activator.",

     "abstract": "Identification of microorganisms for the production of carbohydrolytic enzymes is extremely important given the increased demand for these enzymes in many industries. To this end, dye–polysaccharide interactions which provide a visual indication of polymer hydrolysis (clear zones or halos) have been used for decades. For the detection of extracellular cellulase or xylanase activity many laboratories use Gram's iodine as the chromogenic dye, as it is a more rapid initial screening method compared to the use of other dyes. Here, we compared Gram's iodine and Congo red as indicators of polysaccharide hydrolysis. We attempted to detect cellulase activity using carboxymethylcellulose, and xylanase activity using birchwood xylan, in fourteen uncharacterized bacteria isolated from wood chips. Our results indicate that Gram's iodine may lead to identification of false positives in a typical screening protocol and that Congo red allows for avoidance of such pitfall. Congo red allowed detection of cellulase activity from live microbial colonies but not Gram's iodine. To confirm this, detection of enzymatic activity was also assessed using cell-free enzyme preparations. Congo red was found to be reliable in detecting cellulase activity with isolated enzymes preparations. Under the same conditions, neither of these dyes detected xylanase activity, despite independent evidence of xylanase activity for one of the preparations. We detected xylanase activity for this particular enzyme preparation using a coloured derivative of xylan (Remazol Brillant Blue R-xylan adduct) that respond to xylan hydrolysis. Our results suggest that methods that rely on interactions between a dye (Congo red or Gram's iodine) and a polymeric substrate (carboxymethylcellulose or birchwood xylan) for indirect detection of hydrolysis may require the use of relevant controls and independent confirmation of enzymatic activities.",

However, elicitation at the dose of 50 μg l−1 has been found to be most effective and intracellular RA content reached almost ∼1.6-fold (p < 0.01) higher in day 7. Therefore, A. alternata (50 μg l−1) was selected for mechanism evaluation. A significant elevation of intercellular jasmonic acid was observed up to day 6 after elicitation with A. alternata (50 μg l−1). A significant increase in tissue H2O2 and lipid peroxidation coupled with depletion of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase indicated augmented oxidative stress associated with biotic interaction. Preceding the elicitor-induced RA accumulation, a notable alteration in the specific activities of biosynthetic enzymes namely PAL and TAT was recorded, while, no significant change in the activities of RAS was observed. HPPR activity was slightly improved in elicited plant. Therefore, it could be concluded that A. alternata elicited the biosynthesis of rosmarinic acid via signal transduction through jasmonic acid coupled with elicitor induced oxidative stress and associated mechanism.",

First, the properties of the outer membrane particle, such as the particle size, zeta potential, and total protein, were compared with the properties of particles obtained using the previous preparation methods. Compared with the conventional isolation method using an enzyme treatment, the ultrasonic method exhibited a higher efficiency at isolating the outer membrane and less contamination by cytosolic proteins. The isolated outer membrane particles were layered on a gold surface, and the roughness and thickness of the layered outer membrane layers were subsequently analyzed using AFM analysis.

Pure maltose and glucose media (80, 100 and 140 g/l) were examined as model substrates to evaluate the potential effect of TC on the rate of fermentation of maltose containing substrates. The use of TC sharply accelerated the rate of maltose fermentation compared to free cells (FC) in suspension. Fermentation at 5 °C by immobilized cells was complete, while FC were unable to ferment maltose at this temperature, in contrast to glucose, which was completely fermented. From the results of maltose and glucose fermentations at 5 and 10 °C, it was concluded that the effect of TC was higher at lower fermentation temperature and that its promotional effect on fermentation rate had to be at the step of maltose uptake. Specifically, it is suggested that the presence of TC increased maltose uptake rate by the immobilized cells due to attraction by hydrogen bonding on the TC surface and continuous pumping of maltose towards the cells. Calculation of the activation energy of maltose fermentations at 5, 10 and 15 °C showed that it was reduced by an average 42% when cells immobilized on TC were used.",

Two distinct forms of recombinant xylanase with different hydrophobicities and molecular weights were found in the broth after purification. According to the results of Western blotting, only the T7-tag, fused in the N-terminus of XynR8, could be bound to the expressed proteins, which indicated that the C-terminus of XynR8 had been truncated. These results, combined with tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry analyses, allow us to attribute the two xylanase forms to an optional cleavage of C-terminal sequences, and XynR8A, a 13 amino acid residues truncated form, and XynR8B, a 22 amino acid residues truncated form, were the main products in the extracellular fraction of L. reuteri R8.

Both forms of recombinant xylanase displayed a typical endoxylanase activity when they were reacted with xylan, but XynR8A demonstrated a better specific activity, catalytic efficiency and thermostability than XynR8B according to the results of enzyme characterization. These changes in enzyme properties were highly possibly caused by the present of the β-sheet in the C-terminal undeleted fragment of XynR8A.

     "abstract": "S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is an effective sedative, a good sleep modulator, and a new anticonvulsant. SAH can be synthesized from adenosine and homocysteine by using microbial S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHase). The extremely thermostable SAHase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from Thermotoga maritima were successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and purified by heat treatments. The SAHase exhibited the highest activity at 85 °C and pH 8.0 with a specific activity of 6.2 U/mg when NAD concentration was 1 mM. However, optimal SAHase reaction conditions shifted to 100 °C and pH 11.2, and its specific activity increased to 36.8 U/mg after NAD concentration was raised to 8 mM. Biosynthesis of SAH at 85 °C largely increased the adenosine solubility which was a limiting factor for improving the titer of product. At 85 °C and pH 8.0, 24 μmol of SAH was obtained when 0.5 mg of SAHase was applied to a 10 ml reaction mixture. The SAH production was further increased to 153 μmol by adding LDH and pyruvate into the reaction mixture for NAD regeneration. Therefore, extremely thermostable enzymes SAHase and LDH from T. maritima form an efficient NAD consumption and regeneration system for SAH biosynthesis. This method has great potential for industrial-scale enzymatic production of SAH.",

In this study, thirty-one hydrolyzing enzymes were screened for the conversion of stevioside (Ste) to Ru. Recombinant lactase from Thermus thermophiles which was expressed in Escherichia coli converted stevioside to rubusoside as a main product.

To address these problems, a novel non-woven Bombyx mori silk screen based spinfilter module for clog-free extended perfusion culture of hybridoma cells has been designed. The module is versatile in nature and reusable, after autoclaving and replacement of used polymeric membrane. Its application for clog-free extended perfusion culture was demonstrated by comparative perfusion experiments of HB8696 cells with stainless-steel spinfilter. HB8696 cells produce monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 520C9 active against breast cancer oncoprotein. Silk spinfilter was found to be less prone to clog with cells and debris owing to its negatively charged hydrophobic screen compared to the positively charged hydrophilic stainless-steel spinfilter. Therefore, it provides extended cell growth phase and production phase of up to 56 h and 40 h respectively and 57.4% increase in MAb productivity compared to the stainless-steel spinfilter.

With the aim to analyze the effect of several interacting reaction parameters on the product yield, we studied the conversion of 1-palmitoyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lyso-PC) with oleic acid as model reaction in mixtures of glycerol and methanol or ethanol by methods of experimental design. PLA2 from porcine pancreas (ppPLA2) and from bee venom (bvPLA2) were compared as catalysts. For each of the four systems, nine variables were evaluated using Plackett-Burman designs. The most significant four variables were used for subsequent modified D-optimal designs with 30 runs, yielding regression equations for describing the formation of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine as a function of the variables. In both solvent systems ppPLA2 was more appropriate for the acylation reaction than bvPLA2. Methanol proved to be more convenient as co-solvent than ethanol. The catalysis by ppPLA2 was more sensitive toward the variables temperature and concentration of Tris–HCl, whereas the reaction time and enzyme activity were more important in the acylation by bvPLA2.

Our results revealed that the low-affinity HXT1 permease allowed the maximal consumption of sugars and ethanol production rates during xylose/glucose co-fermentations, but was incapable to allow xylose uptake when this sugar was the only carbon source. The moderately high-affinity HXT5 permease was a poor glucose transporter, and it also did not allow significant xylose uptake by the cells. The moderately high-affinity HXT2 permease allowed xylose uptake with the same rates as those observed during glucose consumption, even under co-fermentation conditions, but had the drawback of producing incomplete fermentations. Finally, the high-affinity HXT7 permease allowed efficient xylose fermentation, but during xylose/glucose co-fermentations this permease showed a clear preference for glucose. Thus, our results indicate that approaches to engineer S. cerevisiae HXT transporters to improve second generation bioethanol production need to consider the composition of the biomass sugar syrup, whereby the HXT1 transporter seems more suitable for hydrolysates containing xylose/glucose blends, whereas the HXT7 permease would be a better choice for xylose-enriched sugar streams.",

For instance, hydrolysis yield of 87.13% was obtained in system containing 30 wt% [TBP][Tf-ILe] with pH control (pH 7.6). Since the phase-separation of this medium system can be reversible switched from single to two phases by slightly changing the solution temperature, enzymatic hydrolytic reaction and product recovery were more efficient than those of aqueous system.

The present work explores the applicability of the system as a tunable platform for the shape and size selective synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles under ambient conditions. Significant changes in the nanoscale morphology of ZnO have been observed, using scanning electron microscopy, with respect to changes in pH and gas atmosphere of the medium. More specifically, hexagonal plates of nanoscale ZnO were formed at pH below the isoelectric point of the enzyme and spherical particles at alkaline pH. Interestingly the average particle size of ZnO nanostructures increases with increasing oxygen content at acidic pH while the opposite trend is noticed at alkaline pH. The observations are explained on the basis of changes in the enzyme's surface charge, conformation and redox potential using a combination of techniques like zeta potential measurements, FTIR spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, open circuit potential studies and cyclic voltammetry. Thus the present work demonstrates the applicability of an enzyme as a dynamic bio-template for the synthesis of a multitude of ZnO nanostructures which are expected to add newer insight into bottom-up fabrication of oxide nanostructures.",

To broaden the active range of the GAD GadB1 from Lactobacillus brevis Lb85 toward a near-neutral pH, irrational design using directed evolution and rational design using site-specific mutagenesis were performed. For directed evolution of GadB1, a sensitive high-throughput screening strategy based on a pH indicator was established. One improved mutant, GadB1T17I/D294G/Q346H, was selected from 800 variants after one round of EP-PCR. It exhibited 3.9- and 25.0-fold increase in activity and catalytic efficiency, respectively at pH 6.0. Through site-specific mutagenesis, several improved mutants were obtained, with GadB1E312S being the best one. The combined mutant GadB1T17I/D294G/E312S/Q346H showed even higher catalytic efficiency, 13.1- and 43.2-fold that of wild-type GadB1 at pH 4.6 and 6.0, respectively.

The potential of biomass saccharifying enzymes, endoglucanases (EG) from a thermophilic bacterium (Thermotoga maritima) and a mesophilic fungus (Trichoderma longibrachiatum), to retain their activity in aqueous buffer, acidified glycerol, and acidified ethylene glycol used as co-solvents at pretreatment temperatures at or below 100 °C were examined. The results show that despite its origin, T. longibrachiatum EG (Tl-EG) retained 75% of its activity after exposure to 100 °C for 5 min in aqueous buffer while T. maritima EG (Tm-EG) retained only 5% activity. However, at 90 °C both enzymes retained over 87% of their activity. In acidified (0.1% (w/w) H2SO4) glycerol, Tl-EG retained similar activity (80%) to that obtained in glycerol alone, while Tm-EG retained only 35%. With acidified ethylene glycol under these conditions, both Tl-EG and Tm-EG retained 36% of their activity. The results therefore show that Tl-EG is more stable in both acidified glycerol and ethylene glycol than Tm-EG. A preliminary kinetic study showed that pure glycerol improved the thermal stability of Tl-EG but destabilized Tm-EG, relative to the buffer solution. The half-lives of both Tl-EG and Tm-EG are 4.5 min in acidified glycerol, indicating that the effectiveness of these enzymes under typical pretreatment times of greater than 15 min will be considerably diminished. Attempts have been made to explain the differences in the results obtained between the two enzymes.",

Both immobilized preparations have been incubated in dextran sulfate (DS) or polyethylenimine (PEI) solutions to coat the enzyme surface. Then, the activity versus different substrates and under different experimental conditions was evaluated. The PEI coating generally produced a significant increase in enzyme activity, in some cases even by more than a 30-fold factor (using the octyl-Lecitase at pH 5 in the hydrolysis of methyl phenyl acetate). In opposition, the DS coating usually produced some negative effects on the enzyme activity. The rate of irreversible inhibition of the covalent preparation using diethyl p-nitrophenylphosphate did not increase after PEI coating suggesting that the increase in Lecitase activity is not a consequence of the stabilization of the open form of Lecitase. Moreover, the coating greatly increased the stability of the immobilized Lecitase, for example using DS and the covalent preparation, the half-life was increased by a 30-fold factor in 30% acetonitrile. The stabilizing effect was not found in all cases, in certain cases even a certain destabilization is found (e.g., octyl-Lecitase-DS at pH 7).

High substrate conversion efficiency was coupled with low enantioselectivity, however 29% enantiomeric excess was detected in the case of 2-(2-nitropropyl)pyridine. It was shown that electronic properties of the aromatic ring, which affected polarity of the double bond, were not highly influential factors in the reduction process, but the presence of the nitro functionality was essential for the reaction to proceed. 1-Phenyl-4-nitro-1,3-butadiene could not be biotransformed by whole cells of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 or Bacillus subtilis 168 while it was successfully reduced by E. coli DH5α but with lower efficiency in comparison to E. coli BL21(DE3).

This fast and low-cost immobilization method produced enzymatically active layers on different solid supports.As model enzymes the well-characterized Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase and a new threonine aldolase from Ashbya gossypii were used. It was shown that T. lanuginosus lipase recombinantly expressed in Aspergillus oryzae is a monomeric enzyme with a molecular mass of 34 kDa, while A. gossypii threonine aldolase expressed in Escherichia coli is a pyridoxal-5′-phosphate binding homotetramer with a mass of 180 kDa.The enzymes were used freeze dried, in four different preparations: freely diffusing, adsorbed on octyl sepharose, as well as cross-linked enzyme aggregates or as suspensions in organic solvent. They were mixed with standard two-component resins and prepared as layers on solid supports made of different materials e.g. metal, glass, polyester. Polymerization led to encapsulated enzyme preparations showing activities comparable to literature values.",

Stainless steel mesh and carbon felt were employed to fabricate membrane modules, and the two MFC systems were termed as M1 and M2, respectively. High effluent quality was obtained with M1 and M2 in terms of turbidity, COD and ammonium. In M1, no bioelectrochemical denitrification took place, while nitrate decreased from 35.88 ± 4.15 to 27.33 ± 5.32 mg-N/L through the membrane in M2, causing a removal efficiency of 23.3 ± 6.5% with respect to cathodic nitrate. The denitrification ceased without electricity. The maximum power densities of M1 and M2 were 121 and 1253 mW/m3, respectively. Micrococcus bacteria and rod-shaped bacteria covered the surface of carbon felt and fewer bacteria were found on stainless steel mesh. According to fluorescence in situ hybridization, the putative bacteria affiliated with Paracoccus genus and Pseudomonas spp. dominated in the interior biofilm on carbon felt for denitrification. Results demonstrate that the carbon felt system can perform bioelectrochemical denitrification to polish the effluent.",

     "abstract": "In order to mitigate CO2 accumulation and decrease the rate of global warming and climate change, we previously presented a strategy for the development of an efficient CO2 capture and utilization system. The system employs two recombinant enzymes, carbonic anhydrase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, which were originated from microalgae. Although utilization of this integrated system would require a large quantity of high quality PEPCase protein, such quantities could be produced by increasing the solubility of the Phaeodactylum tricornutum PEPCase 1 (PtPEPCase 1) protein in the Escherichia coli heterologous expression system. We first expressed the putative mitochondria targeting peptide- and chloroplast transit peptide-truncated proteins of PtPEPCase 1, mPtPEPCase 1 and cPtPEPCase 1, respectively, in E. coli. After affinity chromatography, the amount of purified PEPCase protein from 500 mL of E. coli culture was greatest for cPtPEPCase 1 (1.99 mg), followed by mPtPEPCase 1 (0.82 mg) and PtPEPCase 1 (0.61 mg). Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of mPtPEPCase 1 and cPtPEPCase 1 showed approximately 1.6-fold (32.19 units/mg) and 3-fold (59.48 units/mg) increases, respectively. Therefore, cPtPEPCase 1 purified using the E. coli heterogeneous expression system could be a strong candidate for a platform technology to capture CO2 and produce value-added four-carbon platform chemicals.",

PtGR displayed an optimum pH of 7.5 and broad pH stability (pH 4.5–10). It exhibited an optimal temperature of 50 °C and was stable up to 50 °C. PtGR was found to be highly specific for glyoxylate, but it showed no detectable activity with 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate, phenylglyoxylate, pyruvate, oxaloacetate and α-ketoglutarate. PtGR prefered NADPH rather than NADH as an electron donor. Moreover, the crystal structure of PtGR was determined at 1.75 Å resolution. The overall structure of apo-PtGR monomer adopts the typical d-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase fold with a “closed” conformation unexpectedly.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was immobilized onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with the aid of Cu–Mg–Al calcined layered double hydroxide (CLDH). CLDH can provide a bigger effective surface area for AChE loading, which could improve the precision and stability of AChE biosensor. However, the poor electroconductibility of CLDHs could lead to the low sensitivity of AChE biosensor. In order to effectively compensate the disadvantages of CLDHs, graphene–gold nanocomposites were used for improving the electron transfer rate. Thus, the graphene–gold nanocomposite (GN-AuNPs) was firstly modified onto the GCE, and then the prepared CLDH-AChE composite was immobilized onto the modified GCE to construct a sensitive AChE biosensor for pesticides detection. Relevant parameters were studied in detail and optimized, including the pH of the acetylthiocholine chloride (ATCl) solution, the amount of AChE immobilized on the biosensor and the inhibition time governing the analytical performance of the biosensor. The biosensor detected chlorpyrifos at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 150 μg/L. The detection limit for chlorpyrifos was 0.05 μg/L.",

In this work, the distributions of water, biomass, and fermentation product in different medium depths of SSF were determined using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and the developed models. Based on the mass distribution regularity, the effects of gas double-dynamic on heat transfer, microbial growth and metabolism, and product distribution gradient were systematically investigated. Results indicated that the maximum temperature of substrate and the maximum carbon dioxide evolution rate (CER) were 39.5 °C and 2.48 mg/(h g) under static aeration solid-state fermentation (SASSF) and 33.9 °C and 5.38 mg/(h g) under gas double-dynamic solid-state fermentation (GDSSF), respectively, with the environmental temperature for fermentation of 30 ± 1 °C. The fermentation production (cellulase activity) ratios of the upper, middle, and lower levels were 1:0.90:0.78 at seventh day under SASSF and 1:0.95:0.89 at fifth day under GDSSF. Therefore, combined with NIRS analysis, gas double-dynamic could effectively strengthen the solid-state fermentation performance due to the enhancement of heat transfer, the stimulation of microbial metabolism and the increase of the homogeneity of fermentation products.",

This microorganism mainly produced 4-vinylphenol (4VP) from p-coumaric acid (p-CA). In the first study , we observed that the concentrations of 4VP are higher than 1 g/L which had a negative impact on decarboxylation of p-CA to 4VP by recombinant E. coli cells. Because of this, and in order to improve the downstream process, a two-phase aqueous-organic solvent system was developed. The results of the extractive fermentation indicated that it was possible to use hydrolyzates as aqueous phase to bioproduce 4VP, and recover simultaneously the product in the organic phase containing hexane. The detoxification of pre-treated corn cob alkaline hydrolyzate improved 4VP production up to 1003.5 mg/L after 24 h fermentation (QP = 41.813 mg/L h). Additionally, preliminary experiments using cells immobilized in calcium alginate showed to be a good system for the biotransform of p-CA to 4VP in extractive fermentation, although the process hindered partially the recovery of 4VP in the organic phase.",

     "abstract": "Lactobacillus coryniformis is known to produce d-lactic acid as a dominant fermentation product at a cultivation temperature of approximately 30 °C. However, the considerable production of l-lactic acid is observed when the fermentation temperature is greater than 40 °C. Because optically pure lactates are synthesized from pyruvate by the catalysis of chiral-specific d- or l-lactate dehydrogenase, the higher thermostability of l-LDHs is assumed to be one of the key factors decreasing the optical purity of d-lactic acid produced from L. coryniformis at high temperature. To verify this hypothesis, two types of d-ldh genes and six types of l-ldh genes based on the genomic information of L. coryniformis were synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli. Among the LDHs tested, five LDHs showed activity and were used to construct polyclonal antibodies. d-LDH1, l-LDH2, and l-LDH3 were found to be expressed in L. coryniformis by Western blotting analysis. The half-life values (t1/2) of the LDHs at 40 °C were estimated to be 10.50, 41.76, and 2311 min, and the T5010 values were 39.50, 39.90, and 58.60 °C, respectively. In addition, the Tm values were 36.0, 41.0, and 62.4 °C, respectively, which indicates that l-LDH has greater thermostability than d-LDH. The higher thermostability of l-LDHs compared with that of d-LDH1 may be a major reason why the enantiopurity of d-lactic acid is decreased at high fermentation temperatures. The key enzymes characterized will suggest a direction for the design of genetically modified lactic acid bacteria to produce optically pure d-lactic acid.",

To this end, α-linolenic acid (ALA) was biotransformed by the fungi Aspergillus niger into oxylipids with different levels of oxygenation within 24 h or 48 h.

     "abstract": "A novel electrochemical enzyme biosensor was developed for real-time detection of cellulase activity when acting on their natural insoluble substrate, cellulose. The enzyme biosensor was constructed with pyranose dehydrongease (PDH) from Agaricus meleagris that was immobilized on the surface of a carbon paste electrode, which contained the mediator 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP). An oxidation current of the reduced form of DCIP, DCIPH2, produced by the PDH-catalyzed reaction with either glucose or cellobiose, was recorded under constant-potential amperometry at +0.25 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The PDH-biosensor was shown to be anomer unspecific and it can therefore be used in kinetic studies over broad time-scales of both retaining- and inverting cellulases (in addition to enzyme cocktails). The biosensor was used for real-time measurements of the activity of the inverting cellobiohydrolase Cel6A from Hypocrea jecorina (HjCel6A) on cellulosic substrates with different morphology (bacterial microcrystalline cellulose (BMCC) and Avicel). The steady-state rate of hydrolysis increased towards a saturation plateau with increasing loads of substrate. The experimental results were rationalized using a steady-state rate equation for processive cellulases, and it was found that the turnover for HjCel6A at saturating substrate concentration (i.e. maximal apparent specific activity) was similar (0.39–0.40 s−1) for the two substrates. Conversely, the substrate load at half-saturation was much lower for BMCC compared to Avicel. Biosensors covered with a polycarbonate membrane showed high operational stability of several weeks with daily use.",

     "abstract": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its reduced form NADH are essential cofactors for many redox biocatalysts. Because these cofactors are consumed in stoichiometric amounts, whole-cell biocatalysts have been routinely employed in order to reduce the costs. To further improve the efficacy of redox biocatalysts, it is essential to maintain the stability of nicotinamide cofactors, for which it is attractive to block degradation pathways for NAD(H). While the biosynthesis of NAD(H) has been well studied, it is less understood how NAD(H) are degraded. Here we demonstrated that UshA was a major periplasmic enzyme for NAD degradation in Escherichia coli. Purified recombinant UshA showed high pyrophosphatase activity with the catalytic efficiencies for hydrolysis of NAD and NADH at 3.7 μM−1 s−1 and 1.4 μM−1 s−1, respectively. Deletion of the ushA gene from the chromosome led to faster cell growth and improved extracellular NAD stability by 3-fold under conditions similar to whole-cell biocatalysis. These results significantly enriched our understanding on NAD metabolism, and should facilitate many applications including designing more robust redox biocatalysts.",

     "abstract": "We previously described three α-l-arabinofuranosidases (ABFs) secreted by Penicillium chrysogenum 31B. Here, we purified a fourth ABF, termed PcABF43A, from the culture filtrate. The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated to be 31 kDa. PcABF43A had the highest activity at 35 °C and at around pH 5. The enzyme activity was strong on sugar beet l-arabinan but weak on debranched arabinan and arabinoxylan. Low molecular-mass substrates such as p-nitrophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside, α-1,5-l-arabinooligosaccharides, and branched arabinotriose were highly resistant to the action of PcABF43A. 1H-NMR analysis revealed that PcABF43A hydrolyzed arabinosyl side chains linked to C-2 or C-3 of single-substituted arabinose residues in l-arabinan. Reports concerning enzymes specific for l-arabinan are quite limited. Pcabf43A cDNA encoding PcABF43A was isolated by in vitro cloning. The deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme shows high similarities with the sequences of other fungal uncharacterized proteins. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that the Pcabf43A gene was constitutively expressed in P. chrysogenum 31B at a low level, although the expression was induced with pectic components such as l-arabinose, l-rhamnose, and d-galacturonic acid. Analysis of enzymatic characteristics of PcABF43A, GH51 ABF (AFQ1), and GH54 ABF (AFS1) from P. chrysogenum suggested that PcABF43A and AFS1 function as debranching enzymes and AFQ1 plays a role of saccharification in the degradation of l-arabinan by this fungus.",

     "abstract": "We have examined the chain length selectivity for a series of acyl donors by lipase B from Candida antarctica (CalB). CalB accepted aliphatic diesters of C4, C6 and C12 chain lengths equally. The introduction of a carbon–carbon double bond into the C4 esters dramatically lowered the rate constant associated with polymerization highlighting the role of geometry in catalysis; fumarate esters were polymerized at a reduced rate compared to the succinate esters, while the maleate esters were not polymerized above 5% over the course of 24 h. A disiloxane-containing diester impeded catalysis by CalB. We examined a series of vinyl siloxane esters and alcohols, and learned that the Z arrangement around the double bond stalled esterification by CalB completely. The distance between the ester carbonyl and the dimethylsiloxy group was shown to be an important factor in mediating catalysis. The rate constants were similar when the methylene spacer was 3, 4, or 5 units in length; beyond 6 methylene units, the rate constants increased. This has been tentatively attributed to the local reduction on the steric bulk when the larger siloxane moiety lies outside of the active site of the enzyme.",

Using a proteomic approach, the proteins excreted during fermentation were identified, and the influence of the chemical composition of the feathers on protein secretion was tested. The identified proteins are hydrolytic enzymes such as keratinase, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, chitosanases, and glicosidases. The diversity of proteins is related to the chemical complexity of the feathers. Understanding the composition of a hydrolytic system, when B. licheniformis is cultured on different feathers, may assist in utilizing such a system for producing different hydrolytic enzymes.

The experimental results and kinetic study showed that citronellyl acetate synthesis catalyzed by immobilized lipase BCL followed the ternary complex mechanism with inhibition by alcohol (citronellol). The energy of activation for citronellyl acetate synthesis was found to be lower for immobilized lipase (8.9 kcal/mol) than aggregated lipase (14.8 kcal/mol) enzyme.

In this study, a novel gene (glyt110) conferring β-galactosidase activity was obtained from a metagenomic library of Turpan Basin soil. Sequence analysis revealed that glyt110 encoded a protein of 369 amino acids that, rather than belonging to a family typically known for β-galactosidase activity, belonged to glycosyltransferase family 4. Because of this unusual sequence information, the novel gene glyt110 was subsequently expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and the recombinant enzyme (Glyt110) was purified and characterized. Biochemical characterization revealed that the β-galactosidase activity of Glyt110 toward o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) and lactose were identified to be 314 ± 18.3 and 32 ± 2.7 U/mg, correspondingly. In addition, Glyt110 can synthesize galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) using lactose as substrate. A GOS yield of 47.2% (w/w) was achieved from 30% lactose solution at 50 °С, pH 8.0 after 10 h reaction. However, Glyt110 was unable to glycosylate either N-acetylated saccharides or lactose and galactose using UDP-gal as sugar donor, and its glycosyltransferase activity needs further investigation. These results indicated that Glyt110 is an unusual enzyme with β-galactosidase activity but phylogenetically related to glycosyltransferase. Our findings may provide opportunities to improve the insight into the relationship between glycosyltransferases and glycoside hydrolases and the sequence-based classification.",

Furthermore, the l-arginine assay was developed by coupling arginine deiminase to the l-citrulline assay. Both assays exhibited high selectivity to l-citrulline and l-arginine without any significant reactivity to other proteinaceous amino acids. These assays were also resistant to various contaminants that interfered with the conventional l-citrulline and l-arginine assays. The high accuracy of these assays was demonstrated by measurements in the presence of human plasma. Because these assays can be conducted under the neutral pH without terminating the reaction progress, they allow not only measurements in static analyte solutions, but also real-time monitoring of l-citrulline and l-arginine synthesis in the reaction mixture.

Incubation of this strain with puerarin led to efficient production (91.6% conversation rate) of puerarin-7-O-fructoside, a derivative that possesses improved water solubility and antioxidant activity. A minor product puerarin-7-O-isomaltoside was also produced in small amounts, with a conversion rate of less than 1% after 48-h reaction. Both products were characterized based on the spectral data. Among the four tested sugars, sucrose (92.6% conversion rate of puerarin) is the best glycosyl donor for L. fusiformis CGMCC 4913, followed by maltose (39.8% conversion rate of puerarin), while glucose and fructose are not appropriate donors for this biotransformation process.

Replacement of two positively charged residues (K139 and K207) on the surface loops with neutral and reverse charges resulted in altered thermo stability in designed variants. Neutral charge substitutions (K139A and K207A) retained greater tolerance and stability followed by negative charge substitutions (K139D and K207D) compared to control mutant K139R and wild enzyme. From the results, it was concluded that the optimization of surface charge contributed much to the thermal properties of proteins without affecting the structure.",

     "abstract": "Pseudomonas sp. C27 is a facultative autotrophic bacterium (FAB) that can effectively conduct mixotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifying sulfide removal (DSR) reactions under anaerobic condition using organic matters and sulfide as electron donors. Micro-aeration was proposed to enhance DSR reaction by FAB; however, there is no experimental proof on the effects of micro-aeration on capacity of denitrifying sulfide removal of FAB on proteomic levels. The proteome in total C27 cell extracts was observed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Differentially expressed protein spots and specifically expressed protein spots were identified by MALDI TOF/TOF MS. We identified 55 microaerobic-responsive protein spots, representing 55 unique proteins. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that 75% of the proteins were up-regulated, and 5% of the proteins were specifically expressed under micro-aerobic conditions. These enzymes were mainly involved in membrane transport, protein folding and metabolism. The noted expression changes of the microaerobic-responsive proteins suggests that C27 strain has a highly efficient enzyme system to conduct DSR reactions under micro-aerobic condition. Additionally, micro-aeration can increase the rates of protein synthesis and cell growth, and enhance cell defensive system of the strain.",

The FTIR and UV–vis results inferred that HRP was not denatured during its immobilization on MT-MWCNT composite. The biosensing principle was based on the determination of the cathodic responses of the immobilized HRP to H2O2, before and after incubation in trace metal standard solutions. Under optimum conditions, the inhibition rates of trace metals were proportional to their concentrations in the range of 0.092–0.55 mg L−1, 0.068–2 mg L−1 for Pb2+ and Cu2+ respectively. The limits of detection were 2.5 μg L−1 for Pb2+ and 4.2 μg L−1 for Cu2+. Representative Dixon and Cornish-Bowden plots were used to deduce the mode of inhibition induced by the trace metal ions. The inhibition was reversible and mixed for both metal ions. Furthermore, the biosensor showed good stability, selectivity, repeatability and reproducibility.",

The purified ClER exhibited a relatively high activity of 7.3 U mgprot−1 for ketoisophorone while a remarkable catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km = 810 s−1 mM−1) was obtained for 2-methyl-cinnamaldehyde due to the high affinity. A series of prochiral activated alkenes were stereoselectively reduced by ClER furnishing the corresponding saturated products in up to 99% ee. The practical applicability of ClER was further evaluated for the production of (R)-levodione, a valuable chiral compound, from ketoisophorone. Using the crude enzyme of ClER and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), 500 mM of ketoisophorone was efficiently converted to (R)-levodione with excellent stereoselectivity (98% ee) within 1 h.

To enhance the synthesis of AqpZ in E. coli cell-free system, several natural leader peptides were respectively fused at the N-terminus and were verified to enhance the expression level significantly. Moreover, the supplementation of detergents or liposome could activate leader peptidase from the cell-free extract and provide hydrophobic environment for proper folding of AqpZ.

When bacteria were grown in large aerated bioreactors, biosurfactants mostly partitioned to the foam fraction, which was recovered. Dispersion effectiveness of surfactin and fatty acyl-glutamate was evaluated by measuring the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and dispersant-to-oil ratio (DOR).

However, CMC values were higher, 0.02 and 0.4 g/L for surfactin and fatty acyl-glutamate, respectively, in 12 parts per trillion (ppt) Instant Ocean® sea salt, which has been partly attributed to saline-induced conformational changes in the solvated ionic species of the biosurfactants.

In Instant Ocean® solutions containing 12 ppt sea salt, these decreased to 1:30 and 1:4, respectively, suggesting reduction in oil dispersing efficiency of both surfactants in saline. Surfactant toxicities were assessed using the Gulf killifish, Fundulus grandis, which is common in estuarine habitats of the Gulf of Mexico.

Systematic studies on the enzyme–surfactant system have been lacking as well as demonstration of its applicability to industrial wastewater. This paper addresses those two gaps, the latter based on real wastewater from alkyd resin manufacture. The minimum effective Triton X-100 concentrations for crude SBP-catalyzed phenol conversion (≥95%) over 1–10 mM showed a linear trend. To illustrate translation of such lab results to real-world samples, this data were used to optimize crude SBP needed for phenol conversion over that concentration range. Triton X-100 increases enzyme economy by 10- to 13-fold. This treatment protocol was directly applied to tote-scale (700–1000 L) treatment of alkyd resin wastewater, with phenol ranging from 7 to 28 mM and total organic carbon content of >40 g/L, using a crude SBP extract derived from dry soybean hulls by simple aqueous elution. This extract can be used to remove phenol from a complex industrial wastewater and the process is markedly more efficient in the presence of Triton X-100. The water is thus rendered amenable to conventional biological treatment whilst the hulls could still be used in feed, thus adding further value to the crop.",

Although in both cases, aniline monomer coupling occurred mainly via the carbon atom in para position of aniline, UV–vis–NIR absorption and EPR measurements indicate that the reaction with TvL/O2 yielded mainly overoxidized products (with λmax = 730 nm). These products had a lower amount of unpaired electrons if compared with the products obtained with HRPC/H2O2 (with λmax ≈ 1000 nm, which is characteristic for the polaron state of PANI-ES, the emeraldine salt form of PANI). Similarly to previous findings with HRPC/H2O2, enzyme inactivation occurred during the polymerization also in the case of TvL/O2. Since the aqueous PANI-vesicle suspensions obtained are of high colloidal stability, they can be used directly as ink in a conventional thermal inkjet printer for printing on paper or on surface treated polyimide films. Printed PANI-ES patterns on paper changed colour from green (emeraldine salt) to blue (emeraldine base) upon exposure to ammonia gas, demonstrating the expected ammonia sensing properties.",

Four different enzyme re-use methods were compared to optimize the biocatalytic productivity, i.e. 3′-sialyllactose formation per amount of Tr6 employed: (i) His-tag immobilization on magnetic Cu2+-iminodiacetic acid-functionalized nanoparticles (MNPs), (ii) membrane immobilization, (iii) calcium alginate encapsulation of cross-linked Tr6, and (iv) Tr6 catalysis in a membrane reactor. Tr6 immobilized on MNPs gave a biocatalytic productivity of 84 mg 3′-sialyllactose/mg Tr6 after seven consecutive reaction runs. Calcium-alginate and membrane immobilization were inefficient. Using free Tr6 in a 10 kDa membrane reactor produced a 9-fold biocatalytic productivity increase compared to using free Tr6 in a batch reactor giving 306 mg 3′-sialyllactose/mg Tr6 after seven consecutive reaction runs. The 3′-sialyllactose yield on α-2,3-bound sialic acid in CGMP was 74%. Using circular dichroism, a temperature denaturation midpoint of Tr6, Tm, of 57.2 °C was determined. The thermal stability of free Tr6 was similarly high and the Tr6 was stable at the reaction temperature (25 °C) for at least 24 h.",

In the present work, by using N-terminal of ice nucleation protein (INP) as anchoring motif, a genetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain surface displayed mutant organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) (S5) with improved enzyme activity was successfully constructed. The surface location of INP-OPH fusion was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis and enzyme activity assays. The OPH-displayed bacteria facilitate the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenol (PNP) substituted organophosphates to generate PNP, which can be detected spectrometrically at 410 nm. Over 90% of the recombinant protein present on the surface of microbes demonstrated enhanced enzyme activity and long-term stability. The OPH activity of whole cells was 2.16 U/OD600 using paraoxon as its substrate, which is the highest value reported so far. The optimal temperature for OPH activity was around 55 °C, and suspended cultures retained almost 100% of its activity over a period of one month at room temperature, exhibiting the better stability than free OPH. The recombinant E. coli strain could be employed as a whole-cell biocatalyst for detecting PNP substituted OPs at wider ranges and lower detection limits. Specifically, the linear ranges of the calibration curves were 0.5–150 μM paraoxon, 1–200 μM parathion and 2.5–200 μM methyl parathion, and limits of detection were 0.2 μM, 0.4 μM and 1 μM for paraoxon, parathion and methyl parathion, respectively (S/N = 3).

     "abstract": "Mandelate racemase (MR) is a promising candidate for the dynamic kinetic resolution of racemates. However, the poor activity of MR towards most of its non-natural substrates limits its widespread application. In this work, a virtual screening method based on the binding energy in the transition state was established to assist in the screening of MR mutants with enhanced catalytic efficiency. Using R-3-chloromandelic acid as a model substrate, a total of 53 mutants were constructed based on rational design in the two rounds of screening. The number of mutants for experimental validation was brought down to 17 by the virtual screening method, among which 14 variants turned out to possess improved catalytic efficiency. The variant V26I/Y54V showed 5.2-fold higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) towards R-3-chloromandelic acid than that observed for the wild-type enzyme. Using this strategy, mutants were successfully obtained for two other substrates, R-mandelamide and R-2-naphthylglycolate (V26I and V29L, respectively), both with a 2-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency. These results demonstrated that this method could effectively predict the trend of mutational effects on catalysis. Analysis from the energetic and structural assays indicated that the enhanced interactions between the active sites and the substrate in the transition state led to improved catalytic efficiency. It was concluded that this virtual screening method based on the binding energy in the transition state was beneficial in enzyme rational redesign and helped to better understand the catalytic properties of the enzyme.",

Three immobilized lipases were tested and the best KMR yields were attained with Lipozyme TL IM and Novozym 435. Since Lipozyme TL IM is the cheapest, it was selected to optimize the reaction conditions. The optimal reaction conditions were 80 °C for the temperature, 1:1 for the alcohol/acid molar ratio, 600 rpm for stirring speed and 7.8% for the catalyst concentration. Under these conditions, the reaction was scaled up in a 5 × 10−3 m3 stirred tank reactor. 1H–13C HMBC-NMR showed that the primary hydroxyl group of kojic acid was regioselectively esterified. The KMR has more lipophilicity than kojic acid and showed antioxidant activity that improves the oxidation stability of biodiesel.",

     "abstract": "Increasing the production of fatty acids by microbial fermentation remains an important step toward the generation of biodiesel and other portable liquid fuels. In this work, we report an Escherichia coli strain engineered to overexpress a fragment consisting of four dehydratase domains from the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthase enzyme complex from the deep-sea bacterium, Photobacterium profundum. The DH1-DH2-UMA enzyme fragment was excised from its natural context within a multi-enzyme PKS and expressed as a stand-alone protein. Fatty acids were extracted from the cell pellet, esterified with methanol and quantified by GC-MS analysis. Results show that the E. coli strain expressing the DH tetradomain fragment was capable of producing up to a 5-fold increase (80.31 mg total FA/L culture) in total fatty acids over the negative control strain lacking the recombinant enzyme. The enhancement in production was observed across the board for all the fatty acids that are typically made by E. coli. The overexpression of the DH tetradomain did not affect E. coli cell growth, thus showing that the observed enhancement in fatty acid production was not a result of effects associated with cell density. The observed enhancement was more pronounced at lower temperatures (3.8-fold at 16 °C, 3.5-fold at 22 °C and 1.5-fold at 30 °C) and supplementation of the media with 0.4% glycerol did not result in an increase in fatty acid production. All these results taken together suggest that either the dehydration of fatty acid intermediates are a limiting step in the E. coli fatty acid biosynthesis machinery, or that the recombinant dehydratase domains used in this study are also capable of catalyzing thioester hydrolysis of the final products. The enzyme in this report is a new tool which could be incorporated into other existing strategies aimed at improving fatty acid production in bacterial fermentations toward accessible biodiesel precursors.",

In this study, we isolated two candidate genes with resveratrol O-methyltransferase (ROMT) activity from grape (Vitis riparia) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). To assess their ROMT activities in vivo, we synthesized VrROMT and SbROMT3 following codon-optimization and expressed the VrROMTsyn and SbROMT3syn genes using a dual expression vector system. Furthermore, we attempted to produce pterostilbene from resveratrol as a substrate by the expression of two putative ROMT proteins in Escherichia coli. Unexpectedly, expression of the SbROMT3syn gene in E. coli led to the production of mono-methylated stilbene (3,4′-dihydroxy-5-methoxy-trans-stilbene, pinostilbene) from resveratrol compounds. However, a very small amount of di-methylated stilbene (3,5-dimethoxy-4′-hydroxy-trans-stilbene, pterostilbene) was also detected. Consistently, we found that in vitro methylation assays of resveratrol by recombinant SbROMT3syn produced pinostilbene as the major product besides a very small amount of pterostilbene. By contrast, very small amounts of methylated resveratrol derivatives were detected in E. coli expressing the VrROMTsyn protein. This suggests that the SbROMT3syn is more useful in the production of pinostilbene compounds than pterostilbene from resveratrol in E. coli.",

The stability of the immobilized molecules was examined using reaction rate as a function of temperature and was shown to be significantly higher on the PIII treated beads compared to untreated beads. We attribute the increased enzyme activity on PIII treated beads to increased protein binding density and better retention of conformation. The results of this work are of significance in the production of ethanol using a flow process. Covalent binding to beads allows more robust attachment for high flow rates, high activity, large surface area and a broad operating pH range. Treatment could be easily adapted for a range of applications such as linking drugs, dyes and proteins to particles of an appropriate size.",

     "abstract": "The Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase (PAE), produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), is a promising biocatalyst for peptide synthesis in organic solvents. As P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen, the enzyme has been heterologously over-expressed in the safe and efficient host, Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) for its industrial application. The recombinant elastase (rPAE) contains three potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr consensus sequences), and is heterogeneously N-glycosylated. To investigate the role of N-glycosylation in the activity, stability, and expression of rPAE, these potential N-glycosylation sites (N43, N212, and N280) were mutated using site-directed mutagenesis. Specifically the asparagine (Asn, N) residues were converted to glutamine (Gln, Q). The enzymatic activity and stability of non-glycosylated and glycosylated rPAE were then compared. The results indicated that the influence of N-glycosylation on its activity was insignificant. The non- and glycosylated isoforms of rPAE displayed similar kinetic parameters for hydrolyzing casein in aqueous medium, and when catalyzing bipeptide synthesis in 50% (v/v) DMSO, they exhibited identical substrate specificity and activity, and produced similar yields. However, N-glycosylation improved rPAE stability both in aqueous medium and in 50% (v/v) organic solvents. The half-lives of the glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms of rPAE at 70 °C were 32.2 and 23.1 min, respectively. Mutation of any potential N-glycosylation site was detrimental to its expression in P. pastoris. There was a 23.9% decrease in expression of the N43Q mutant, 63.6% of the N212Q mutant, and 63.7% of the N280Q mutant compared with the wild type. Furthermore, combined mutation of these sites resulted in an additional decrease in the caseinolytic activities of the mutants. These results indicated that all of the N-glycosylation sites were necessary for high-level expression of rPAE.",

Enzymes immobilized on solid carriers are particularly suited for such applications. In this study, the organophosphate degrading enzyme A (OpdA) was covalently immobilized on highly porous nonwoven polyester fabrics for organophosphate pesticide degradation. The fabrics were first activated with ethylenediamine to introduce free amine groups, and the enzyme was then attached using the bifunctional crosslinker glutaraldehyde. The immobilization only slightly increased the Km (for methyl parathion, MP), broadened the pH profile such that the enzyme had significant activity at acidic pH, and enhanced the stability of the enzyme. The OpdA-functionalized fabrics could be stored in a phosphate buffer or in the dry state at 4 °C for at least 4 weeks without a large loss of activity. When used in batch mode, the functionalized textiles could degrade 20 μM MP in un-buffered water at liquor to fabric ratios as high as 5000:1 within 2 h, and could be used repeatedly. The fabrics could also be made into columns for continuous pesticide degradation. The columns were able to degrade 50 μM MP at high flow rates, and could be used repeatedly over 2 months. These results demonstrate that OpdA immobilized on nonwoven polyester fabrics is useful in environmental remediation of organophosphate compounds.",

To maximize its therapeutic efficiency as protection against in vivo proteolysis, reduction of antigenicity and hyperammoniemia, the enzyme was PEGylated and coupled with glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). The highest degree of PEGylation was measured at 40–50/1 molar ratio of PEG to AfMETase, with a lower mobility on SDS-PGE, compared to the native AfMETase. The activity of free AfMETase was reduced to 66.2% and further to 50% upon PEGylation and GDH conjugation, respectively.

Nevertheless, H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species are capable of inducing damage to DNA and other cellular components, and oxidative stress caused by overproduction of cellular oxidants has been linked to pathologies such as inflammatory diseases and cancer. Therefore, new approaches for reducing the accumulation of cellular oxidants are of considerable interest from both a biotechnological and a therapeutic perspective. Recognizing that selenium is an essential component of the active sites of several antioxidant enzymes, we have developed a family of novel phenylaminoethyl selenide compounds that are readily taken up into cells and have low toxicity in vivo. We now report chemiluminescent imaging of hydrogen peroxide consumption by phenylaminoethyl selenides, via the use of peroxalate nanoparticle methodology. Further, we demonstrate the ability of phenylaminoethyl selenides to decrease lipopolysaccharide-induced oxidative stress in human embryonic kidney cells. We also report the successful encapsulation of a phenylaminoethyl selenide within poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles, and we show that these selenide-loaded nanoparticles exhibit antioxidant activity in cells. Taken together, these results significantly enhance the attractiveness of phenylaminoethyl selenides as potential agents for supplementing cellular defenses against reactive oxygen species.",

Only G. lucidum was able to grow vividly on malt extract or minimal media supplemented with alkali lignin. When grown on malt extract or minimal medium supplemented with lignocellulose (sugar cane bagasse), the crude G. lucidum protein extract exhibited high laccase activity, ∼3 U/mL toward syringaldazine. This activity was 13–17 fold higher than the corresponding activities of the crude protein extracts of P. brumalis, P. ciliatus and T. versicolor. Native PAGE electrophoresis of the crude G. lucidum extract confirmed the presence of an active laccase. The G. lucidum laccase had a molecular weight of ∼62.5 kDa, and a Km value of 0.107 mM (determined on ABTS). A partial amino acid sequence analysis of four short de novo sequenced peptides, defined after trypsin digest analysis using MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysis, revealed 64–100% homology to sequences in related laccases in the UniProt database, but also indicated that certain sequence stretches had low homology. Addition of the laccase-rich G. lucidum broth to lignocellulosic biomass (pretreated sugar cane bagasse) together with a state-of-the-art cellulase enzyme preparation (Cellic™CTec1) produced significantly increased cellulolytic yields, which were also better than those obtained with a T. versicolor laccase addition, indicating that the laccase from G. lucidum has unique properties that may be momentous in lignocellulosic biomass conversion.",

However, these assays require extraction procedures and special instruments. Here, we developed a specific colorimetric microplate assay for testing MsrA activity quickly, which was based on the fact that MsrA can catalyze the reduction of methyl sulfoxides and simultaneously oxidize dithiothreitol (DTT), whose color can be produced by reacting with Ellman's reagent (dithio-bis-nitrobenzoic acid, DTNB). The corresponding absorbance change at 412 nm was recorded with a microplate reader as the reaction proceeded. This method to monitor MsrA activity is easy to handle.

The carbohydrate content of the purified enzymes was 9.2%. In this work, the cellobiose dehydrogenase gene cdh1 and its corresponding cDNA from fungus P. sanguineus were isolated, cloned, and characterized. The 2310 bp full-length cDNA of cdh1 encoded a mature CDH protein containing 769 amino acids, which was preceded by a signal peptide of 19 amino acids. Moreover, both active fractions were characterized in terms of kinetics, temperature and pH optima, and antioxidant properties.",

Regarding the effect of gene dosage, the enzyme activity for recombinant strain with three copies lipase gene was 1.95-fold higher than that for recombinant strain with only one copy lipase gene. In addition, the lipase production was further improved by co-expression with chaperone PDI involved in the disulfide bond formation in the ER. Overall, the maximum enzyme activity reached 355 U/mL by the recombinant strain with one copy chaperone gene PDI plus five copies lipase gene proRCL in shaking flasks, which was 2.74-fold higher than that for the control strain with only one copy lipase gene.

This study examined the oxidative destruction of a sulfur mustard by the enzyme chloroperoxidase (EC 1.11.1.10). Chloroperoxidase (CPO) belongs to a group of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of various organic compounds by peroxide in the presence of a halide ion. The enzymatic oxidation reaction is affected by several factors: pH, presence or absence of chloride ion, temperature, the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and enzyme and aqueous solubility of the substrate. The optimum reaction conditions were determined by analyzing the effects of all factors, and the following conditions were selected: solvent, Britton–Robinson buffer (pH = 3) with tert-butanol (70:30 v/v); CPO concentration, 16 U/mL; hydrogen peroxide concentration, 40 mmol/L; sodium chloride concentration, 20 mmol/L. Under these reaction conditions, the rate constant for the reaction is 0.006 s−1. The Michaelis constant, a measure of the affinity of an enzyme for a particular substrate, is 1.87 × 10−3 M for this system. The Michaelis constant for enzymes with a high affinity for their substrate is in the range of 10−5 to 10−4 M, so this value indicates that CPO does not have a very high affinity for sulfur mustard.",

In spite of that the proliferative capacity and multipotency of stem cells are dependent on the type and age of the source tissue, however, the effect of the cell senescence on the impedance measurement of stem cells has not yet been studied. We investigated whether the senescence of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) can be detected by electrical impedance spectroscopy. For this, ADSCs at passage 9 and 31 were prepared and those genetic characteristics and growth kinetics were evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and cell counting. While the identified ADSCs were grown on the indium tin oxide electrodes, the impedance spectra were measured and interpreted by fitting analysis with an equivalent circuit model. ADSCs at passage 9 adhered on the electrode were small and spindle-shaped whereas the cells at passage 31 were flattened and larger than younger cells. At the beginning of culture time when the cell adhesion occurred, the resistance at 4.6 kHz of passage 31 cells was higher than passage 9 due to the larger size of older cells. Afterwards, the value of passage 9 cells increased higher than passage 31, since younger cells proliferated more than old cells. Therefore, the impedance measurement could characterize the proliferative capacity of ADSCs during expanded culture.",

Therefore, understanding of enzyme–lignin interactions is essential for the development of enzyme mixtures and processes for lignocellulose hydrolysis. We have studied cellulase–lignin interactions using model enzymes, Melanocarpus albomyces Cel45A endoglucanase (MaCel45A) and its fusions with native and mutated carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) from Trichoderma reesei Cel7A. Binding of MaCel45A to lignin was dependent on pH in the presence and absence of the CBM; at high pH, less enzyme bound to isolated lignins. Potentiometric titration of the lignin preparations showed that negatively charged groups were present in the lignin samples and that negative charge in the samples was increased with increasing pH. The results suggest that electrostatic interactions contributed to non-productive enzyme adsorption: Reduced enzyme binding at high pH was presumably due to repulsive electrostatic interactions between the enzymes and lignin. The CBM increased binding of MaCel45A to the isolated lignins only at high pH. Hydrophobic interactions are probably involved in CBM binding to lignin, because the same aromatic amino acids that are essential in CBM–cellulose interaction were also shown to contribute to lignin-binding.",

Bio-ethanol production was conducted in batches using WBFB supernatant in the first phase at 25–67 °C and 50 rpm, followed by the addition of 3% WBFB solid residue to the existing culture broth in the second phase at 67 °C. The ethanol production increased from 50 to 102.5 g/L when bare supernatant was used in the first phase, and then to 219 g ethanol/L in the second phase. The amount of ethanol obtained using this strategy was almost equal to that obtained using the original WBFB containing 25% solid residue at 33 °C, and more than double that obtained when bare supernatant was used. Microscopic and gel electrophoresis studies revealed yeast cell wall degradation and secretion of cellular material into the surrounding medium.

It is cited from the literature that the organism is deficient in some sugar or polysaccharide processing enzymes and thus is tested for its ability to utilize substrates mainly rich in protein components like beef extract and with successive production of electricity. The particular species has been found to generate a maximum power density of 85 mW/m2 and current density of ≈270 mA/m2 using graphite felt as electrode. The maximum Open Circuit Voltage and current has been noted as 0.7 Vand 0.8 mA during these operational cycles. Cyclic voltammetry studies indicate the presence of some electroactive compounds which can facilitate electron transfer from bacteria to electrode. The number of electrogens able to generate electricity in mediator free conditions are few, and the study introduces more divergence to that population. Substrate specificity and electricity generation efficacy of the strain in treating wastewater, specially rich in protein content has been reported in the study. As the species has been found to be efficient in utilizing proteinaceous material, the technique can be useful to treat specific type of wastewaters like wastewater from slaughterhouses or from meat packaging industry. Treating them in a more economical way which generates electricity as a outcome must be preferred over the conventional aerobic treatments.

These enzymes are part of an enzymatic cocktail that is commercialized under the name RovabioExcel®, which is used as feed additive in animal nutrition. The genome sequence of this filamentous fungus has revealed a remarkable richness in several accessory enzymes, and notably in α-l-arabinofuranosidases (α-l-AFases) that participate in the hydrolysis of arabinoxylans (AX) in corn/wheat fibers used in poultry feed. Here, we report on the molecular and biochemical characterization of three GH62 family α-l-AFases encoding genes in this filamentous fungus. Amino acids sequences showed strong similarities (>65%) between them, as well with GH62 enzymes from other filamentous fungi. Interestingly, one of the three PfABF62, namely PfABF62c is unique in bearing at its N-terminus a canonical family 1 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM1) of 37 amino acids length, which was shown to help the protein to bind to microcrystalline cellulose. Also, this PfABF62c showed optimal pH and temperature of 2.8 and 50 °C, respectively, whereas optimal activity for PfABF62a and PfABF62b were measured at 40 °C and at pH ranging between 2.6 and 4.5. Arabinan and arabinoxylan, but no other sugars or polymers were found to augment the thermal transition of the three enzymes by 3–5 °C as measured by differential scanning fluorimetry. Finally, enzymatic hydrolysis fingerprints of heteroxylans allowed concluding that the mode of action of the GH62 enzymes from this fungal species was to remove arabinofuranosyl residues linked in position O-2 and O-3 of substituted xylose units in arabinoxylan chains.",

Two distinct strains were used, namely conventional yeast (exemplified by Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and a non-conventional strain (exemplified by Debaryomyces occidentalis). The encapsulation of the yeast cells was performed by the traditional process of droplet formation, but from a foamed alginate solution. The activities of two key enzymes, succinate dehydrogenase and pyruvate decarboxylase, together with the ATP content were measured in both the free and immobilized cells. This novel method of yeast cell entrapment had some notable effects. The number of living immobilized cells reached the level of 106–107 per single bead, and was stable during the fermentation process. Reductions in both enzyme activity and ATP content were observed in all immobilized yeasts. However, S. cerevisiae showed higher levels of ATP and enzymatic activity than D. occidentalis. Fermentation trials with immobilized repitching cells showed that the tested yeasts adapted to the specific conditions. Nevertheless, the mechanical endurance of the carriers and the internal structure of the gel need to be improved to enable broad applications of alginate gels in industrial fermentation processes, especially with conventional yeasts.

With the absence of an available bacterial AHAS crystal structure, that of M. tuberculosis, site-directed mutagenesis has been a useful tool for determining its structural and functional features. In this study, a highly conserved proline residue (P126 of M. tuberculosis AHAS) was selected, and the possible role was evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis. P126 was replaced by valine, threonine, alanine, and glutamate to yield P126V, P126T, P126A, and P126E, respectively. All variants were expressed in their soluble forms in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity. The molecular mass (SDS-PAGE) of the purified variants was ∼68 kDa, which is similar to that of wild-type AHAS. The P126V, P126T, and P126A variants exhibited significantly lower activity than wild-type AHAS, whereas P126E was inactive under the tested assay conditions. Furthermore, the P126V and P126T variants showed a significantly decreased preference toward pyruvate and ThDP as substrate and cofactor respectively, whereas the P126A showed similar kinetics to that of wild-type AHAS. Like in AHAS from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PDB ID: 1N0H), residue P126 is located in the ThDP binding pocket of M. tuberculosis AHAS homology model.

From the morphological and compositional analyses, untreated SCB has relatively more structural changes with a higher percentage of depolymerisation on the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin content compared to alkali-pretreated SCB. Thus, untreated SCB favoured the production of cellulase and fungal biomass whereas alkali-pretreated SCB yielded a higher amount of RS. The composition and morphology of untreated SCB did not encourage RS production and this suggested that RS produced during SSF might be consumed in a faster rate by the more abundantly grown fungus.

A high oxidative activity of the receptor element and the absence of any toxic effect of assayed compounds were shown for 34 substrates (alcohols, carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, amino acids, nitrophenols and surfactants) that may occur in wastewaters. Estimates of the measurement range and region of the linear dependence of signals on the BOD level, pH and temperature sensitivities, dependences of signals on concentrations of salts, stability, Michaelis kinetic constants and assay rates were obtained. The BOD values determined by the biosensor in assayed wastewater samples were shown to have a high correlation with those obtained by the standard dilution method.",

Mesoporous silica modified with n-octyl groups was used as a reference support. Irreversible transesterifications of three vinyl esters (acyl donors) by racemic Solketal with a chromatographically (GC) traced kinetics were selected as model reactions. The undertaken comparative studies revealed that different morphology and chemical functionalisation of the supports led to various enzyme loadings, catalytic activities and enantioselectivities. MWCNT–lipase emerged as the exceptionally active (yield up to 98%, t = 1 h, 1320 U g−1, i.e. 9 times more active than native enzyme) whereas lipase immobilised on O-MWCNTs as the most enantioselective system, particularly for longer acyl chain esters (e.e. up to 72% after 30 min at yield of 20%, 340 U g−1). Moreover, the activity of all nanotube-based catalysts after 10 cycles of transesterification remained practically unchanged. The differences in performance of MWCNTs and O-MWCNTs as solid supports were found to be based on geometry of pores, dominating hydrophobic interactions and absence/presence of the surface polar groups. Due to an excellent activity and reusability of the nanotube–lipase catalysts one can propose (O-)MWCNT as supports of a prospective industrial relevance.",

In particular, cadmium and several cadmium-containing compounds are carcinogens and induce many types of cancer. Biological extracts of cadmium have been given greater attention recently because they are considered to be environmentally benign and economically acceptable. Among promising candidates, one emerging technology is the use of tunable, metal-binding biopolymers based on elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs). An ELP consists of the repeating pentapeptide of specific amino acids, Val-Pro-Gly-Xaa-Gly (where the “guest residue” Xaa is any amino except proline) that undergoes a reversible phase transition at a specific temperature (transition temperature, Tt). However, the ELP itself is relatively non-selective. A biopolymer with metal-binding domains that have stronger affinity, capacity, and selectivity would have distinct advantages. We investigated the use of a new generation of ELP biopolymers, EC18-ELP containing synthetic phytochelatin (EC), which is a metal-binding protein with a repetitive motif (Glu-Cys)nGly, as the metal-binding domain. In this study, an EC18-ELP fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and the metal binding ability of EC to cadmium was examined quantitatively.

This yielded the buffer- and salt-free synthesis of GABA conveniently in a batch mode. Furthermore, we engineered GAD to hyper active ones by extending or reducing the length of the enzyme by just one residue at its C-terminus.

Plant cells are traditionally maintained by repeated subcultures. However, this method has several problems including genetic instability of transformed cell lines, time- and cost-consuming. In this study, long-term cryopreserved rice suspension cells were firstly investigated for the production of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4-immunoglobulin (hCTLA4Ig). The cryopreserved cells for 5 years were regrowed to callus successfully and then suspended into the liquid medium. Consequently, the maximum cell mass and the hCTLA4Ig production were similar levels compared to those of the non-cryopreserved cells (control) even though hCTLA4Ig productivity was 1.7-fold higher than that of control. To further assess the level of improvements in hCTLA4Ig productivity in cryopreserved cells, hCTLA4Ig production profiles were statistically assessed between data of the cryopreserved cells for 5 years and annual data of non-cryopreserved cells maintained by subculture for 5 years. These results also indicate that hCTLA4Ig productivity in cryopreserved cells for 5 years was significantly increased (p-value: <0.001, 95% confidence interval) and it could be related to cell lysis resulting in release of hCTLA4Ig which was confirmed by the measurement of electrolyte leakage. In conclusion, we show that the long-term cryopreservation of transgenic rice cells was possible to support stable cell lines for the production of PMPs.",

     "abstract": "A general strategy was demonstrated here to immobilize proteins with various isoelectric points (IPs) in layered titanates. The immobilization of proteins with relative low IPs, such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lipase, in layered titanates was successfully by a novel polyelectrolyte-assisted electrostatic self-assembly technique, which is impossible by a conventional electrostatic self-assembly method. Lysozyme with relative high IP was detractively interacted with negative titanate nanosheets to form a bioinorganic composite. The native structures of proteins were retained after immobilizing although a significant difference in microstructures was observed among these composites. The amounts of immobilized proteins were up to ∼68.3 wt.% for lysozyme, 37.2 wt.% for BSA and 21.5 wt.% for lipase. These composites were stable in the neutral and weakly acidic condition, and only releases <10% proteins in the pH < 4 solution. The immobilized lysozyme and lipase exhibit excellent thermal stability, which retain their initial activities of about 70% at 70 °C for about 40 min. In addition, these composites are reusable, and the residual activities of immobilized enzymes are 68% for lysozyme and 61% for lipase after 10 recycles.",

In cultures at low DOT (1%), in which a high molecular weight alginate (1200 kDa) was synthesized, the transcription levels of alg8 and alg44 (genes encoding alginate polymerase complex), and algX (encoding a protein involved in polymer transport through periplasmic space) were considerably higher as compared to cultures conducted at 5% DOT, under which an alginate with a low MW (42 kDa) was produced. In the case of genes encoding for intracellular and extracellular alginases, the levels of these transcripts were higher at 1% DOT.

For this application, several bacteria and fungi have been employed and genetically modified. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are gaining recognition as novel producers of useful compounds by metabolic engineering. Among LAB, Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB 8826 is an interesting candidate for succinic acid production by metabolic engineering since it has an incomplete tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and naturally produces small amounts of succinic acid. In this study, we constructed recombinant LAB and evaluated them as hosts of succinic acid production. We examined the enzymes pyruvate carboxylase (PC), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and malic enzyme for their potential to improve metabolic flux from glycolysis to the reductive TCA cycle in a lactate dehydrogenase-deficient strain of L. plantarum NCIMB 8826 (VL103). We investigated the effects of overexpression or coexpression of each enzyme on succinic acid production. Our results suggested that PC is the key enzyme for succinic acid production by L. plantarum VL103, whereas PEPCK is critical for increasing biomass. The highest yield of succinic acid was obtained through coexpression of PC and PEPCK in L. plantarum VL103. This recombinant strain produced a 22-fold higher amount of succinic acid than the wild-type and converted 25.3% of glucose to succinic acid.",

Silencing of cre1 resulted in derepression of cellulase gene expression in glucose-based cultivation. The cre1 interference strain C313 produced 2.1-, 1.4-, 0.8-, and 0.8-fold higher amounts of filter paper activity, β-1,4-exoglucanase activity (ρ-nitrophenyl-β-d-cellobioside as substrate), β-1,4-endoglucanase activity (sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as substrate), and xylanase activity, respectively, than the control strain, suggesting that silencing of cre1 resulted in enhanced enzyme production capability. In addition, downregulation of cre1 resulted in elevated expression of another regulator of xylanase and cellulase expression, xyr1, indicating that CREI also acted as a repressor of xyr1 transcription in T. koningii under inducing conditions. These results show that RNAi is a feasible method for analyzing the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression and improving xylanase and cellulase productivity in T. koningii.",

But generally, most compressed treatments significantly enhanced PCL esterification activity. Conformational analysis by FT-IR and fluorescence emission spectra revealed that enhanced activities after supercritical CO2 treatment were correlated with the secondary and tertiary structural changes of PCL. Secondary structure changes also appeared to be responsible for enhancement of PCL activities by subcritical CO2 treatment. Compared to native PCL, treated PCL's esterification activity significantly decreased in hydrophilic organic media, while transesterification activity significantly increased in tert-amyl alcohol and acetone. After supercritical treatment, the thermal stability of PCL significantly decreased in esterification reactions, however, there was no significant difference in transesterification reactions.",

To estimate how much PCK-mediated phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylation is contributed to the ATP increase under engineered conditions, the kinetics of PEP carboxylation by PCK and substrate competing phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PPC) were measured using recombinant enzymes. The PEP carboxylation catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the recombinant PCK was 660 mM−1 min−1, whereas that of the recombinant PPC was 1500 mM−1 min−1. Under the presence of known allosteric effectors (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, acetyl-CoA, ATP, malate, and aspartate) close to in vivo conditions, the catalytic efficiency of PCK-mediated PEP carboxylation (84 mM−1 min−1) was 28-folds lower than that of PPC (2370 mM−1 min−1). To verify the above results, an E. coli strain expressing native PCK and PPC under control of identical promoter was constructed by replacing PCK promoter region with that of PPC in chromosome. The native PCK activity (33 nmol/mg-protein min) was 5-folds lower than PPC activity (160 nmol/mg-protein min) in the cell extract from the promoter-exchanged strain.

One of the most representative microorganisms in this scenario is the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which alone is responsible for ca. 13–15% of all nosocomial infections. Bacteriophages have been reported as a potentially useful tool in the diagnosis of bacterial diseases, since they specifically recognize and lyse bacterial isolates thus confirming the presence of viable cells. In the present research effort, immobilization of these biological (although metabolically inert) entities was achieved via entrapment within (optimized) porous (bio)polymeric matrices of alginate and agar, aiming at their full structural and functional stabilization. Such phage-impregnated polymeric matrices are intended for future use as chromogenic hydrogels sensitive to color changes evolving from reaction with (released) intracytoplasmatic moieties, as a detection kit for P. aeruginosa cells.",

Correct PCR primer design as well as a variety of factors that increase transformation efficiency were critical contributors to the method's overall success. We also developed a quantitative analysis of library quality (Q-values) that defines library degeneracy. Q-values can be calculated from standard fluorescence sequencing data (capillary electropherograms) and the degeneracy predicted from an early stage of library construction (pooled plasmids from the initial transformation) closely matched that observed after ca. 1000 library members were sequenced. Based on this experience, we suggest that this analysis can be a useful guide when applying our optimized protocol to new systems, allowing one to focus only on good-quality libraries and reject substandard libraries at an early stage. This advantage is particularly important when lower-throughput screening techniques such as chiral-phase GC must be employed to identify protein variants with desirable properties, e.g., altered stereoselectivities or when multiple codons are targeted for simultaneous randomization.",

In this work, the effect of controlled RP and DOT on the refolding of E. coli alkaline phosphatase (AP) and chicken lysozyme (CL) enzymes were studied. Disulphide bonds of both enzymes were reduced in an instrumented vessel using 2-mercaptoethanol and nitrogen. In the latter case, guanidine hydrochloride was also used to denature the protein. Such conditions caused protein conformational changes, as determined by the intrinsic fluorescence spectra that correlated with a decrease on the activity in both cases. Reduced enzymes were then oxidized, under different constant and predetermined RP or DOT, by manipulating the gas composition in the vessel. Folding kinetics were followed as the recovery of enzyme activity. Results showed that the percentage of recovery and rate of increase of enzymatic activity directly depended on the RP and DOT. A higher folding efficiency was found under controlled DOT compared to controlled RP conditions. These results are useful for establishing protein folding strategies to improve the recovery of active protein from inclusion bodies.",

The lipase-hydrolytic activity of the immobilized A. oryzae (r-BTL) was highest at 50 °C and was maintained even after an incubation of 24-h at 60 °C. In addition, r-BTL was highly tolerant to 30% (v/v) organic solvents (dimethyl carbonate, ethanol, methanol, 2-propanol or acetone). The attractive characteristics of r-BTL also worked efficiently on palm oil methanolysis, resulting in a nearly 100% conversion at elevated temperature from 40 to 50 °C. Moreover, r-BTL catalyzed methanolysis at a high methanol concentration without a significant loss of lipase activity. In particular, when 2 molar equivalents of methanol were added 2 times, a methyl ester content of more than 90% was achieved; the yield was higher than those of conventional whole-cell biocatalyst and commercial Candida antarctica lipase (Novozym 435). On the basis of the results regarding the excellent lipase characteristics and efficient biodiesel production, the developed whole-cell biocatalyst would be a promising biocatalyst in a broad range of applications including biodiesel production.",

     "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the influence of crosslinkers on the operational and heat stability of immobilized enzymes on a silanized silicon surface. To this end, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), a model multimeric enzyme, was attached through bifunctional crosslinkers able to bind covalently the −NH2 in the silane layer and of amine residues in the enzyme. Five bifunctional crosslinkers in the form of “X-spacer-X” were used, differing by the reactive functional groups (X = aldehyde: −CHO, isothiocyanate: −NCS, isocyanate: −NCO), by the nature of the spacer chain (aromatic or aliphatic) or by the geometry (bifunctional groups positioned in meta- or para- on an aromatic ring). A thermostability enhancement has been obtained for enzymes immobilized using 1,4-phenylene diisothiocyanate (PDC) and 1,4-phenylene diisocyanate (DIC). Moreover, using the latter crosslinker, activity was the mostly preserved upon successive uses, thus giving the best operational stability achieved. Changing the geometry of the cross-linker, i.e., 1,4- as compared to 1,3-phenylene diisothiocyanate (PDC and MDC, respectively), has a crucial effect on operational and thermal stabilities. Indeed, among all used crosslinkers, the most important loss was observed for MDC (residual activity after 6 times use is ~16%). Using dialdehyde crosslinkers: glutaraldehyde (GA) and terephtalaldehyde (TE), activity was significantly less well preserved than with DIC and PDC (for GA and TE, a loss of about 50% at 30 °C against no loss for PDC and DIC).These effects can be explained by a multipoint attachment model, in which a higher number of anchoring points stabilizes the three-dimensional structure and especially the binding of the two subunits in the active dimer, at the expense of a greater rigidity which is detrimental to the absolute activity. The differences observed with the crosslinkers are mainly due to steric hindrance at the interface which seems to be greatly influenced by the structure and the reactivity of the linkers.",

Longer linear alkenes with a terminal double bond (e.g. 1-octene) and cyclic alkenes (e.g. cyclohexene) were converted into the corresponding epoxides and allylic hydroxylation products; oxidation of the cyclic monoterpene limonene yielded three oxygenation products (two epoxides and an alcohol).

One drawback of this enzyme is its limited substrate specificity. For instance, l-lactate dehydrogenase exhibits no detectable activity towards the large side chain of 2-hydroxy acid l-mandelic acid, an α-hydroxy acid with anti-bacterial activity. Despite many attempts to engineer bsLDH to accept α-hydroxy acid substrates, there have been no attempts to introduce the industrially important l-mandelic acid to bsLDH. Herein, we describe attempts to change the reactivity of bsLDH towards l-mandelic acid. Using the Insight II molecular modelling programme (except ‘program’ in computers) and protein engineering techniques, we have successfully introduced substantial mandelate dehydrogenase activity to the enzyme. Energy minimisation modelling studies suggested that two mutations, T246G and I240A, would allow the enzyme to utilise l-mandelic acid as a substrate. Genes encoding for the wild-type and mutant enzymes were constructed, and the resulting bsLDH proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified using the TAGZyme system. Enzyme assays showed that insertion of this double mutation into highly purified bsLDH switched the substrate specificity from lactate to l-mandelic acid.",

The stability of this enzyme was increased in the presence of Li+ in concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mM, 1 M of sodium phosphate, or 1 M ammonium sulfate. A very significant dependence of the enzyme stability on protein concentration was found, suggesting that subunit dissociation could be the first step of GDH inactivation. This effect of enzyme concentration on its stability was not significantly decreased by the presence of 10 mM Li+. Subunit crosslinking could not be performed using neither dextran nor glutaraldehyde because both reagents readily inactivated GDH. Thus, they were discarded as crosslinking reagents and GDH was incubated in the presence of polyethyleneimine (PEI) with the aim of physically crosslinking the enzyme subunits. This incubation does not have a significant effect on enzyme activity. However, after optimization, the PEI-GDH was found to almost maintain the full initial activity after 2 h under conditions where the untreated enzyme retained only 20% of the initial activity, and the effect of the enzyme concentration on enzyme stability almost disappeared. This stabilization was maintained in the pH range 5–9, but it was lost at high ionic strength. This PEI-GDH composite was also much more stable than the unmodified enzyme in stirred systems. The results suggested that a real adsorption of the PEI on the GDH surface was required to obtain this stabilizing effect. A positive effect of Li+ on enzyme stability was maintained after enzyme surface coating with PEI, suggesting that the effects of both stabilizing agents could not be exactly based on the same mechanism. Thus, the coating of GDH surface with PEI seems to be a good alternative to have a stabilized and soluble composite of the enzyme.",

As the substrate range cannot be inferred from the sequence, it remains an early bottleneck when selecting an enzyme for a biocatalysis application. We have developed a simple first round characterisation method applicable to the broad range of aminotransferases that accept l-glutamate, the central junction of cellular transamination, as one of the amino donors. The assay is based on l-glutamate detection by its highly specific dehydrogenase enzyme in a coupled assay, ending in the reduction of the 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT). While products of most tetrazolium salts are water-insoluble, XTT is reduced to a water soluble colored formazan, allowing direct spectrophotometric detection. The reaction is carried out in microplate format using a single endpoint measurement and is thus suitable for automation.The setup was tested with 7 aminotransferase enzymes: Escherichia coli branched chain amino acid aminotransferase, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae aromatic amino acid AT, Bacillus subtilis histidinol-phosphate AT, and Thermus aquaticus aspartate, serine and histidinol-phosphate AT. In addition to 17 of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, 32 alternative substrates were tested.",

The influences of several factors on the adsorption kinetics were investigated. It was found that the kinetic behavior of lipase adsorption by macroporous resin could be well described by pseudo-first-order model. Temperature had no significant effects on lipase adsorption, while resin-to-protein ratio (R) significantly affected both rate constant (k1) and equilibrium adsorption capacity (Qe). No lipase was adsorbed when mixing (shaking) was not performed; however, protein recovery reached 98% after the adsorption was conducted at 200 rpm for 5 h in a shaker. The presence of methanol and glycerol showed significant negative influence on lipase adsorption kinetics. Particularly, increasing glycerol concentration could dramatically decrease k1 but not impact Qe. Biodiesel was found to dramatically decrease Qe even present at a concentration as low as 0.02%, while k1 was found to increase with biodiesel concentration. The adsorbed lipase showed a relatively stable catalytic activity in tert-butanol system, but poor stability in solvent-free system when used for biodiesel preparation. Oil and biodiesel were also found to adsorb onto resin during transesterification in solvent-free system. Therefore, the resin had to be washed by anhydrous methanol before re-used for lipase recovery.",

Then, the sequential treatment combining ultrasound + SC-CO2 was evaluated. Results show that treatment using SC-CO2 increased the amount of fermentable sugar obtained of about 280% compared with the non-treated bagasse, leading to a hydrolysis efficiency (based on the amount of cellulose) as high as 74.2%. Combining ultrasound + SC-CO2 treatment increased about 16% the amount of fermentable sugar obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis in comparison with the treatment using only ultrasound.

     "abstract": "The work investigated the properties and feasibility of using bacterial cellulose membrane (BCM) as a new and environmental friendly support carrier to immobilize glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) (a unique enzyme in the conversion of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production). During cultivation, the porosities of BCM decreased successively with more extended fibrils piling above one another in a criss-crossing manner thus forming condensed and spatial structure. The BCM with this ultrafine network structure was found to immobilize GAD best via covalent binding because of the highest efficiency of immobilization (87.56% of the enzyme was bonded) and a good operational stability. And the covalent binding efficiency (amount of enzyme immobilized versus lost) was closely related to the porosity or the inner network of the BCM, not to the surface area. The capacity per surface area (mg/cm2) increased from 1.267 mg/cm2 to 3.683 mg/cm2 when the porosity of BCM ranged from 49% to 73.80%, while a declining trend of the loss of GAD specific activity (from 29.30%/cm2 to 7.38%/cm2) was observed when the porosity increased from 49.9% to 72.30%. Two non-linear regression relationships, between the porosity and loading capacity and between porosity and enzyme activity loss, were empirically modeled with the determination of coefficient R2 of 0.980 and 0.977, respectively. Finally, the established in vitro enzymatic conversion process demonstrated 6.03 g/L of GABA at 0.10 mol/L Glu, 60 min of retention time and 160 mL of suspension volume after the 1st run and a loss of 4.15% after the 4th run.

Methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-hydrazide (4.5 kDa) was covalently coupled to periodate-oxidized glycosylation sites of glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger. The bioconjugate was characterized using gel electrophoresis, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and dynamic light scattering. Gel electrophoresis data showed that the PEGylation protocol resulted in a drastic increase (ca. 100 kDa) in the apparent molecular mass of the protein subunit, with complete conversion to the bioconjugate; liquid chromatography data corroborated this large increase in molecular size. Mass spectrometry data proved that the extent of PEGylation was six poly(ethylene glycol) chains per glucose oxidase dimer. Dynamic light scattering data indicated the absence of higher-order oligomers in the PEGylated GOx sample. To assess stability, enzymatic activity assays were performed in triplicate at multiple time points over the course of 29 days in the absence of glucose, as well as before and after exposure to 5% w/v glucose for 24 h. At a confidence level of 95%, the bioconjugate's performance was statistically equivalent to native glucose oxidase in terms of activity retention over the 29 day time period, as well as following the 24 h glucose exposure. Finally, the bioconjugate was entrapped within a poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) hydrogel containing an oxygen-sensitive phosphor, and the construct was shown to respond approximately linearly with a 220 ± 73% signal change (n = 4, 95% confidence interval) over the physiologically-relevant glucose range (i.e., 0–400 mg/dL); to our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of PEGylated glucose oxidase incorporated into an optical biosensing assay.",

By altering the nitrogen source (NH4Cl, putrescine and cadaverine (diamines) and butylamine (monoamine)) and concentration, we have identified a constitutive flavin dependent oxidase (EC 1.4.3.10) within Rhodococcus opacus. The activity of this oxidase can be increased by over two orders of magnitude in the presence of aliphatic diamines. In addition, the expression of a copper dependent diamine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.22) was observed at diamine concentrations > 1 mM or when cells were grown with butylamine, which acts to inhibit the flavin oxidase. A Michaelis–Menten kinetic treatment of the flavin oxidase delivered a Michaelis constant (KM) = 190 μM and maximum rate (kcat) = 21.8 s−1 for the oxidative deamination of putrescine with a lower KM (=60 μM) and comparable kcat (=18.2 s−1) for the copper oxidase.

Subsequently, a layer of porous gold nanocrystals (pAu) film was assembled onto the Pt–Au@ZnONRs film by immersing the electrode in HAuCl4 solution to perform the electrochemical deposition at a constant potential of −0.2 V.

The immobilization of the lipase from Burkholderia cepacia by the sol–gel technique using protic ionic liquids (PIL) as additives to protect against inactivation of the lipase due to release of alcohol and shrinkage of the gel during the sol–gel process was investigated in this study. The inﬂuence of various factors such as the length of the alkyl chain of protic ionic liquids (monoethanolamine-based) and a concentration range between 0.5 and 3.0% (w/v) were evaluated. The resulting hydrophobic matrices and immobilized lipases were characterised with regard to specific surface area, adsorption–desorption isotherms, pore volume (Vp) and size (dp) according to nitrogen adsorption and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), physico-chemical properties (thermogravimetric – TG, differential scanning calorimetry – DSC and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy – FTIR) and the potential for ethyl ester and emulsifier production. The total activity yields (Ya) for matrices of immobilized lipase employing protic ionic liquids as additives always resulted in higher values compared with the sample absent the protic ionic liquids, which represents 35-fold increase in recovery of enzymatic activity using the more hydrophobic protic ionic liquids. Compared with arrays of the immobilized biocatalyst without additive, in general, the immobilized biocatalyst in the presence of protic ionic liquids showed increased values of surface area (143–245 m2 g−1) and pore size (19–38 Å). Immobilization with protic ionic liquids also favoured reduced mass loss according to TG curves (always less than 42.9%) when compared to the immobilized matrix without protic ionic liquids (45.1%), except for the sample containing 3.0% protic ionic liquids (46.5%), verified by thermogravimetric analysis. Ionic liquids containing a more hydrophobic alkyl group in the cationic moiety were beneficial for recovery of the activity of the immobilized lipase. The physico-chemical characterization confirmed the presence of the enzyme and its immobilized derivatives obtained in this study by identifying the presence of amino groups, and profiling enthalpy changes of mass loss.",

Once this was established, luciferin–luciferase reaction was exploited to determine the maximum specific rate of growth, as well as cell viability in a series of routine tests. The results obtained in this preliminary study highlighted that using luciferin–luciferase can imply an over-estimation of maximum specific growth rate with respect to that determined by optical density and/or viable count. On the contrary, the bioluminescence assay gave the possibility to highlight, if employed together with viable count, physiological changes occurring in yeast cells as response to stressful environmental conditions such as those deriving from exposure of yeast cells to high temperature or those depending on the operative conditions applied during fed-batch operations.",

     "abstract": "Product inhibition of cellulolytic enzymes has been deemed a critical factor in the industrial saccharification of cellulosic biomass. Several investigations have addressed this problem using crude enzyme preparations or commercial (mixed) cellulase products, but quantitative information on individual cellulases hydrolyzing insoluble cellulose remains insufficient. Such knowledge is necessary to pinpoint and quantify inhibitory weak-links in cellulose hydrolysis, but has proven challenging to come by. Here we show that product inhibition of mono-component cellulases hydrolyzing unmodified cellulose may be monitored by calorimetry. The key advantage of this approach is that it directly measures the rate of hydrolysis while being essentially blind to the background of added product. We investigated the five major cellulases from Hypocrea jecorina (anamorph: Tricoderma reesei), Cel7A (formerly CBH1), Cel6A (CBH2), Cel7B (EG1), Cel5A (EG2) and Cel12A (EG3), for their sensitivity to the products glucose and cellobiose. The strongest inhibition was found for Cel7A, which showed a 50% activity-loss in 19 mM cellobiose (IC50 = 19 mM). The other exoglucanase, Cel6A, was much less inhibited by cellobiose, but showed the highest sensitivity to glucose among all investigated enzymes. The endoglucanases Cel12A and Cel7B were moderately inhibited by cellobiose (IC50 = 60–80 mM), and weakly inhibited by glucose (IC50 = 350–380 mM). The highest resistance to both products was found for Cel5A, which retained about 75% of its activity at the highest investigated concentrations (respectively 65 mM cellobiose and 1000 mM glucose).",

The copy number of recombinant α-CalB and nsB-CalB clones was determined by qPCR and clones with equivalent gene copies were used for comparative analysis. About threefold increased CalB production corresponding to an activity of 480 U ml−1 was obtained with its native signal peptide, whereas with the alpha signal peptide the maximum activity was 160 U ml−1. Also, CalB was secreted as a mature protein with native N-terminus when fused to its own signal peptide, while unprocessed CalB with N-terminal extension was detected with the alpha signal peptide. Real time PCR analysis of CalB strains indicated that the difference in protein expression was not at the transcriptional level. The nsB signal sequence was also effective in secreting CalA enzyme and its secretion efficiency was on par with the alpha signal sequence. Further, hGMCSF fused inframe with the nsB signal peptide was also efficiently secreted into the medium.

We expressed the gene from this thermophilic bacterium and from Rubrobacter radiotolerans, and confirmed that the recombinant enzymes, here designated mannosylglycerate hydrolase (MgH), specifically hydrolysed MG (or GG) to mannose (or glucose) and glycerate. Both enzymes were highly stable and maximally active at temperatures close to each organisms’ optimal growth temperatures (half-lives of 15.4 ± 0.5 h at 55 °C and 16.1 ± 0.4 h at 70 °C) but at low pH (4.0–4.5).

This glycoside hydrolase belongs to family 43. Unlike other GH43 enzymes, RS223-BX can be strongly activated by exogenously supplied Ca2+, Co2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, Mn2+ and Ni2+ (e.g., 28-fold by Mg2+) and it is inhibited by Cu2+ or Zn2+. Sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation experiments indicated that the divalent metal cations mediate multimerization of the enzyme from a dimeric to a tetrameric state, which have equal catalytic activity on an active-site basis. Compared to the determined active sites of other GH43 β-xylosidases, the predicted active site of RS223-BX contains two additional amino acids with carboxylated side chains that provide potential sites for divalent metal cations to reside. Thus, the divalent metal cations likely occupy the active site and participate in the catalytic mechanism. RS223-BX accepts as substrate xylobiose, arabinobiose, 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside, and 4-nitrophenyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside.

To produce bioethanol, ethanol fermentation from brown rice was conducted using a tetraploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing α-amylase and glucoamylase. The resultant ethanol was distilled and separated into three fractions with different concentrations of water and fusel alcohols. In ethanolysis using the first fraction with 89.3% ethanol, a recombinant Aspergillus oryzae whole-cell biocatalyst expressing Fusarium heterosporum lipase (r-FHL) afforded the highest ethyl ester content of 94.0% after 96 h. Owing to a high concentration of water in the bioethanol solutions, r-FHL, which works best in the presence of water when processing ethanolysis, was found to be more suitable for the integrative process than a commercial immobilized Candida antarctica lipase. In addition, r-FHL was used for repeated-batch ethanolysis, resulting in an ethyl ester content of more than 80% even after the fifth batch. Fusel alcohols such as 1-butanol and isobutyl alcohol are thought to decrease the lipase activity of r-FHL. Using this process, a high ethyl ester content was obtained by simply mixing bioethanol, plant oil, and lipase with an appropriate adjustment of water concentration. The developed process model, therefore, would contribute to biodiesel production from only biomass-derived feedstocks.",

The bilayer of UV-DAO was composed of POPC, 30 mol% of cholesterol and 15 mol% of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(glutaryl) (NGPE) that was responsible for covalent linking to d-amino acid oxidase (DAO). OV-DAO and UV-DAO showed the activity to catalyze the oxidation of d-alanine as measured based on the hydrogen peroxide produced. The oligolamellar and unilamellar structure of OV-DAO and UV-DAO, respectively was elucidated based on the quenching characteristics of bilayers-incorporated fluorescent lipid 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl-phosphoethanolamine (NBD-PE) and the size distribution of the vesicles measured with the dynamic light scattering method. The enzyme activity of OV-DAO and UV-DAO was significantly stabilized at 50 °C compared to that of free DAO at the fixed enzyme concentration of 3.29 μg/mL. At the temperature, OV-DAO and UV-DAO showed the remaining activity of 52.7 and 29.6%, respectively at the incubation time of 20 min while free DAO was completely deactivated. Thus the dimeric form of DAO could be stabilized by its coupling to the surface of UV-DAO membrane being the inner bilayer of OV-DAO. Furthermore, the thermal denaturation of DAO and dissociation of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) from the subunits of enzyme were prevented in the aqueous phase formed between the bilayers of OV-DAO.",

     "abstract": "Degradation of cellulose by anaerobic microbial consortium is brought about either by an exocellular process or by secretion of extracellular enzymes. In this work, a novel route for synthesis of nanocellulose is described where in an anaerobic microbial consortium enriched for cellulase producers is used for hydrolysis. Microcrystalline cellulose derived from cotton fibers was subjected to controlled hydrolysis by the anaerobic microbial consortium and the resultant nanocellulose was purified by differential centrifugation technique. The nanocellulose had a bimodal size distribution (43 ± 13 and 119 ± 9 nm) as revealed by atomic force microscopy. A maximum nanocellulose yield of 12.3% was achieved in a span of 7 days. While the conventional process of nanocellulose preparation using 63.5% (w/w) sulfuric acid resulted in the formation of whisker shaped nanocellulose with surface modified by sulfation, controlled hydrolysis by anaerobic microbial consortium yielded spherical nanocellulose also referred to as nano crystalline cellulose (NCC) without any surface modification as evidenced from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Also, it scores over chemo-mechanical production of nanofibrillated cellulose by consuming less energy due to enzyme (cellulase) assisted catalysis. This implies the scope for use of microbial prepared nanocellulose in drug delivery and bio-medical applications requiring bio-compatibility.",

The catalytic properties of VPBF in the oxidation of mono- and polycyclic aromatic compounds were studied also. 2,7-Diaminofluorene, ABTS, veratryl alcohol, and syringaldazine can be oxidized by VPBF in two ways: either directly by the enzyme or by diffusible chelated Mn3+ as an oxidizing agent. During VPBF oxidation of 2,7-diaminofluorene, both with and without Mn2+, biphasic kinetics with apparent saturation in both micromolar and millimolar ranges were obtained.

This knowledge may be used to direct the development of surfaces with suitable chemistry, leading enzymatic-based processes with improved performance. The results obtained show clearly that trypsin exposed to different membrane surfaces, changes its conformation, either if it adsorbs to the membrane or if it remains in solution. A significant loss of enzymatic activity was observed upon the adsorption process, for the adsorbed and non-adsorbed protein. This loss of the trypsin activity was correlated with the presence of molecular unfolding events that mediate trypsin–membrane surface interactions and the decrease of the molecular mobility of the adsorbed trypsin, which was shown to be dependent on the chemical characteristics of the membrane surface. Changes on the selectivity of the adsorbed trypsin were also observed, and may be ruled by the strength of the enzyme–surface interactions established.",

T. aurantiacus EGI showed similar patterns of pH- and temperature-dependent activities to those of T. reesei EGII which has been widely used due to its high enzyme activity. Although EGII showed higher carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) degradation activity than EGI, EGI showed better activity toward phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC). For ethanol production from PASC, we combined three types of yeast cells, each displaying T. aurantiacus EGI, T. reesei CBHII (exoglucanase) and Aspergillus aculeatus BGLI (β-glucosidase), instead of co-expressing these enzymes in a single cell. In this system, ethanol production can be easily optimized by adjusting the combination ratio of each cell type. A mixture of cells with the optimized EGI:CBHII:BGLI ratio of 6:2:1 produced 1.3 fold more ethanol (2.1 g/l) than cells composed of an equal amount of each cell type, suggesting the usefulness of this system for cellulosic ethanol production.",

     "abstract": "Boronate affinity chromatography involves the interaction between cis-diol containing molecules and the hydroxyl group of boronate. Boronate affinity based cryogel chromatography matrices have been developed and the ligands were immobilized by two methods i.e., grafting of the boronate ligand on to the matrix and by copolymerization of monomer containing boronate with other co-monomer. The boronate grafted cryogel column was used to capture adherent and non-adherent cells and the captured cells were recovered at different fructose concentrations as an eluting agent, in chromatography mode. It was found that the adherent cells could be recovered at relatively higher fructose concentration (0.5 M) than non-adherent cells which could be recovered by using low fructose concentration (0.1 M). This might be due to the difference in the content of glycoprotein in adherent and non-adherent cells. In this way a new separation method can be devised for the fractionation of adherent and non-adherent cells. In another study, a copolymerized boronate cryogel column was developed for the separation of RNA from the bacterial crude extract without any pre-processing. RNA molecules were specifically retained in the cryogel column due to interaction between 2,3′ diol group of ribose sugar in RNA and the hydroxyl group of boronate. The DNA molecules were passed through the column uninteracted due to absence of 2′-hydroxyl group. Later, bound RNA molecules were recovered from the boronate affinity cryogel column.",

     "abstract": "Hardness in water, which is caused by divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium ions, presents a major water quality problem. Because hard water must be softened before use in residential applications, there is great interest in the saltless water softening process because, unlike ion exchange softeners, it does not introduce additional ions into water. In this study, a saltless hardness removal driven by bioelectrochemical energy produced through enzymatic oxidation of glucose was proposed and investigated. Glucose dehydrogenase was coated on a carbon electrode to catalyze glucose oxidation in the presence of NAD+ as a cofactor/mediator and methylene green as an electrocatalyst. The results showed that electricity generation stimulated hardness removal compared with non-electricity conditions. The enzymatic water softener worked upon a 6 h batch operation per day for eight days, and achieved an average hardness removal of 46% at a high initial concentration of 800 mg/L as CaCO3. More hardness was removed at a lower initial concentration. For instance, at 200 mg/L as CaCO3 the enzymatic water softener removed 76.4 ± 4.6% of total hardness. The presence of magnesium ions decreased hardness removal because of its larger hydrated radius than calcium ions. The enzymatic water softener removed 70–80% of total hardness from three actual hard water samples. These results demonstrated a proof-of-concept that enzyme catalyzed electricity generation can be used to soften hard water.",

WBA activity was examined by neocuproine method using soluble starch as substrate. The Michaelis constant (Km) and molecular activity (kcat) were determined to be 1.0 ± 0.1% (w/v) and 94 ± 3 s−1, respectively, at pH 5.4 and at 25 °C. The optimum reaction temperature (Topt) for WBA activity was 55 °C and the temperature (T50) at which it loses half of the activity after 30-min incubation was 50 ± 1 °C. Modifications of the solvent with 182 mM glycine and 0.18% (w/v) gelatin have increased the T50 by 5 °C. Glycerol, ethylene glycol, dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide have also slightly enhanced the thermostability plausibly through weakening the water structure and decreasing the water shell around the WBA protein. Ethanol and DMF activated WBA by up to 24% at 25 °C probably by inducing favorable conformation for the active site or changing the substrate structure by weakening the hydrogen bonding. Its half-life in the inactivation at 55 °C was improved from 23 to 48 min by 182 mM glycine. The thermodynamic parameters indicate that WBA is thermo-labile and sufficient stabilization was achieved through solvent modification with additives and that the heat inactivation of WBA is entropic-driven. It is suggested that WBA could be applied more widely in starch-saccharification industries with employing suitable additives.",

Enzyme postgrafting of fluorescent peptides coupled with confocal microscopy was used to demonstrate transglutaminase activity towards cotton, a material typically inert to this enzyme. The grafting of alkylamines onto wool resulted in additional cross-linking by both enzymes, leading to significantly increased yarn breaking load and elongation at break.

In all cases the immobilized cells presented the superior ability to produce l-lactic acid. The comparison of batch mode and fed-batch mode also indicated that the growth-limiting feeding strategy could reduce the lag phase of fermentation process and enhance the production of l-lactic acid. The achieved maximum concentration of l-lactic acid was 142 g/l in the fed-batch mode.

A genomic analysis of L. mesenteroides ATCC 8293 revealed that 7 genes encode lactate-related dehydrogenase.

The procedure was developed using filter paper as substrate for hydrolysis with three cellulase preparations of Hypocrea jecorina containing either endoglucanase (EG), predominantly exoglucanase (ExG) or both endo- and exoglucanase activities. Hydrolysis experiments, which were followed assessing the formation of total, soluble and insoluble reducing sugars (RS), showed that up to 30 min of hydrolysis predominantly insoluble reducing sugars were formed, while after this initial hydrolysis stage soluble reducing sugar formation increased significantly, making it thus possible to measure separately EG and ExG activity. FPA activities obtained from the reaction products at different reaction times suggest that EG-activity (FPAinsol) should be measured between 10 and 20 min of hydrolysis.

To restore glucose utilization, overexpression of nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase, a rate limiting enzyme of NAD(H) synthesis encoded by the pncB gene, resulted in a significant increase in cell mass and succinic acid production. Furthermore, the results indicated a significant increase in NAD(H) pool size, and decrease in the NADH/NAD+ ratio from 0.64 to 0.13, in particular, the concentration of NAD+ increased 6.2-fold during anaerobic fermentation. In other words, the supply of enough NAD+ for NADH oxidation by regulation of NAD(H) salvage synthesis mechanism could improve the cell growth and glucose utilization anaerobically. In addition, the low NADH/NAD+ ratio also change the metabolite distribution during the dual-phase fermentation.

     "abstract": "In order to better understand the functional role of an unusual residue (Thr346) of firefly luciferase mutagenesis at this residue was performed. Firefly luciferase, catalyzes the bioluminescence reaction and is an excellent tool as a reporter in nano-system biology studies. Nonetheless, the enzyme rapidly loses its activity at temperatures above 30 °C and this leads to reduced sensitivity and precision in analytical applications. Residue Thr346 in a connecting loop (341–348) of firefly luciferase is located in a disallowed region of Ramachandran plot. In this study, we have substituted this residue (T346) with anomalous dihedral angles with Val, Gly and Pro to clarify the role of this residue in structure and function of the enzyme using site-directed mutagenesis. Substitution of this unfavorable residue (T346) with atypical dihedral angles (ψ, φ) with other residues brought about an increase of thermostability and decrease of specific activity. Structural and functional properties of the mutants were analyzed using different spectroscopic methods. It seems that this residue is a critically conserved residue to support the functional flexibility for a fast kinetic bioluminescence reaction at the expense of lower stability.",

All of the fifty-six genes encoding glycoside hydrolases identified in B. licheniformis ATCC14580 were conserved in strain SVD1. In addition, two new genes, xyn30A and axh43A, were identified in the B. licheniformis SVD1 genome. The xyn30A gene was highly similar to Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis 168 xynC encoding for a glucuronoarabinoxylan endo-1,4-β-xylanase. Xyn30A, produced by a recombinant Escherichia coli, had high activity toward 4-O-methyl-d-glucurono-d-xylan but showed definite activity toward oat-spelt xylan and unsubstituted xylooligosaccharides. Recombinant Axh43A, consisting of a family-43 catalytic module of the glycoside hydrolases and a family-6 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), was an arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase (α-l-arabinofuranosidase) classified as AXH-m23 and capable of releasing arabinosyl residues, which are linked to the C-2 or C-3 position of singly substituted xylose residues in arabinoxylan or arabinoxylan oligomers. The isolated CBM polypeptide had an affinity for soluble and insoluble xylans and removal of the CBM from Axh43A abolished the catalytic activity of the enzyme, indicating that the CBM plays an essential role in hydrolysis of arabinoxylan.",

     "abstract": "Methionine starvation can powerfully modulate DNA methylation, cell cycle transition, polyamines and antioxidant synthesis of tumor cells, in contrary to normal ones. Aspergillus flavipesl-methioninase was previously characterized by our studies, displaying affordable biochemical properties comparing to Pseudomonas putida enzyme (ONCASE). Thus, the objective of current study was to evaluate the catalytic properties of Af-METase in New Zealand rabbits, exploring its antitumor efficacy. In vivo, Af-METase (40.8 U/ml) have T1/2 19.8 h, elimination constant 0.088 U/h and apparent volume distribution 85 U/ml. Also, Af-METase has two maxima one at A280 nm (apo-enzyme) and at A420 nm (internal Schiff base of PLP), unlike control plasma (without enzyme). The two peaks of absorption spectra were detected maximally at 15 min then the absorbance at 420 nm was subsequently decreased with circulation time, due to dissociation of the co-enzyme. The A280/420 ratio was increased from 1.69 to 5.81 with circulation time from 15 to 30 h. Rabbits plasma methionine was depleted from 18.7 μM (control) to 8.8 μM after 1 h of enzyme injection and completely omitted after 2 h till 19 h, assuming the sustainability of negligible levels of methionine (<2 μM) in plasma of rabbits, for about 17 h. Upon infusion of PLP, the T1/2 of Af-METase was significantly prolonged by 3.2 fold, assuming the fully reconstitution of the enzyme. The holo-AfMETase still retained its co-enzyme, completely, till 33 h of PLP infusion. From spectral studies, the internal aldimine linkage of apo-Af-METase was constructed upon PLP infusion, with fully catalytic structure after less than 4 h of its infusion, the A280/420 ratio being not relatively changed till 45 h. After 25 days of last enzyme dose, the titer of IgG was increase by about 1.66 fold comparing to control (without enzyme). However, IgM was not detected along the tested challenge points. In vitro, plasma anti-Af-METase neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were assessed, with no significant reduction on activity of Af-METase by Nab. All the hematological parameters were in normal range, otherwise, the RBCs titer and platelet level was slightly increased, after 25 days of Af-METase injection, comparing to control. There is no obvious negative effect on chemistry of liver, kidney, glucose, lipids, and other electrolytes. Additionally, the anticancer activity of Af-METase was evaluated against five types of human cancer cell lines, in vitro. The enzyme showed a powerful activity against prostate (PC3), liver (HEPG2) and breast (MCF7) cancers, with IC50 0.001 U/ml, 0.26 U/ml and 0.37 U/ml, respectively.",

When this recombinant yeast was cultivated by batch fermentation in YP medium containing 2% galactose, it produced 2.6 mg/L p-coumaric acid and 3.3 mg/L resveratrol. In order to increase the pool of malonyl-CoA, a key precursor in resveratrol biosynthesis, the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1) gene was additionally overexpressed in the yeast by replacing the native promoter of the ACC1 gene with the stronger GAL1 promoter and this resulted in enhanced production of resveratrol (4.3 mg/L). Furthermore, when tyrosine was supplemented in the medium, the concentration of resveratrol increased up to 5.8 mg/L. This result illustrates a possible strategy for developing metabolically engineered yeast strain for the economical production of resveratrol from cheap amino acids.",

The substrate scope of this chimera basically represented the average of both wild-type enzymes, but surprisingly the T 50 60 was noticeably increased by 7 °C up to 55.3 °C.

But these genes exhibited different expression profiles. Moreover, SA25 (25 mg/L SA) induction had a greater effect on the transcriptional expression of ipi-1, psy, pds, crtR-B and lyc (more than 6-fold up-regulation) than on ipi-2, bkt and crtO, but SA50 (50 mg/L SA) treatment had a greater impact on the transcriptional expression of ipi-1, ipi-2, pds, crtR-B and lyc than on psy, bkt and crtO. Furthermore, astaxanthin biosynthesis under SA was up-regulated mainly by ipi-1, ipi-2, psy, crtR-B, bkt and crtO at transcriptional level, lyc at post-transcriptional level and pds at both levels. Summarily, these results suggest that SA constitute molecular signals in the network of astaxanthin biosynthesis.

Interestingly, both roles of reducing and stabilizing agents are played by β-NADPH. Nanoparticles obtained by this route exhibit a good crystallinity, a narrow size distribution and excellent stability in aqueous solution. The most advantageous points of this single-step environmentally friendly approach are that it takes place at nearly room temperature (20 °C), overcomes many limitations encountered in other biological methods (such as the restricted concentration of AgNO3, maintenance and manipulation of microorganisms, preparing extracts and contamination from residual reactants), bypasses the use of surfactants or capping agents and does not necessitate pH adjustment. The nano-Ag were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, UV–vis, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). DLS, TEM and XRD measurements showed the formation of nano-Ag with an average diameter of 20.77 ± 0.67 nm. XRD studies confirmed the nanocrystalline nature of the silver particles. Zeta potential measurements revealed that the particles are surrounded with negatively charged groups (−41 ± 5 mV) making them stable in an aqueous medium. The EDX spectrum of the silver nanoparticles confirmed the presence of elemental silver signal in high percentage. In addition to the easy and ecofriendly method of synthesis, β-NADPH can be regenerated by enzymatic means through glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, potentially making the synthesis more cost effective.",

To increase ethanol production from glycerol, a greater tolerance to osmotic and ethanol stress was engineered in yeast strains that were impaired in endogenous glycerol production by the overexpression of both SPT3 and SPT15, components of the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase) complex. The engineered strain YPH499fps1Δgpd2Δ (pGcyaDak, pGupSpt3.15Cas) formed significantly more biomass compared to the strain YPH499fps1Δgpd2Δ (pGcyaDak, pGupCas), and both engineered strains displayed increased biomass when compared to the control YPH499 fps1Δgpd2Δ (pESC-TRP) strain. The trehalose accumulation and ergosterol content of these strains were 2.3-fold and 1.6-fold higher, respectively, than the parent strains, suggesting that levels of cellular membrane components were correlated with the enhanced stress tolerance of the engineered strains. Consequently, the ethanol production of the engineered strain YPH499fps1Δgpd2Δ (pGcyaDak, pGupSpt3.15Cas) was 1.8-fold more than that of strain YPH499fps1Δgpd2Δ (pGcyaDak, pGupCas), with about 8.1 g/L ethanol produced.

The nisin producer L. lactis ATCC11454 strain has been genetically engineered by cloning a truncated version of the phosphofructokinase gene (pfk13), along with the pkaC, encoding for the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and the alternative oxidase (aox1) genes of A. niger. Functional expression of the above genes resulted in enhanced PFK activity and the introduction of AOX activity and alternative respiration in the presence of a source of heme in the substrate, under fully aerobic growth conditions. The constructed strain is capable of fermenting high concentrations of glucose as was demonstrated in a series of glucostat fed-batch fermentations with glucose levels maintained at 55, 138 and 277 mM. The high maximum specific uptake rate of glucose of 1.8 mM s−1 g CDW−1 at 277 mM glucose is characteristic of the improved ability of the microorganism to handle elevated glucose concentrations under conditions otherwise causing severe reduction of PFK activity. The increased carbon flow through glycolysis led to increased protein synthesis that was reflected in increased biomass and nisin levels. The pfk13–pkaC–aox1-transformant strain's fermentation at 277 mM glucose gave a final biomass concentration of 7.5 g/l and nisin activity of 14,000 IU/ml which is, compared to the parental strain's production levels at its optimal 55 mM glucose, increased by a factor of 2.34 for biomass and 4.37 for nisin.",

For the alcoholysis of cod liver oil, absolute ethanol, ethanol 96% (v/v) and 1-butanol were compared; the conditions with ethanol 96% were then optimized and 2-MAG yields of around 54–57% were attained using Novozym 435. In these 2-MAGs, DHA accounted for 24–31% of total fatty acids. In the operational conditions this lipase maintained a stable level of activity over at least 11 uses. These results were compared with those obtained with lipase DF, which deactivated after only three uses. The alcoholysis of cod liver oil and ethanol 96% catalyzed by Novozym 435 was scaled up by multiplying the reactant amounts 100-fold and maintaining the intensity of treatment constant (IOT = 3 g lipase h/g oil). In these conditions, the 2-MAG yield attained was about 67%; these 2-MAGs contained 36.6% DHA. The synthesized 2-MAGs were separated and purified from the alcoholysis reaction products by solvent extraction using solvents of low toxicity (ethanol and hexane); 2-MAG recovery yield and purity of the target product were approximately 96.4% and 83.9%, respectively.

Current methods to improve lipase stability in detergent formulations usually entail a decrease in the enzymatic activity, thus lowering the general performance of the detergent. This work proposes an alternative approach for enzyme stabilization and activity enhancement based on the application of amphiphilic light-harvesting copolymers, called here photozymes. The biopolymer-based chitosan-Rose Bengal and the synthetic poly(SSS0.75–co-VBA0.24–co-VB/hematoporphyrin0.01) photozymes were used as boosting agents in washing formulations containing lipase. Organic stain removal from textiles was improved by 33% at 25 °C. This cleaning enhancement was attributed to the increase of lipase activity due to interfacial activation in presence of photozymes, along with prevention of dirt re-deposition on the cleaned surfaces. Although both photozymes improved lipase activity, chitosan-Rose Bengal photozyme performed better at pHs above 9 while at pHs below this value SSS–VBA–VB/HP was the most effective. Dynamic light scattering, zeta-potential measurements, fluorescence spectroscopy and FRET experiments confirmed the pseudomicellar conformation and hosting capacity of the photozymes in aqueous media leading to improved dirt solubilization and emulsification. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of the photozyme allowed for a de-coloration of the waste washing liquor upon UV irradiation.",

     "abstract": "Dramatic increases in dengue (DEN) incidence and disease severity have been reported, in great part due to the geographic expansion of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. One result is the expanded co-circulation of all dengue 1-4 serotype viruses (DENV) in urban areas worldwide, especially in South and South-East Asia, and South America. DEN disease severity ranges from asymptomatic infections to febrile dengue fevers (DF) to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). There is an urgent need for a safe and effective tetravalent DEN vaccine. Several live attenuated, tetravalent DEN vaccine candidates have been generated by recombinant DNA technology; these candidates are capable of providing immunity to all four DENV serotypes. In this paper we review (a) recombinant live-attenuated DEN vaccine candidates in terms of deletion, antigen chimerization, and the introduction of adaptive mutations; (b) strategies for improving tetravalent vaccine attenuation; and (c) live-attenuated DENV vaccine development.",

To increase the Ile biosynthesis in Corynebacterium glutamicum ssp. lactofermentum JHI3-156, NADPH supply needs to be enhanced. Here NAD kinase, the key enzyme for the de novo biosynthesis of NADP+ and NADPH, were cloned and expressed in JHI3-156, and their influences on Ile production were analysed. Meanwhile, enzyme properties of NAD kinase from JHI3-156 (CljPpnK) were compared with that from C. glutamicum ssp. lactofermentum ATCC 13869 (ClPpnK). Four variations existed between CljPpnK and ClPpnK. Both PpnKs were poly(P)/ATP-dependent NAD kinases that used ATP as the preferred phosphoryl donor and NAD+ as the preferred acceptor. CljPpnK exhibited a higher activity and stability than ClPpnK and less sensitivity towards the effectors NADPH, NADP+, and NADH, partly due to the variations between them. The S57P variation decreased their activity. Expression of CljppnK and ClppnK in JHI3-156 increased the ATP-NAD+ kinase activity by 69- and 47-fold, respectively, the intracellular NADP+ concentration by 36% and 101%, respectively, the NADPH concentration by 95% and 42%, respectively, and Ile production by 37% and 24%, respectively. These results suggest that overexpressing NAD kinase is a useful metabolic engineering strategy to improve NADPH supply and isoleucine biosynthesis.",

The activity of the encapsulated HRP was examined for thermal stability, long-term storage stability, and resistance to a denaturant. They showed good storage stability, retaining its activity up to 90%, while the free HRP lost 50% of its activity over the course of 18 days. At 55 °C, the encapsulated HRP activity remained 20% higher than that of the free HRP. With the denaturant, guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmHCl), the encapsulated HRP activity was maintained around 10% higher than the free HRP.

Both systems efficiently converted d-xylulose into xylitol without the addition of expensive NADH. Approximately 26.91 g/L xylitol was obtained from around 30 g/L d-xylulose within system 1 (E. coli Rosetta/Duet-xdh-gdh), with a 92% conversion yield, somewhat higher than that of system 2 (E. coli Rosetta/Duet-xdh-adh, 24.9 g/L, 85.2%). The xylitol yields for both systems were more than 3-fold higher compared to that of the G. oxydans NH-10 cells (7.32 g/L). The total turnover number (TTN), defined as the number of moles of xylitol formed per mole of NAD+, was 32,100 for system 1 and 17,600 for system 2. Compared with that of G. oxydans NH-10, the TTN increased by 21-fold for system 1 and 11-fold for system 2, hence, the co-expression systems greatly enhanced the NADH supply for the conversion, benefiting the practical synthesis of xylitol.",

     "abstract": "The activity of transaldolase and transketolase, key enzymes in the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, is rate-limiting for xylose utilization in recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Overexpression of TAL1 and TKL1, the major transaldolase and transketolase genes, increases the flux from the pentose phosphate pathway into the glycolytic pathway. However, the functional roles of NQM1 and TKL2, the secondary transaldolase and transketolase genes, especially in xylose utilization, remain unclear. This study focused on characterization of NQM1 and TKL2, together with TAL1 and TKL1, regarding their roles in xylose utilization and fermentation. Knockout or overexpression of these four genes on the phenotype of xylose-utilizing S. cerevisiae strains was also examined. Transcriptional analysis indicated that the expression of TAL1, NQM1, and TKL1 was up-regulated in the presence of xylose. A significant decrease in both growth on xylose and xylose-fermenting ability in tal1Δ and tkl1Δ mutants confirmed that TAL1 and TKL1 are essential for xylose assimilation and fermentation. Gene disruption analysis using a tkl1Δ mutant revealed that TKL1 is also required for utilization of glucose. Growth on xylose and xylose-fermenting ability were slightly influenced by deletion of NQM1 or TKL2 when xylose was used as the sole carbon source. Moreover, the rate of xylose consumption and ethanol production was slightly impaired in TKL1- and TKL2-overexpressing strains. NQM1 and TKL2 may thus play a physiological role via an effect on the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in the xylose metabolic pathway, although their roles in xylose utilization and fermentation are less important than those of TAL1 and TKL1.",

The encoded enzyme (LacER) was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and treatment in an acidic buffer. This enzyme was identified as a NADH-dependent enoate reductase, which had a Km of 0.034 ± 0.006 mM and kcat of (3.2 ± 0.2) × 103 s−1 toward NADH using 2-cyclohexen-1-one as the substrate. Its Km and kcat toward substrate 2-cyclohexen-1-one were 1.94 ± 0.04 mM and (8.4 ± 0.2) × 103 s−1, respectively. The enzyme showed a maximum activity at pH 8.0–9.0. The optimum temperature of the enzyme was 50–55 °C, and LacER was relatively stable below 60 °C. The enzyme was active toward aliphatic alkenyl aldehyde, ketones and some cyclic anhydrides. Substituted groups of cyclic α,β-unsaturated ketones and its ring size have positive or negative effects on activity. (R)-(−)-Carvone was reduced to (2R,5R)-dihydrocarvone with 99% conversion and 98% (diasteromeric excess: de) stereoselectivity, indicating a high synthetic potential of LacER in asymmetric synthesis.",

The agaA disruptant was subsequently complemented by transforming it with agaA expression vectors. Both citA and trpC promoters were able to drive the expression of arginase cDNA.

     "abstract": "Bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass to fuel requires a hydrolysis step to obtain fermentable sugars, generally accomplished by fungal enzymes. Large-scale screening of different microbial strains would provide optimal enzyme cocktails for any target feedstock. The aim of this study was to screen a large collection of Trichoderma sp. strains for the hydrolytic potential towards switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.). Strains were cultivated in a small-scale system and assayed in micro-plates for xylanase and cellulase activities. The population distributions of these traits are reported after growth on switchgrass in comparison with cellulose. The distribution profiles suggest that the growth on switchgrass strongly promotes xylanase production. The IK4 strain displayed the highest xylanase activity after growth on switchgrass (133 U/mL). Enzymes (10 FPU/g substrate) from IK4 were compared with those from 2 cellulolytic Trichoderma strains and a commercial enzyme in saccharification time-course experiments on untreated and pretreated switchgrass and on an artificial substrate. Samples were analysed by DNS assay and by an oxygraphic method for sugar equivalent or glucose concentration. On the untreated substrate, IK4 enzymes even outperformed a 5-fold load of commercial enzyme, suggesting that xylanase or accessory enzymes are a limiting factor on this type of recalcitrant substrate. On the other substrates, IK4 preparations showed intermediate behaviour if compared with the commercial enzyme at 10 FPU/g substrate and at 5-fold load. IK4 also nearly halved the time to release 50% of the hydrolysable sugar equivalents (T50%), with respect to the other preparations at the same enzymatic load. DNS assay and oxygraphic method gave highly correlated results for the 3 saccharified substrates. The study suggests that accessory enzymes like xylanase play a key role in improving the performance of cellulase preparations on herbaceous lignocellulosic feedstocks like switchgrass.",

Universal biosensor based on non-specific Pseudomonas fluorescens P75 (P. fluorescens) was used to conduct comparison experiments.

The present contribution, dealing with the facultative photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum, reveals not only the strong influence of ambient carbon dioxide on the fermentative break-down of fructose but also a high impact on aerobic growth with fructose as sole carbon source. Both growth rates and biomass yield increased with increasing carbon dioxide supply in chemoheterotrophic aerobic cultures. Furthermore, intracellular metabolite concentration measurements showed almost negligible concentrations of the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates succinate, fumarate and malate under aerobic growth, in contrast to several metabolites of the glycolysis. In addition, we present a dual phase fed-batch process, where an aerobic growth phase is followed by an anaerobic production phase. The biosynthesis of bacteriochlorophyll and the secretion of organic acids were both affected by the carbon dioxide supply, the pH value and by the cell density at the time of switching from aerobic to anaerobic conditions. The formation of pigmented photosynthetic membranes and the amount of bacteriochlorophyll were inversely correlated to the secretion of succinate. Accounting the high biotechnological potential of R. rubrum, optimization of carbon dioxide supply is important because of the favored application of fructose-containing fermentable feedstock solutions in bio-industrial processes.",

Bacterial GAD exhibits an acidic pH optimum and there is often a sharp pH dependence. In the present work, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to delete the C-terminal residues of GAD to generate a mutant, designated as GADΔC, which exhibited extended activity toward near-neutral pH compared to the wild type. Comparison of the UV–visible, fluorescence and Circular Dichroism spectra of the mutant with those of the wild type revealed that the microenvironment of the active site had been changed.

The final yield and purity were approximately 20.4% and 10.3%, respectively.

Enzymes have advantages over metal catalysts, as they provide high specificity and reaction rates, while operating under mild conditions. Here we report on studies related to development of mass-producible, completely enzymatic printed glucose/oxygen biofuel cells. The cells are based on filter paper coated with conducting carbon inks containing mediators and laccase, for reduction of oxygen, or aldose dehydrogenase, for oxidation of glucose. Mediator performance in these printed formats is compared to relative rate constants for the enzyme–mediator reaction in solution, for a range of anode and cathode mediators. The power output and stability of fuels cells using an acidophilic laccase isolated from Trametes hirsuta is greater, at pH 5, than that for cells based on Melanocarpus albomyces laccase, that shows optimal activity closer to neutral pH, at pH 6. Highest power output, although of limited stability, was observed for ThL/ABTS cathodes, providing a maximum power density of 3.5 μW cm−2 at 0.34 V, when coupled to an ALDH glucose anode mediated by an osmium complex. The stability of cell voltage above a threshold of 200 mV under a moderate 75 kΩ load is used to benchmark printed fuel cell performance. Highest stability was obtained for a printed fuel cell using osmium complexes as mediators of glucose oxidation by aldose dehydrogenase, and oxygen reduction by T. hirsuta laccase, maintaining cell voltage above 200 mV for 137 h at pH 5.

Enzyme to substrate ratio had no significant effect on maximum yield and specific productivity. Galacto-oligosaccharide syntheses at very high lactose concentrations (40, 50 and 60%, w/w, lactose monohydrate) were evaluated at different temperatures (40, 47.5 and 55 °C). Within these ranges, lactose could be found as a supersaturated solution or a heterogeneous system with precipitated lactose, resulting in significant effect on GOS synthesis. An increase in initial lactose concentration produced a slight increase in maximum yield as long as lactose remained dissolved. Increase in temperature produced a slight decrease in maximum yield and an increase in specific productivity when supersaturation of lactose occurred during reaction. Highest yield of 29 g GOS/100 g lactose added was obtained at a lactose monohydrate initial concentration of 50% (w/w) and 47.5 °C.

Devising an efficient enzyme recycling strategy requires a good understanding of how the enzymes adsorb, distribute, and interact with the substrate during hydrolysis. We investigated the interaction of individual Trichoderma reesei enzymes present in a commercial cellulase mixture during the hydrolysis of steam-pretreated corn stover (SPCS). The enzyme profiles were followed using zymograms, gel electrophoresis, enzyme activity assays and mass spectrometry. The adsorption and activity profiles of 6 specific enzymes Cel7A (CBH I), Cel7B (EG I), Cel5A (EG II), Xyn 10 (endo-1,4-β-xylanase III), Xyn 11 (endo-xylanase II), and β-glucosidase were characterized. Initially, each of the enzymes rapidly adsorbed onto the SPCS. However, this was followed by partial desorption to an adsorption equilibrium where the Cel7A, Cel7B, Xyn 10, and β-glucosidase were partially adsorbed to the SPCS and also found free in solution throughout the course of hydrolysis. In contrast, the Cel5A and Xyn 11 components remained primarily free in the supernatant. The Cel7A component also exhibited a partial desorption when the rate of hydrolysis leveled off as evidenced by MUC zymogram and SDS-PAGE. Those cellulase components that did not bind to the substrate were generally less stable and lost their activities within the first 24 h when compared to enzymes that were distributed in both the liquid and solid phases. Therefore, to ensure maximum enzyme activity recovery, enzyme recycling seems to be most effective when short-term rounds of hydrolysis are combined with the recovery of enzymes from both the liquid and the solid phases and potentially enzyme supplementation to replenish lost activity.",

A limiting factor in developing efficient processes is identifying microorganisms that are able to effectively ferment xylose, the major pentose sugar found in hemicellulose, and break down carbohydrate polymers without pre-treatment steps. Here, a basidiomycete brown rot fungus was isolated as a new biocatalyst with unprecedented fermentability, as it was capable of converting not only the 6-carbon sugars constituting cellulose, but also the major 5-carbon sugar xylose in hemicelluloses, to ethanol. The fungus was identified as Neolentinus lepideus and was capable of assimilating and fermenting xylose to ethanol in yields of 0.30, 0.33, and 0.34 g of ethanol per g of xylose consumed under aerobic, oxygen-limited, and anaerobic conditions, respectively. A small amount of xylitol was detected as the major by-product of xylose metabolism. N. lepideus produced ethanol from glucose, mannose, galactose, cellobiose, maltose, and lactose with yields ranging from 0.34 to 0.38 g ethanol per g sugar consumed, and also exhibited relatively favorable conversion of non-pretreated starch, xylan, and wheat bran. These results suggest that N. lepideus is a promising candidate for cost-effective and environmentally friendly ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass.

     "abstract": "Elastase plays an important role in wound healing process, degrading damaged tissue and allowing complete tissue recovery. The levels of human neutrophil elastase (HNE) are usually controlled by endogenous inhibitors. However, in the presence of high levels of elastase, like the ones present in chronic wounds, the inhibitors cannot overcome this overproduction and the enzyme starts to degrade the surrounding healthy tissue. In this work we report the development of a molecular switch to control the elastase activity in the exudate of non-healing chronic wounds. A peptide library was generated and screened in a microarray format for protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation. Two peptides were identified as casein kinase Iδ (CKI) substrates: KRCCPDTCGIKCL and its analogous peptide KRMMPDTMGIKML, with cysteine residues replaced by methionine residues. These peptides were studied in solution, both in the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms as potential inhibitors for elastase. The obtained results show that the reversible process of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation results in differential inhibitory activity of the peptides. Thus the reversible process of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation can be used as a kind of molecular switch to control elastase activity. Degradation studies reveal that both the inhibitor-peptides and CKI are degraded by elastase. These results envisage the safe utilisation of these inhibitor-peptides together with CKI in the formulation of wound dressings.",

It is possible to in situ detoxify these inhibitory compounds by aldehyde reductions using tolerant Saccharomyces cerevisiae. YOL151W (GRE2) is a commonly recognized up-regulated gene expressed under stress conditions that encodes reductase activities toward furfural and HMF using cofactor NADH. Applying a directed enzyme evolution approach, we altered the genetic code of GRE2 yielding two mutants with amino acid substitutions of Gln261 to Arg261 and Phe283 to Leu283; and Ile107 to Val107, Gln261 to Arg261, and Val285 to Asp285 for strain Y62-C11 and Y62-G6, respectively. Clones of these mutants showed faster growth rates and were able to establish viable cultures under 30 mM HMF challenges when compared with a wild type GRE2 clone when inoculated into synthetic medium containing this inhibitor. Compared with the wild type control, crude cell extracts of the two mutants showed 3- to 4-fold and 3- to 9-fold increased specific enzyme activity using NADH toward HMF and furfural reduction, respectively. While retaining its aldehyde reductase activities using the cofactor NADH, mutant Y62-G6 displayed significantly greater reductase activities using NADPH as the cofactor with 13- and 15-fold increase toward furfural and HMF, respectively, as measured by its partially purified protein. Using reverse engineering and site directed mutagenesis methods, we were able to confirm that the amino acid substitution of the Asp285 is responsible for the increased aldehyde reductase activities by utilizing the additional cofactor NADPH.",

Enzymatically solubilized β-1,4-galactan-rich potato pulp polysaccharides of molecular weights >100 kDa (SPPP) are highly bifidogenic in human fecal sample fermentations in vitro. The objective of the present study was to use potato β-1,4-galactan and the SPPP as substrates for enzymatic production of potentially prebiotic compounds of lower and narrower molecular weight. A novel endo-1,4-β-galactanase from Emericella nidulans (anamorph Aspergillus nidulans), GH family 53, was produced in a recombinant Pichia pastoris strain. The enzyme was purified by Cu2+ affinity chromatography and its optimal reaction conditions were determined to pH 5 and 49 °C via a statistical experimental design. The specific activity of the E. nidulans enzyme expressed in P. pastoris was similar to that of an endo-1,4-β-galactanase from Aspergillus niger used as benchmark. The E. nidulans enzyme expressed in P. pastoris generated a spectrum poly- and oligo-saccharides which were fractionated by membrane filtration. The potential growth promoting properties of each fraction were evaluated by growth of beneficial gut microbes and pathogenic bacteria. All the galactan- and SPPP-derived products promoted the growth of probiotic strains of Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus and generally did not support the propagation of Clostridium perfringens in single culture fermentations. Notably the growth of B. longum was significantly higher (p < 0.05) or at least as good on galactan- and SPPP-derived products as fructooligosaccharides (FOS). Except in one case these products did not support the growth of the pathogen Cl. perfringens to any significant extent.",

Hydrogels readily formed when a diluted buffered solution of the modified protein and MBA was exposed to LW-UV in the presence of 1-[4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl]-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-propan-1-one (Irgacure 2959) as the radical initiator. In contrast, no hydrogel was obtained in the absence of a polymerizable BSA, nor when the cross-linker, the radical initiator or UV light exposure was excluded from the reaction, suggesting the critical importance of the combined conditions for hydrogel formation. Hydrogels were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the swelling ratios were monitored at different pHs. The esterolytic activity of the novel biohybrid materials was quantitatively investigated via UV–vis spectroscopy by measuring the release of para-nitrophenol upon incubation with para-nitrophenyl acetate (p-NPA) substrate. The effect of the addition of acrylic acid co-monomer and of the monomer concentration in the catalytic activity and in the swelling behavior was also examined.

     "abstract": "Glyoxal oxidase of P. chrysosporium is a radical copper oxidase that catalyzes oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids coupled to dioxygen reduction to H2O2. In addition to known substrates, glycerol is also found to be a substrate for glyoxal oxidase. During enzyme turnover, glyoxal oxidase undergoes a reversible inactivation, probably caused by loss of the active site free radical, resulting in short-lasting enzyme activities and undetectable substrate conversions. Enzyme activity could be extended by including two additional enzymes, horseradish peroxidase and catalase, in addition to a redox chemical activator, such as Mn(III) (or Mn(II) + H2O2) or hexachloroiridate. Using this three-enzyme system glycerol was converted in glyceric acid in a two-step reaction, with glyceraldehyde as intermediate. A possible operation mechanism is proposed in which the three enzymes would work coordinately allowing to maintain a sustained glyoxal oxidase activity. In the course of its catalytic cycle, glyoxal oxidase alternates between two functional and interconvertible reduced and oxidized forms resulting from a two-electron transfer process. However, glyoxal oxidase can also undergo an one-electron reduction to a catalytically inactive form lacking the active site free radical. Horseradish peroxidase could use glyoxal oxidase-generated H2O2 to oxidize Mn(II) to Mn(III) which, in turn, would reoxidize and reactivate the inactive form of glyoxal oxidase. Catalase would remove the excess of H2O2 generated during the reaction. In spite of the improvement achieved using the three-enzyme system, glyoxal oxidase inactivation still occurred, which resulted in low substrate conversions. Possible causes of inactivation, including end-product inhibition, are discussed.",

As an approach to overcome this drawback, E. coli MG1655 was engineered for simultaneous glucose (in the form of cellobiose) and xylose utilization by a combination of genetic and evolutionary engineering strategies. The recombinant E. coli was capable of utilizing approximately 6 g/L of cellobiose and 2 g/L of xylose in approximately 36 h, whereas wild-type E. coli was unable to utilize xylose completely in the presence of 6 g/L of glucose even after 75 hours.

The substitutions with GC in VHbS was intended to convert codons from lower usage to higher, yet causing no change to the encoded amino acid. Plasmids containing either one of these genes or genes in various combinations were introduced into Streptomyces sp.

The results showed that recombinant P. pastoris strains harboring the lip2 and vgb genes (VHb+) displayed higher biomass and YlLIP2 activity than control strains (VHb−).

Under non-limiting dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions, the maximum YlLIP2 activity of VHb+ in a 10-L fermentor reached 33,000 U/mL. Oxygen limitation had a more negative effect on YlLIP2 productivity in VHb− cells than in VHb+ cells. The highest YlLIP2 activity of VHb+ cells was approximately 1.84-fold higher than that of VHb− cells at lower DO levels. Moreover, the recombinant strain VHb+ exhibited a higher specific oxygen uptake rate and achieved higher cell viability under oxygen limiting and non-limiting conditions compared with VHb− cells.

Wild strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are widely used in industry for production of 1st generation ethanol, and the robustness of this yeast is an important advantage in large scale applications. Isomerization of xylose to xylulose is an essential step in this process. This reaction is catalyzed by glucose isomerase (GI). A new biocatalyst is presented here for the simultaneous isomerization and fermentation (SIF) of xylose. GI from Streptomyces rubiginosus was immobilized in chitosan, through crosslinking with glutaraldehyde, and the support containing the immobilized GI (IGI-Ch) was co-immobilized with S. cerevisiae, in calcium alginate gel. The immobilization experiments led to high immobilized protein loads ( 30 – 68 mg × g s upport − 1 ) , high yields (circa of 100%) and high recovered enzyme activity (>90%). The IGI-Ch derivative with maximum activity presented 1700 IU × g catalyst − 1 , almost twice the activity of a commercial immobilized GI, GENSWEET® IGI-HF. At typical operational conditions for xylose SIF operation (pH 5, 30–35 °C, presence of nutrients and ethanol concentrations in the medium up to 70 L−1), both derivatives, IGI-Ch and GENSWEET® IGI-HF retained app. 90% of the initial activity after 120 h, while soluble GI was almost completely inactive at pH 5, 30 °C.

     "abstract": "Sucrose isomerase (SI) activity is used industrially for the conversion of sucrose into isomers, particularly isomaltulose or trehalulose, which have properties advantageous over sucrose for some food uses. All of the known microbial SIs are TIM barrel proteins that convert sucrose without need for any cofactors, with varying kinetics and product specificities. The current analysis was undertaken to bridge key gaps between the information in patents and scientific publications about the microbes and enzymes useful for sucrose isomer production.This analysis shows that microbial SIs can be considered in 5 structural classes with corresponding functional distinctions that broadly align with the taxonomic differences between producing organisms. The most widely used bacterial strain for industrial production of isomaltulose, widely referred to as “Protaminobacter rubrum” CBS 574.77, is identified as Serratia plymuthica. The strain producing the most structurally divergent SI, with a high product specificity for trehalulose, widely referred to as “Pseudomonas mesoacidophila” MX-45, is identified as Rhizobium sp.Each tested SI-producer is shown to have a single SI gene and enzyme, so the properties reported previously for the isolated proteins can reasonably be associated with the products of the genes subsequently cloned from the same isolates and SI classes. Some natural isolates with potent SI activity do not catabolize the isomer under usual production conditions. The results indicate that their industrial potential may be further enhanced by selection for variants that do not catabolize the sucrose substrate.",

In this study we report the recovery of active epimerase from inclusion bodies by direct solubilization with Tris buffer. At pH 7.0, 25% of the inclusion bodies were solubilized with Tris buffer. The specific activity of the solubilized proteins, 2.08 ± 0.02 U/mg, was similar to that of the native protein, 2.13 ± 0.01 U/mg. The result of circular dichroism spectroscopy analysis indicated that the structure of the solubilized epimerase obtained with pH 7.0 Tris buffer was similar to that of the native epimerase purified from the clarified cell lysate. As expected, the extent of deviation in CD spectra increased with buffer pH. The total enzyme activity recovered by solubilization from inclusion bodies, 170.41 ± 10.06 U/l, was more than 2.5 times higher than that from the clarified cell lysate, 67.32 ± 5.53 U/l. The results reported in this study confirm the hypothesis that the aggregation of proteins into inclusion bodies is reversible and suggest that direct solubilization with non-denaturing buffers is a promising approach for the recovery of active proteins from inclusion bodies, especially for aggregation-prone multisubunit proteins.",

     "abstract": "The efficient use of cellulases in the hydrolysis of pretreated lignocellulosic biomass is limited due to the presence of lignin. Lignin is known to bind hydrolytic enzymes nonspecifically, thereby reducing their action on carbohydrate substrates. The composition and location of residual lignin therefore seem to be important for optimizing the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic substrates. The use of lignin-modifying enzymes such as laccase may have potential in the modification or partial removal of lignin from the biomass. In this study, the effect of lignin modification by laccase on the hydrolysis of pretreated spruce (Picea abies) and giant reed (Arundo donax) was evaluated. The substrates were first treated with laccase and then hydrolyzed with commercial cellulases. Laccase modification improved the hydrolysis yield of spruce by 12%, but surprisingly had an adverse effect on giant reed, reducing the hydrolysis yield by 17%. The binding properties of cellulases on the untreated and laccase-treated lignins were further studied using isolated lignins. The laccase treatment reduced the binding of enzymes on modified spruce lignin, whereas with giant reed, the amount of bound proteins increased after laccase treatment. Further understanding of the reactions of laccase on lignin will help to control the unspecific-binding of cellulases on lignocellulosic substrates.",

     "abstract": "The complete genome sequencing of a γ-hexachlorocyclohexane-degrading strain, Sphingobium japonicum UT26, revealed that the genome consists of two circular chromosomes [with sizes of 3.5 Mb (Chr1) and 682 kb (Chr2)], a 191-kb large plasmid (pCHQ1), and two small plasmids with sizes of 32 and 5 kb. The lin genes are dispersed on Chr1, Chr2, and pCHQ1. Comparison of the UT26 genome with those of other sphingomonad strains demonstrated that the “specific” lin genes for conversion of γ-HCH to β-ketoadipate (linA, linB, linC, linRED, and linF) are located on the DNA regions unique to the UT26 genome, suggesting the acquisition of these lin genes by horizontal transfer events. On the other hand, linGHIJ and linKLMN are located on the regions conserved in the genomes of sphingomonads, suggesting that the linGHIJ-encoded β-ketoadipate pathway and the LinKLMN-type ABC transporter system are involved in core functions of sphingomonads. Based on these results, we propose a hypothesis that UT26 was created by recruiting the specific lin genes into a strain having core functions of sphingomonads. Most of the specific lin genes in UT26 are associated with IS6100. Our analysis of spontaneous linA-, linC-, and linRED-deletion mutants of UT26 revealed the involvement of IS6100 in their deduced genome rearrangements. These facts strongly suggest that IS6100 plays important roles both in the dissemination of the specific lin genes and in the genome rearrangements.",

     "abstract": "Polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) are toxic and persistent organic pollutants that are widely distributed in the environment. Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 is capable of degrading aerobically an unusually wide range of PCBs. However, during PCB-degradation B. xenovorans LB400 generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that affect its viability. The aim of this study was to increase the efficiency of PCB-degradation of B. xenovorans LB400 by adding antioxidant compounds that could increase tolerance to oxidative stress. The effect of antioxidant compounds on the growth, morphology and PCB-degradation by B. xenovorans LB400 was evaluated. α-Tocopherol or vitamin E (vitE) and berry extract (BE) increased slightly the growth of strain LB400 on biphenyl, whereas in presence of ascorbic acid or vitamin C (vitC) an inhibition of growth was observed. The growth of B. xenovorans LB400 in glucose was inhibited by the addition of 4-chlorobiphenyl (4-CB). Interestingly, in presence of α-tocopherol the growth of strain LB400 was less affected by 4-CB. By transmission electronic microscopy it was observed that α-tocopherol preserved the cell membranes and improved cell integrity of glucose-grown LB400 cells exposed to 4-CB, suggesting a protective effect of α-tocopherol. Notably, α-tocopherol increased biphenyl and 4-CB degradation by B. xenovorans LB400 in an aqueous solution. The effect of antioxidants compounds on PCB-bioremediation was evaluated in agricultural soil spiked with 2-chlorobiphenyl (2-CB), 4-CB and 2,4′-chlorobiphenyl (2,4′-CB). For bioaugmentation, LB400 cells grown on biphenyl and subsequently incubated with pyruvate were added to the soil. Native soil microbiota was able to remove PCBs. Bioaugmentation with strain LB400 increased strongly the PCB-degradation rate. Bioaugmentation with strain LB400 and biostimulation with α-tocopherol or berry extract increased further the PCB degradation. Half-life of 2,4′-CB decreased by bioaugmentation from 24 days to 4 days and by bioaugmentation in presence of α-tocopherol and berry extract to 2 days. By bioaugmentation with strain LB400, 85% of 2,4′-CB was degraded in 20 days, whereas bioaugmentation with strain LB400 and biostimulation with α-tocopherol or berry extract reduced the time to less than 13 days. This indicates that antioxidant compounds stimulated PCB-degradation in soil. Therefore, the addition of antioxidant compounds constitutes an attractive strategy for the scale-up of aerobic PCB-bioremediation processes.",

However, the presence of halides in these effluents (up to 1 M NaCl) which inhibit laccases is a drawback for bioremediation processes. In order to develop an efficient enzymatic remediation process for textile dye effluent, the possibility to reduce this halide inhibition is conditioned by a better understanding of the phenomenon. The present study gives a detailed account of the kinetics of chloride inhibition of both ABTS (a model substrate) and ABu62 (an anthraquinonic acid dye) oxidations catalyzed by Trametes versicolor laccase (LacIIIb). Chloride inhibition can be described by a mixed model for ABTS and a non-competitive model for ABu62 and both inhibitions are linear suggesting a single inhibitory site for chloride. Experiments were also conducted in presence of both substrates. An apparent activation of laccase was observed in the presence of ABu62 leading to an enhancement of the oxidation rate of ABTS. The extent of activation increased in the presence of chloride anions. Finally, for the first time to our knowledge, we evidenced that inhibition of ABTS oxidation by chloride can be reduced in the presence of ABu62.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the isolation of a Gram-negative rubber-degrading bacterium other than γ-proteobacteria. Gel permeation chromatography analysis revealed that these strains degraded poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) to low-molecular-weight products.

The lcp gene of LCIC4, which showed 99% amino acid sequence identity with that of Streptomyces sp. strain K30, was cloned, and contained a putative twin-arginine motif at its N terminus. It is located next to oxiB, which is estimated to be responsible for oxidation of degradation intermediate of rubber in K30.

In this study, β-galactosidase was immobilized by adsorption on a mixed-matrix membrane containing zirconium dioxide. The maximum β-galactosidase adsorbed on these membranes was 1.6 g/m2, however, maximal activity was achieved at an enzyme concentration of around 0.5 g/m2. The tests conducted to investigate the optimal immobilization parameters suggested that higher immobilization can be achieved under extreme parameters (pH and temperature) but the activity was not retained at such extreme operational parameters. The investigations on immobilized enzymes indicated that no real shift occurred in its optimal temperature after immobilization though the activity in case of immobilized enzyme was better retained at lower temperature (5 °C). A shift of 0.5 unit was observed in optimal pH after immobilization (pH 6.5 to 7). Perhaps the most striking results are the kinetic parameters of the immobilized enzyme; while the Michaelis constant (Km) value increased almost eight times compared to the free enzyme, the maximum enzyme velocity (Vmax) remained almost constant.",

     "abstract": "Starch-binding domains (SBDs) comprise distinct protein modules that bind starch, glycogen or related carbohydrates and have been classified into different families of carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). The present review focuses on SBDs of CBM20 and CBM48 found in amylolytic enzymes from several glycoside hydrolase (GH) families GH13, GH14, GH15, GH31, GH57 and GH77, as well as in a number of regulatory enzymes, e.g., phosphoglucan, water dikinase-3, genethonin-1, laforin, starch-excess protein-4, the β-subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase and its homologues from sucrose non-fermenting-1 protein kinase SNF1 complex, and an adaptor–regulator related to the SNF1/AMPK family, AKINβγ. CBM20s and CBM48s of amylolytic enzymes occur predominantly in the microbial world, whereas the non-amylolytic proteins containing these modules are mostly of plant and animal origin. Comparison of amino acid sequences and tertiary structures of CBM20 and CBM48 reveals the close relatedness of these SBDs and, in some cases, glycogen-binding domains (GBDs). The families CBM20 and CBM48 share both an ancestral form and the mode of starch/glycogen binding at one or two binding sites. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that they exhibit independent behaviour, i.e. each family forms its own part in an evolutionary tree, with enzyme specificity (protein function) being well represented within each family. The distinction between CBM20 and CBM48 families is not sharp since there are representatives in both CBM families that possess an intermediate character. These are, for example, CBM20s from hypothetical GH57 amylopullulanase (probably lacking the starch-binding site 2) and CBM48s from the GH13 pullulanase subfamily (probably lacking the starch/glycogen-binding site 1). The knowledge gained concerning the occurrence of these SBDs and GBDs through the range of taxonomy will support future experimental research.",

Silaffin proteins are responsible for the formation of a silica-based cell matrix of diatoms, and synthetic variants of the R5 protein can perform silicification in vitro[1]. GOx secreted by P. pastoris was self-immobilized (biosilicification) in a pH 5 citric buffer using 0.1 M tetramethoxysilane as a silica source. This self-entrapment property of GOx–R5 was used to immobilize GOx on a graphite rod electrode. An electric cell designed as a biosensor was prepared to monitor the glucose concentrations. The electric cell consisted of an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a platinum counter electrode, and a working electrode modified with poly(neutral red) (PNR)/GOx/Nafion. Glucose oxidase was immobilized by fused protein on poly(neutral red) and covered by Nafion to protect diffusion to the solution. The morphology of the resulting composite PNR/GOx/Nafion material was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This amperometric transducer was characterized electrochemically using cyclic voltammetry and amperometry in the presence of glucose. An image produced by scanning electron microscopy supported the formation of a PNR/GOx complex and the current was increased to 1.58 μA cm−1 by adding 1 mM glucose at an applied potential of −0.5 V. The current was detected by way of PNR-reduced hydrogen peroxide, a product of the glucose oxidation by GOx. The detection limit was 0.67 mM (S/N = 3). The biosensor containing the graphite rod/PNR/GOx/Nafion detected glucose at various concentrations in mixed samples, which contained interfering molecules. In this study, we report the first expression of R5 fused to glucose oxidase in eukaryotic cells and demonstrate an application of self-entrapped GOx to a glucose biosensor.",

Thermal activation of laccase was also increased after introducing the mutations. Remarkably, the Glu188Lys variant showed 3-fold higher thermal activation and higher T50 (5 °C) with respect to the native enzyme. Furthermore steady-state kcat and Km values were influenced despite the distance between the mutated position and the catalytic site. In Glu188Arg mutation, the kcat was improved 3-fold and Km reduced by 25%. Interestingly, all three variants showed higher stability against urea as a chemical denaturant.

Potentials of all electrodes and H2 accumulation were monitored in the system under the precise pH control. Results obtained with the hydrogen-producing microbial consortium indicated that HE generates the potential equal to the H2|2H+ equilibrium potential. Furthermore, HE was able to catalyze the current generation (200 μA) by consuming H2 gas produced in the microbial consortium from starch. After 220 h of operation, HE retained at least 81% of the initial activity.

Acetate shows a strong effect on both yield and productivity of succinic acid. In this study, the fed-batch process of succinic acid production by NZN111 using acetate in a chemically defined medium in the aerobic stage was investigated and developed. Increasing cell density could increase succinic acid with a productivity of 3.97 g/(L h) in the first 8 h of the anaerobic phase with an overall yield of 1.42 mol/mol glucose in a 5 L fermentor. However, there was strong repression from succinic acid in the later anaerobic stage. When succinic acid exceeded 30 g/L, the glucose consumption rate began to drop sharply along with the succinic acid production rate. Supplementation with glucose from 30 to 70 g/L in the anaerobic stage showed little effect on succinic acid production. Acetic acid and pyruvic acid accumulated had no effect on succinic acid formation because of their low concentration. With acetate as the sole carbon source for aerobic cultivation in the following scale-up, 60.09 g/L of succinic acid was produced with a yield of 1.37 mol/mol in a 50 L bioreactor.",

Therefore, mixtures of dyes belonging to azo and anthraquinonic classes, chosen among the most utilized in textile wool dyeing, were employed for comparative enzymatic decolorization studies using the extracellular extracts from the white rot fungus Funalia trogii, to understand how the concomitant presence of more than one dye could influence their degradation course and yield.Fungal extracts containing laccase activity only were capable to partially decolorize dyes mixtures from the different classes analyzed. The deconvolution of the decolorization with time allowed to monitor the degradation of the single dyes in the mixtures evidencing a time dependent differential decolorization not observed for the singles alone. Some dyes in the blend were in fact decolorized only when the most easily converted dyes were largely transformed. These experiments would allow to help the dyeing factories in the selection of the most readily degraded dyes.Since F. trogii grown on different media and activators shows diverse levels of expression of the redox enzymes laccase and cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH), the dyes mixtures recalcitrant to decolorization by laccase activity alone, were subjected to the combined action of extracts containing laccase and CDH. The use of CDH, in support to the activity of laccase, resulted in substantial decolorization increases (>84%) for all the refractory dyes mixtures.",

     "abstract": "The effects of biological pretreatment on Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus globulus, were evaluated after exposure to two brown rot fungi Gloephylum trabeum and Laetoporeus sulphureus. Changes in chemical composition, structural modification, and susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis in the degraded wood were analyzed. After eight weeks of biodegradation, the greatest loss of weight and hemicellulose were 13% and 31%, respectively, for P. radiata with G. trabeum. The content of glucan decreased slightly, being the highest loss of 20% for E. globulus with G. trabeum. Consistent with degradation mechanism of these fungi, lignin was essentially undegraded by both brown rot fungi. Both brown rot fungi cause a sharp reduction in the cellulose degree of polymerization (DP) in the range between 58% and 79%. G. trabeum depolymerized cellulose in both wood faster than L. sulphureus. Also, structural characteristic of crystalline cellulose were measured by using two different techniques – X-ray diffraction (XRD) and infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The biological pretreatments showed an effect on cellulose crystallinity structure, a decrease between 6% and 21% was obtained in the crystallinity index (CrI) calculated by IR, no changes were observed in the XRD. Material digestibility was evaluated by enzymatic hydrolysis, the conversion of cellulose to glucose increased with the biotreatment time. The highest enzymatic hydrolysis yields were obtained when saccharification was performed on wood biopretreated with G. trabeum (14% P. radiata and 13% E. globulus). Decreasing in DP and CrI, and hemicellulose removal result in an increase of enzymatic hydrolysis performance. Digestibility was better related to DP than with other properties. G. trabeum can be considered as a potential fungus for biological pretreatment, since it provides an effective process in breaking the wood structure, making it potentially useful in the development of combined pretreatments (biological–chemical). A viable alternative to pretreatment process that can be used is a bio-mimetic system, similar to low-molecular complexes generated by fungi such as G. trabeum combined pretreatments (biological–chemical).",

Between 10 and 20 batches could be run with decolorization yields from 95 to 52% depending on the dye type. To study the possibility of reusing both enzyme and mediator, the reactor was run using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl (TEMPO) coupled to polyethylene glycol (PEG). Nine batches were run for the treatment of Remazol Blue RR, providing decolorization yields of 96–78%. Cost analysis of the processes showed that the costs of laccase/syringaldehyde or laccase/TEMPO were almost equal when running 20 batches, but the cost for the PEG-TEMPO was higher. However, the advantages associated with reuse of the mediator should motivate further development of the concept.",

In particular, the development of effective methods for immobilizing large multi-subunit proteins with multiple covalent linkages (multi-point immobilization) has been effective in stabilizing proteins where subunit dissociation is the initial step in enzyme inactivation. In some instances, multiple benefits are achievable in a single process.Here we comprehensively review the literature pertaining to immobilization and chemical modification of different enzyme classes from thermophiles, with emphasis on the chemistries involved and their implications for modification of the enzyme functional properties.

The experimental results suggest rather strong enzyme-specific interactions with TAN in reasonable agreement with enzyme specific lignin inhibition found in the literature. Enzyme–TAN interactions were disrupted by the presence of NIS by a mechanism of strong TAN–NIS interaction. The presence of NIS also alleviated the inhibitory effect of TAN on cellulase activity.

Based on the evolution law of pyrene fluorescence spectroscopy in the “surfactants–enzymes” systems, the interaction relationship between surfactants and enzymes was analyzed and discussed in this paper. The results show that enzyme molecules bind with rhamnolipid molecules, participate in the formation of rhamnolipid micelles, and increase the inner hydrophobic polarity of micelles, but do not change the properties of rhamnolipid micelles above the CMC (Critical Micelle Concentration). Nevertheless, for Tween 80, enzyme molecules also participate in the forming of micelles, however, they exhibit a stronger interaction with enzymes above the CMC. Both rhamnolipid and Tween 80 bind more strongly with xylanase than cellulase. Considering also previous experimental results, it can be concluded that the interaction between surfactants and enzymes improve enzyme stability and activity, and, therefore, the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose is enhanced.

     "abstract": "ω-Transaminase (ω-TA) is the only naturally occurring enzyme allowing asymmetric amination of ketones for production of chiral amines. The active site of the enzyme was proposed to consist of two differently sized substrate binding pockets and the stringent steric constraint in the small pocket has presented a significant challenge to production of structurally diverse chiral amines. To provide a mechanistic understanding of how the (S)-specific ω-TA from Paracoccus denitrificans achieves the steric constraint in the small pocket, we developed a free energy analysis enabling quantification of individual contributions of binding and catalytic steps to changes in the total activation energy caused by structural differences in the substrate moiety that is to be accommodated by the small pocket. The analysis exploited kinetic and thermodynamic investigations using structurally similar substrates and the structural differences among substrates were regarded as probes to assess how much relative destabilizations of the reaction intermediates, i.e. the Michaelis complex and the transition state, were induced by the slight change of the substrate moiety inside the small pocket. We found that ≈80% of changes in the total activation energy resulted from changes in the enzyme–substrate binding energy, indicating that substrate selectivity in the small pocket is controlled predominantly by the binding step (KM) rather than the catalytic step (kcat). In addition, we examined the pH dependence of the kinetic parameters and the pH profiles of the KM and kcat values suggested that key active site residues involved in the binding and catalytic steps are decoupled. Taken together, these findings suggest that the active site residues forming the small pocket are mainly engaged in the binding step but not significantly involved in the catalytic step, which may provide insights into how to design a rational strategy for engineering of the small pocket to relieve the steric constraint toward bulky substituents.",

     "abstract": "Lipase from Geobacillus thermocatenulatus (BTL2) was immobilized in two different matrixes. In one derivative, the enzyme was immobilized on agarose activated with cyanogen bromide (CNBr-BTL2) via its most reactive superficial amino group, whereas the other derivative was covalently immobilized on glyoxyl agarose supports (Gx-BTL2). The latter immobilization protocol leads to intense multipoint covalent attachment between the lysine richest region of enzyme and the glyoxyl groups on the support surface. The resulted solid derivatives were unfolded by incubation under high concentrations of guanidine and then resuspended in aqueous media under different experimental conditions. In both CNBr-BTL2 and Gx-BTL2 derivatives, the oxidation of Cys residues during the unfolding/refolding processes led to inefficient folding for the enzyme because only 25–30% of its initial activity was recovered after 3 h in refolding conditions. Dithiothreitol (DTT), a very mild reducing agent, prevented Cys oxidation during the unfolding/refolding process, greatly improving activity recovery in the refolded forms. In parallel, other variables such as pH, buffer composition and the presence of polymers and other additives, had different effects on refolding efficiencies and refolding rates for both derivatives. In the case of solid derivatives of BTL2 immobilized on CNBr-agarose, the surface's chemistry was crucial to guarantee an optimal protein refolding. In this way, uncharged protein vicinities resulted in better refolding efficiencies than those charged ones.",

Recombinant expression of halohydrin dehalogenase from Arthrobacter sp. AD2 (HheA) in Escherichia coli using T7 promoter-based pGEF(+) system revealed much lower expression level than that of the well-studied halohydrin dehalogenase from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 (HheC). In this study, we changed the codon usage in the 5′-end of hheA gene to improve the expression yield of HheA. Our results showed that the expression of HheA could be largely improved by the replacement of G-rich +2 codon (adjacent to the start codon) with less G-containing codons. The expression of one of the resulting mutants HheA-D1 (replaced +2 codon GTG with CCA) was about 4-fold higher and purified yields about 8-fold greater than that of the wild-type HheA. Moreover, the expression level of the resulting HheA variants correlated well with the minimal folding free energy (ΔG) of the mRNA secondary structure surrounding the 5′-end region of the genes. These findings suggested that the G-rich +2 codon of hheA gene might be the main suppressive factor for limiting the recombinant expression of HheA and that +2 codon optimization strategy could be used as a general tool in modulating recombinant protein production in E. coli.",

For this reaction, enzyme loading, methanol/oil molar ratio, silica gel dosage, glycerol content, and methanol feeding method were tested using commercial immobilized enzymes (Novozym 435 and Lipozyme RM IM from Novozymes). The results showed that conversion was highest with controlled substrate feeding rather than direct methanol addition, suggesting that the method developed here can easily prevent enzyme inhibition by limiting methanol concentration to an acceptable level.",

Furthermore, the antimicrobial activities of the immobilized lysosomal enzymes were confirmed using viable cell counts against Escherichia coli. Our results showed that the antimicrobial activity of immobilized lysosomal enzymes is stable and can be maintained up to one month, but the antimicrobial activity of free enzymes without immobilization completely disappeared after five days in storage. In addition, enhanced immobilization efficiency was shown in TiO2 pretreated with a divalent, positively charged ion, Ca2+, and the antimicrobial activity for E. coli increased as a function of increasing ratio of immobilized enzymes. However, K+, a monovalent, positively charged ion, did not have any positive effect on immobilization or antimicrobial activity.

The stem–loop structured probes were “closed” when target was absent, then the hybridization of the target induced the conformational changes to “open”, along with the biotin at its 3′ end binding with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and subsequent quantiﬁcation of the target was detected via electrochemical detecting the enzymatic product in the presence of substrate.

Bromocresol green was chosen as the indicator because it has a similar pKa to the acetate buffer used. The corresponding absorbance change at 620 nm was recorded with a microplate reader as the reaction proceeded. A difference in the enzyme preparation pH and optimal pH for GAD activity of 2.5 did not prevent this method from successfully allowing the determination of reaction kinetic parameters and the detection of improvements in enzymatic activity with a low coefficient of variance.

     "abstract": "Potato pulp is a high-volume co-processing product resulting from industrial potato starch manufacturing. Potato pulp is particularly rich in pectin, notably galactan branched rhamnogalacturonan I polysaccharides, which are highly bifidogenic when solubilized. The objective of the present study was to characterize and compare four homogalacturonan degrading enzymes capable of catalyzing the required solubilization of these pectinaceous polysaccharides from potato pulp in a 1 min reaction. An additional purpose was to assess the influence of the pH and the potential buffer chelating effects on the release of these polysaccharides from the potato pulp. The pH and temperature optima of two selected pectin lyases from Emericella nidulans (formerly known as Aspergillus nidulans) and Aspergillus niger were determined to 8.6 and 4.0, respectively, at ≥100 °C within 1 min of reaction. The optima for the two selected polygalacturonases from E. nidulans and Aspergillus aculeatus were determined to pH 4.4 and 46 °C, and pH 3.7 and ≥80 °C, respectively. The polygalacturonase from A. aculeatus was 4–42 times more heat-resistant at 50 °C than the other enzymes. The difference in pH optima of the pectin lyases and the exceptional thermal stabilities of some of the enzymes are proposed to be related to specific amino acid substitutions, stabilizing hydrogen bonding and structural traits of the enzymes. The KM and Vmax values ranged from 0.3–0.6 g/L and 0.5–250.5 U/mg protein, respectively. Phosphate buffer induced release of a higher amount of dry matter than Tris–acetate buffer at pH 6, indicating a chelating effect of the phosphate. Moreover, the phosphate had a higher chelating effect at pH 6 than at pH 4. The optimal conditions for a high yield of polysaccharides from potato pulp were therefore: 1% (w/w) potato pulp treated with 1% (w/w) enzyme/substrate (E/S) pectin lyase from E. nidulans and 1% (w/w) E/S polygalacturonase from A. aculeatus at pH 6.0 and 60 °C for 1 min.",

     "abstract": "Bacteria have been evolving antibiotic resistance since their discovery in the early twentieth century. Most new antibiotics are derivatives of older generations and there are now bacteria that are virtually resistant to almost all antibiotics. This poses a global threat to human health and has been classified as a clinical “super-challenge”, which has necessitated research into new antimicrobials that inhibit bacterial virulence while minimizing selective pressures that lead to the emergence of resistant strains. Quorum sensing (QS), the process of population dependent bacterial cell–cell signaling, can accelerate bacterial virulence and is an increasingly interesting target for developing next generation antimicrobials. Most QS inhibitors target species-specific signals, such as acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) and oligopeptides. Methodologies for intercepting the cross-species signal, autoinducer-2 (AI-2), have only recently emerged. We review these strategies to prevent the relay of the AI-2 signal amongst pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Vibrio cholerae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Inhibition mechanisms are categorized based on the target (i.e., enzymes for signal generation, the signal molecule itself, or the various components of the signal transduction process). The universal nature of the AI-2 signal imparts on its inhibitors the potential for broad spectrum use.",

     "abstract": "Through the proteome analysis of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), we previously identified the stress-responsive protein, arsenate reductase (ArsC), that showed a high cytoplasmic solubility and a folding capacity even in the presence of stress-inducing reagents. In this study, we used ArsC as an N-terminal fusion partner to synthesize nine aggregation-prone proteins as water-soluble forms. As a result, solubility of the aggregation-prone proteins increased dramatically by the fusion of ArsC, due presumably to its tendency to facilitate the folding of target proteins. Also, we evaluated and confirmed the efficacy of ArsC-fusion expression in making the fusion-expressed target proteins have their own native function or structure. That is, the self-assembly function of human ferritin light chain, l-arginine-degrading function of arginine deiminase, and the correct secondary structure of human granulocyte colony stimulating factor were clearly observed through transmission electron microscope analysis, colorimetric enzyme activity assay, and circular dichroism, respectively. It is strongly suggested that ArsC can be in general an efficient fusion expression partner for the production of soluble and active heterologous proteins in E. coli.",

We evaluated pH-induced structural changes in BLG using circular dichroism, tryptophan fluorescence and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements, where after these results were correlated with the analysis of cross-linking by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Intermolecular cross-linking of BLG by TrTyr was found at pH 9 but not at pH 7.5. AbTyr was unable to catalyze cross-linking at pH 7.5 or pH 9. Increased accessibility and cross-linking by TrTyr was addressed to loosening of the three dimensional structure of the protein, increased flexibility of the backbone as well as partial hydrolysis.

Specifically, Cys383 of recombinant rat procarboxypeptidase B was replaced by other amino acids to increase the refolding efficiency in vitro. Mutants C383G, C383A and C383S could refold successfully, but mutants C383R, C383E, C383L and C383Y failed to refold correctly. Compared with wild type, the refolding efficiencies of mutants C383G and C383A were enhanced. The Cys383 mutations changed some of the properties of rat carboxypeptidase B. Mutants C383G, C383A had higher kcat/Km values which indicated increased catalytic abilities. And both had higher thermal stability. pH had different effects on the activities and stabilities of the mutant and wild type proteins. The studies suggested that mutating Cys383 of rat procarboxypeptidase B could improve the renaturation process by increasing the refolding efficiency. This new method could be taken as a new attempt to improve the refolding efficiency of other recombinant proteins containing disulfide bonds that are expressed as inclusion bodies. While the results also claimed that the potential effects of the substituted amino acid on the protein itself should be seriously considered in addition to its ability to reduce the probability of disulfide mismatches.",

     "abstract": "Enzyme immobilization is an ever-growing research-area for both analytical and industrial applications. Of critical importance in this area are the effects of immobilization procedures upon the functionality of the immobilized biomolecules. Both beneficial and detrimental effects can be conferred through the selection and tuning of the immobilization procedure. Quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) has been previously used to great effect in tracking alterations to thin films of biomolecules immobilized onto quartz transducers.In this study, we investigate the ability of QCM-D to track and monitor film parameters of a monolayer of laccase immobilized on a series of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), differing in lateral density of binding residues on the SAM and height of the SAM from the quartz surface. Both mass gains and rheological parameters for these varying surfaces were measured and trends later compared to the apparent enzyme kinetics of the immobilized laccase films, assessed electroanalytically (Paper II in this two part study). For covalent attachment of proteins, both shear and viscosity were increased relative to physically adsorbed proteins. An increase in lateral density of protein-binding surface of the SAM components was shown to increase the shear/viscosity of the resultant film while an increase in distance from the electrode (through incorporation of lysine linkers) was shown to decrease the shear/viscosity while simultaneously increasing the wet mass gain of the films. Shear and viscosity may be indicative of both enzyme denaturation and increased lateral protein packing within the film structure hence it is assumed that less distortion occurs with the inclusion of linkers which allow for more optimal protein immobilization.",

     "abstract": "The method of immobilization of a protein has a great influence on the overall conformation, and hence, functioning of the protein. Thus, a greater understanding of the events undergone by the protein during immobilization is key to manipulating the immobilization method to produce a strategy that influences the advantages of immobilization while minimizing their disadvantages in biosensor design.In this, the second paper of a two-part series, we have assessed the kinetic parameters of thin-film laccase monolayers, covalently attached to SAMs differing in spacer-arm length and lateral density of spacer arms. This was achieved using chronoamperometry and an electroactive product (p-benzoquinone), which was modeled in a non-linear regressional fashion to extract the relevant parameters. Finally, comparisons between the kinetic parameters presented in this paper and the rheological parameters of laccase monolayers immobilized in the same manner (Part I of this two paper series) were performed.Improvements in the maximal enzyme-catalysed current, imax, the apparent Michaelis–Menten constant, Km and the apparent biosensor sensitivity were noted for most of the surfaces with increasing linker length. Decreasing the lateral density of the spacer-arms brought about a general improvement in these parameters, which is attributed to the decrease in multiple points of immobilization undergone by functional proteins. Finally, comparisons between rheological data and kinetics data showed that the degree of viscosity exhibited by protein films has a negative influence on attached protein layers, while enhanced protein hydration levels (assessed piezoelectrically from data obtained in Paper 1) has a positive effect on those surfaces comprising rigidly bound protein layers.",

The RGI Lyase was purified by Cu2+ affinity chromatography and 1.1 g pure enzyme was achieved pr. L. When the denatured protein was deglycosylated with EndoH, the molecular weight of the protein decreased to 65 kDa, which correlated with the predicted molecular weight of the mature RGI Lyase of 596 amino acids. By use of a statistical design approach, with potato rhamnogalacturonan as the substrate, the optimal reaction conditions for the RGI Lyase were established to be: 61 °C, pH 8.1, and 2 mM of both Ca2+ and Mn2+ (specific activity 18.4 U/mg; KM 1.2 mg/ml). The addition of both Ca2+ and Mn2+ was essential for enzyme activity. The enzyme retained its catalytic activity at higher temperatures and the enzyme has a half life at 61 °C of 15 min.

     "abstract": "Site-directed mutagenesis of a thermostable alkaline phytase from Bacillus sp. MD2 was performed with an aim to increase its specific activity and activity and stability in an acidic environment. The mutation sites are distributed on the catalytic surface of the enzyme (P257R, E180N, E229V and S283R) and in the active site (K77R, K179R and E227S). Selection of the residues was based on the idea that acid active phytases are more positively charged around their catalytic surfaces. Thus, a decrease in the content of negatively charged residues or an increase in the positive charges in the catalytic region of an alkaline phytase was assumed to influence the enzyme activity and stability at low pH. Moreover, widening of the substrate-binding pocket is expected to improve the hydrolysis of substrates that are not efficiently hydrolysed by wild type alkaline phytase. Analysis of the phytase variants revealed that E229V and S283R mutants increased the specific activity by about 19% and 13%, respectively. Mutation of the active site residues K77R and K179R led to severe reduction in the specific activity of the enzyme. Analysis of the phytase mutant–phytate complexes revealed increase in hydrogen bonding between the enzyme and the substrate, which might retard the release of the product, resulting in decreased activity. On the other hand, the double mutant (K77R–K179R) phytase showed higher stability at low pH (pH 2.6–3.0). The E227S variant was optimally active at pH 5.5 (in contrast to the wild type enzyme that had an optimum pH of 6) and it exhibited higher stability in acidic condition. This mutant phytase, displayed over 80% of its initial activity after 3 h incubation at pH 2.6 while the wild type phytase retained only about 40% of its original activity. Moreover, the relative activity of this mutant phytase on calcium phytate, sodium pyrophosphate and p-nitro phenyl phosphate was higher than that of the wild type phytase.",

The cells of bacterium Zymomonas mobilis ATCC 29191 containing this enzymatic complex were submitted to permeabilization and reticulation procedures. The effect of the concentration of substrates on the rate of product formation using a mobilized cell system was investigated. The application of higher fructose concentration seems to not affect the initial rate of formation of the bionic acid. Under conditions of low initial concentration of lactose, the experimental kinetic data of the bi-substrate reaction were modelled by assuming a rate equation of the classical ping-pong mechanism. The found kinetic parameters displayed a low affinity of the GFOR enzyme for both substrates. The enzymatic system did not exhibit normal Michaelis–Menten kinetics in response to a change of concentration of lactose, when fructose was held constant, presenting a sigmoid relationship between initial velocity and substrate concentration. A rate equation based on Hill kinetics was used to describe the kinetic behaviour of this enzyme-substituted reaction at higher lactose concentrations. The results from batch experiments using immobilized cells within Ca-alginate beads revealed that there is no pronounced occurrence of mass transfer limitations on LBA production for beads with 1.2 mm in average diameter. This discussion aids for defining the best operating conditions to maximize the productivity for LBA and sorbitol in this bioconversion and also for reducing the complexity of downstream separation processes.",

     "abstract": "Despite the fact that the area of glycolysis in Lactococcus lactis has been intensively studied, only a limited number of studies have been focused on the regulation of uptake of glucose itself. Using the tool of the glucostat fed-batch mode of culture, it was demonstrated in our earlier work that the concentration of glucose regulates its uptake rate and that the control of the glycolytic flux resides to a large extent in processes outside the pathway itself, like glucose transport and the ATP consuming reactions, while allosteric properties of key enzymes like phosphofructokinase (PFK) have a significant influence on the control. Extending our work, we report here the results of fermentations with engineered L. lactis strains with altered PFK activity in which the pfkA gene from Aspergillus niger, and its truncated version pfk13 that encodes a shorter PFK1 fragment were cloned. The results in this study suggest that, under the optimum for the microorganism applied microaerobic conditions, the glycolytic capacity of L. lactis was significantly increased in engineered strains with increased PFK activity. The transformant strain in which the truncated pfk13 gene of A. niger was expressed performed more efficiently as it was able to grow successfully in glucostat cultures with 277 mM glucose – while the optimum glucose concentration for the parental strain was 55 mM. The present work demonstrates the direct effect of PFK activity on the glycolytic flux in L. lactis since a twofold increase in specific PFK activity (from 7.1 to 14.5 U/OD600) resulted in a proportional increase of the maximum specific rates of glucose uptake (from 0.8 to 1.7 μM s−1 g CDW−1) and lactate formation (from 15 to 22.8 g lactate (g CDW)−1 h−1).",

Our results indicated that, to ensure good performances in the SEC refolding process, the appropriate front and tail volumes of chaperon solvent plug should be slightly larger than the optimal values, which depend on the flow dispersion from the injector to the column inlet. However, with the front volume more than the optimum, it could have an adverse effect on activity recovery but not the mass recovery, while no effect at all if the tail volume exceeded the optimum.

Thermal stability of the FaDH activity was examined with and without liposomes composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC). Rapid deactivation of free FaDH was observed at 60 °C because of its dissociation into two subunits. The rate of dissociative deactivation of POPC liposome-encapsulated FaDH was smaller than that of the free enzyme. The liposomal FaDH was however progressively deactivated for the incubation period of 60 min eventually leading to complete loss of its activity. The free FaDH and NADH molecules were revealed to form the thermostable binary complex. The thermal stability of POPC liposome-encapsulated FaDH and NADH system was significantly higher than the liposomal enzyme without cofactor. The above results clearly show that NADH is a key molecule that controls the activity and stability of FaDH in liposomes at high temperatures.",

     "abstract": "In this paper, we report new sequence data for secreted thermostable fungal enzymes from the un-sequenced xylanolytic filamentous fungus Talaromyces emersonii and reveal novel insights on the potential role of enzymes relevant as wheat dough improvers. The presence of known and de novo enzyme sequences were confirmed through NanoLC–ESI–MS/MS and resultant peptide sequences were identified using SWISS PROT databases. The de novo protein sequences were assigned identity based on homology to known fungal proteins. Other proteins were assigned function based on the limited T. emersonii genome coverage. This approach allowed the identification of enzymes with relevance as wheat dough improvers. Rheological examination of wheat dough and wheat flour components treated with the thermostable fungal enzyme cocktail revealed structural alterations that can be extrapolated to the baking process.Thermoactive amylolytic, xylanolytic, glucanolytic, proteolytic and lipolytic enzyme activities were observed. Previously characterized T. emersonii enzymes present included; β-glucosidase, xylan-1,4-β-xyloxidase, acetylxylan esterase, acid trehalase, avenacinase, cellobiohydrolase and endo-glucanase. De novo sequence analysis confirmed peptides as being; α-glucosidase, endo-1,4-β-xylanase, endo-arabinase, endo-glucanase, exo-β-1,3-glucanase, glucanase/cellulase, endopeptidase and lipase/acylhydrolase. Rheology tests using wheat dough and fractioned wheat flour components in conjunction with T. emersonii enzymes show the role of these novel biocatalysts in altering properties of wheat substrates. Enzyme treated wheat flour fractions showed the effects of particular enzymes on appropriate substrates. This proteomic approach combined with rheological characterization is the first such report to the authors’ knowledge.",

During the anoxic phase, nitrate ammonification was the major source of N2O emission while denitrification performed as a sink of N2O, in all three bioreactors. The N2O emission mechanisms during the aerobic phase differed with the aeration rate. At low and high aeration rates (Run 1 and Run 3), both coupled-denitrification and nitrifier denitrification were ascribed to be the source of N2O emission. At mild aeration rate (Run 2), nitrifier denitrification by Nitrosomonas-like ammonia oxidizing-bacterial (AOB) was responsible for N2O emission while coupled-denitrification turned out to be a sink of N2O because of the presence of inner anaerobic region in sludge flocs.",

MWCNTs functionalized with carboxyl- and amine- groups on their surface were used as immobilization carriers. The immobilization of papain on the functionalized MWCNTs through physical absorption was examined. The conjugates were denoted as MWCNTs–papain bioconjugates. To improve the stability, the bioconjugates were further coated by silica through the biomimetic silicification process that induced by papain (denoted as silica-coated bioconjugates). The as-prepared MWCNTs–papain bioconjugates and the silica-coated bioconjugates were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The preliminary results showed that the bioconjugates could retain most of the initial activity of papain. Compared to free papain and MWCNTs–papain bioconjugates, the silica-coated bioconjugates exhibited significantly improved thermal, pH and recycling stability. Comparisons of the kinetic parameters between MWCNTs–papain bioconjugates and the silica-coated bioconjugates revealed that the Km value of the immobilized papain experienced a slight increase after silica coating, which suggested that the silica coating did not significantly hinder papain's access to substrate or release of product.",

     "abstract": "The aromatic polyketide antibiotic, oxytetracycline (OTC), is produced by Streptomyces rimosus as an important secondary metabolite. High level production of antibiotics in Streptomycetes requires precursors and cofactors which are derived from primary metabolism; therefore it is exigent to engineer the primary metabolism. This has been demonstrated by targeting a key enzyme in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) generation, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), which is encoded by zwf1 and zwf2. Disruption of zwf1 or zwf2 resulted in a higher production of OTC. The disrupted strain had an increased carbon flux through glycolysis and a decreased carbon flux through PPP, as measured by the enzyme activities of G6PDH and phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), and by the levels of ATP, which establishes G6PDH as a key player in determining carbon flux distribution. The increased production of OTC appeared to be largely due to the generation of more malonyl-CoA, one of the OTC precursors, as observed in the disrupted mutants. We have studied the effect of zwf modification on metabolite levels, gene expression, and secondary metabolite production to gain greater insight into flux distribution and the link between the fluxes in the primary and secondary metabolisms.",

All tested polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were oxidized by MnP in the presence of Mn(II) ions but the rate of their oxidation was not directly related to degree of their unsaturation. As it has been shown by monitoring oxygen consumption and conjugated dienes formation the linoleic acid was the most easily oxidizable fatty acid for MnP/Mn(II) and chelated Mn(III). However, when the lipid peroxidation (LPO) activity was monitored by TBARS formation the linolenic acid gave the highest results. High accumulation of TBARS was also recorded during peroxidation of linoleic acid initiated by MnP/Mn(II). Action of Mn(III)-tartrate on the PUFAs mimics action of MnP in the presence of Mn(II) indicating that Mn(III) ions are involved in LPO initiation. Although in our experiments Mn(III) tartrate gave faster than MnP/Mn(II) initial oxidation of the unsaturated fatty acids with consumption of O2 and formation of conjugated dienes the process was not productive and did not support further development of LPO. The higher effectiveness of MnP/Mn(II)-initiated LPO system depends on the turnover of manganese provided by MnP. It is proposed that the oxygen consumption assay is the best express method for evaluation of MnP- and Mn(III)-initiated peroxidation of C18 unsaturated fatty acids.",

To obtain an immobilized cellulase with high hydrolytic activity, the immobilization conditions including activation time, enzyme concentration, immobilization time, and temperature were optimized. Under those conditions, the immobilized cellulase possessed a protein loading of 30 mg/g-support and a specific activity of 3.2 U/mg-protein. After immobilization, the enzymatic stability of cellulase against pH and thermal stresses was improved. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements also revealed that the cellulase was covalently bonded to the supports. The immobilized cellulase was then used to hydrolyze cell wall of microalgae for the production of reducing sugars. Analyses using response surface methodology (RSM) show that the hydrolysis yield was affected by the reaction temperature, pH, and substrate/cellulase mass ratio, and a hydrolysis yield of 60.86% could be obtained at 47.85 °C, pH 5.82, and a substrate/cellulase mass ratio of 40 g-substrate/g-cellulase.

To prevent undesirable leakage of immobilized enzyme away from the support, the ionic preparations were cross-linked with aldehyde dextran (MW 20 kDa) and the influence of the dextran oxidation degree on the resulting biocatalyst activity was evaluated. Although in all cases the percentage of expressed activity after immobilization drastically decreased (≤25%), this procedure allowed to obtain an active catalyst which resulted up to 6-fold and 3-fold more stable than the soluble (non immobilized) enzyme and the just adsorbed (non cross-linked) counterpart, respectively, at pH 10 and 37 °C. No release of the enzyme from the support could be observed. Covalent immobilization on aldehyde or epoxy supports was generally detrimental for enzyme activity.

The phosphorylases from family GH-112 are exceptional because they employ galactose-1-phosphate instead of glucose-1-phosphate as glycosyl donor. Different acceptor specificities have been observed in this family, ranging from l-rhamnose to GlcNAc, GalNAc and a combination of the latter. Three new phosphorylases from previously unexplored branches of the phylogenetic tree of family GH-112 have now been characterized to shed more light on this divergence in acceptor specificity. The enzymes from Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and Streptobacillus moniliformis were found to prefer GalNAc as acceptor, while that from Anaerococcus prevotii displays similar activities on GalNAc and GlcNAc. These results confirm the correlation between the amino acid residue at position 162 and the enzyme's specificity, i.e. a threonine in the former group and a valine in the latter. However, mutagenesis of residue 162 did not allow the rational transformation of the substrate preference, as the substitution of valine by threonine in the enzyme from Bifidobacterium longum did not tighten its specificity towards GalNAc. Unexpectedly, introducing an isoleucine at position 162 increased the preference for GlcNAc as acceptor, which illustrates that the structure–function relationships in β-galactoside phosphorylases are not yet completely understood. Several other positions have also been examined by mutational analysis but true determinants of the acceptor specificity in family GH-112 could not be identified.",

In this study, probiotic Bacillus spores were explored as a matrix for immobilizing Escherichia coli phytase, a feed enzyme releasing phosphate from phytate. Because Bacillus spore is inherently resistant to heat, solvents and drying, they were expected to be a unique matrix for enzyme immobilization. When mixed with food-grade Bacillus polyfermenticus spores, phytases were adsorbed to their surface and became immobilized. The amount of phytase attached was 28.2 ± 0.7 mg/g spores, corresponding to a calculated activity of 63,960 U/g spores; however, the measured activity was 41,120 ± 990.1 U/g spores, reflecting a loss of activity upon adsorption. Immobilization increased the half life (t1/2) of the enzyme three- to ten-fold at different temperatures ranging from 60 to 90 °C. Phytase was bound to the spore surface to the extent that ultrasonication treatment was not able to detach phytases from spores. Desorption of spore-immobilized phytase was only achieved by treatment with 1 M NaCl, 10% formic acid in 45% acetonitrile, SDS, or urea, suggesting that adsorption of phytase to the spore might be via hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. We propose here that Bacillus spore is a novel immobilization matrix for enzymes that displays high binding capacity and provides food-grade safety.",

Sequence analysis revealed that the bglU contained an open reading frame of 1419 bp and encoded a protein of 472 amino acid residues. Based on its putative catalytic domains, BglU was classified as a member of the glycosyl hydrolase family 1 (GH1). BglU possessed lower arginine content and Arg/(Arg + Lys) ratio than mesophilic GH1 β-glucosidases. Recombinant BglU was purified with Ni2+ affinity chromatography and subjected to enzymatic characterization. SDS-PAGE and native staining showed that it was a monomeric protein with an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa. BglU was particularly thermolabile since its half-life time was only 30 min at 30 °C and it exhibited maximal activity at 25 °C and pH 6.5. Recombinant BglU could hydrolyze a wide range of aryl-β-glucosides and β-linked oligosaccharides with highest activity towards cellobiose and then p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG). Under the optimal conditions with pNPG as substrate, the Km and kcat were 7 mmol/L and 7.85 × 103/s, respectively.

B. subtilis spores expressing laccase exhibited maximal activity for the oxidation of 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) at pH 4.0 and 80 °C, and for the decolorization of indigo carmine at pH 8.0 and 60 °C.

Recently, we reported the development of an industrial xylose-fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, MA-R4, which was engineered by chromosomal integration to express the genes encoding xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase from Pichia stipitis along with S. cerevisiae xylulokinase gene constitutively using the alcohol-fermenting flocculent yeast strain, IR-2. IR-2 has the highest xylulose-fermenting ability of the industrial diploid strains, making it a useful host strain for genetically engineering xylose-utilizing S. cerevisiae. To optimize the activities of xylose metabolizing enzymes in the metabolic engineering of IR-2 for further improvement of ethanol production from xylose, we constructed a set of recombinant isogenic strains harboring different combinations of genetic modifications present in MA-R4, and investigated the effect of constitutive expression of xylulokinase and of different levels of xylulokinase and xylose reductase activity on xylose fermentation. This strain comparison showed that constitutive expression of xylulokinase increased ethanol production from xylose at the expense of xylitol excretion, and that high activity of xylose reductase resulted in an increased rate of xylose consumption and an increased glycerol yield. Moreover, strain MA-R6, which has moderate xylulokinase activity, grew slightly better but accumulated more xylitol than strain MA-R4. These results suggest that fine-tuning of introduced enzyme activity in S. cerevisiae is important for improving xylose fermentation to ethanol.",

Despite this, successful n-dodecane oxidation for the production of 1-dodecanol or dodecanoic acid has proven elusive in the past when using alkB-expressing recombinants. This article demonstrates, for the first time in vivo, by using the Escherichia coli GEC137 pGEc47ΔJ strain, that n-dodecane oxidation using this enzyme for the production of primary alcohols and carboxylic acids is feasible and in fact potentially more promising than n-octane oxidation due to lower product and substrate toxicity. Yields are reported of 1-dodecanol of up to 2 g/Lorganic and dodecanoic acid up to 19.7 g/Lorganic in a 2 L stirred tank reactor with 1 L aqueous phase and 200 mL of n-dodecane as a second phase. The maximum volumetric rate of combined alcohol and acid production achieved was 1.9 g/Lorganic/h (0.35 g/Ltotal/h). The maximum specific activity of combined alcohol and acid production was 7-fold lower on n-dodecane (3.5 μmol/min/gdcw) than on n-octane (21 μmol/min/gdcw); similar to the 5-fold difference observed between wild-type growth rates using the two respective alkanes as sole carbon source. Despite this, both total volumetric rate and final yield exceeded n-octane oxidation by 3.5-fold under the same conditions, due to the lower toxicity of n-dodecane and its oxidation products to E. coli compared to the 8-carbon equivalents. Substrate access limitations and the overoxidation of 1-dodecanol to dodecanoic acid were identified as the most important limitations to be addressed.",

The enzyme catalyzed the synthesis of medium- and long-chain fatty acid cholesterol esters, but failed to synthesize short-chain fatty acid esters. The fatty acid specificities in the synthesis and hydrolysis of cholesterol esters were entirely different from each other. Unlike other lipolytic enzymes, the enzyme was largely independent of water content in the synthesis of cholesterol oleate, and it achieved near-complete esterification in the presence of an equimolar excess of oleic acid. Of additional interest is the finding that the addition of n-hexane markedly enhanced the esterification activities on all the medium- and long-chain saturated fatty acids used.

However, the ethanol yield remained unchanged due to increased by-product formation. Metabolic flux analysis suggested that the expression of the Gxf1 transporter had shifted the control of xylose catabolism from transport to the NAD+ dependent oxidation of xylitol to xylulose.",

It was found that pH has a significant effect on the adsorption of lactic acid on AC. The use of AC for in situ removal of lactic acid successfully decreased the inhibitory effect of lactic acid, resulting in significant increases in both productivity and yield. Acetone was used to desorb lactic acid and it was confirmed that the acetone treatment did not decrease the optical purity of the lactic acid, i.e., the optical purity was as high as 99.5% after desorption. Due to the presence of little materials influencing lactic acid oligomerization, oligomers with an optical purity of above 96% and a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 2400 were obtained in the oligomerization process.",

PSA–CaCl2 hydrogel systems were compared to systems involving covalent cross-linking of PSA with glycidylmethacrylate (PSA–GMA) which was confirmed with Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) analysis. Incubation of PSA–CaCl2 and PSA–GMA beads loaded with Alizarin as a model ingredient with trigger enzymes (polygalacturonases or pectate lyases) or bacteria lead to a smoothening of the surface and exposure of Alizarin according to Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) analysis. Enzyme triggered release of Alizarin was demonstrated for a commercial enzyme preparation from Aspergillus niger and with purified polygalacturonase and pectate lyase from S. rolfsii and B. pumilus, respectively. In contrast to the PSA–CaCl2 beads, cross-linking (PSA–GMA beads) restricted the release of Alizarin in absence of enzymes. There was a linear relation between release of Alizarin (5–348 μM) and enzyme activity in a range of 0–300 U ml−1 dosed. In addition to enzymes, both PSA–CaCl2 and PSA–GMA beads were incubated with Bacillus subtilis and Yersinia entercolitica as model contaminating microorganism. After 72 h, a release between 10 μM and 57 μM Alizarin was detected. For protection of the hydrogels, an enzymatically modified PET membrane was covalently attached onto the surface. This lead to a slower release and improve long term storage stability based on less than 1% release of dye after 21 days. Additionally, this allowed simple detection by visual inspection of the device due to a colour change of the white membrane to orange upon enzyme triggered release of the dye.",

The conversion of substrates ranged from 60% to 90% and the highest conversion was observed for the iodolactone with an unsubstituted cyclohexane ring (4a). The products were fully characterized by the spectroscopic methods and for the hydroxylactone with gem-dimethyl group at C-5 (5c) and hydroxylactone with trimethylcyclohexane system (5d) the crystal structures were obtained. The main products formed in the process of hydrolytic dehalogenation were δ-hydroxy-γ-lactones (5a–d) with the hydroxy group located cis in relation to lactone moiety. In case of lactone with 4,4,6-trimethylcyclohexane system (4d) the dehydrohalogenation followed by the epoxidation of double bond was also observed. One of the metabolites 4,5-epoxy-2,2,6-trimethyl-9-oxabicyclo[4.3.0]nonan-8-one (8) was formed in the sequence of three reactions: hydroxylation at C-5, translactonization and intramolecular nucleophilic substitution of the iodine by the hydroxy group. Some of the isolated products of transformation of the iodolactone with trimethylcyclohexane system (4d) were obtained as the single enantiomers (5d, 7, and 8).

When Saccharomyces cerevisiae displaying Rhizopus oryzae lipase was used for esterification in n-hexane, equilibrating the dried cells with water prior to the reaction markedly increased the reaction rate. An equilibration of the cells with various saturated salt solutions showed that the reaction rate increased with increasing aw of the salt solution, to give the best performance at aw of 1.0. Interestingly, this trend was extremely different from those of lipases in powder or resin-immobilized form. To determine whether the cell surface is responsible for the unique aw profiles, an investigation was carried out similarly using other lipase sources and yeast strains, which indicated that, in all the cells examined, a higher aw resulted in a higher reaction rate. Moreover, increasing aw was found to increase the cell surface hydrophobicity determined by an aqueous-hydrocarbon biphasic partitioning assay. These results indicate that lipases displayed on yeast cells show a unique aw dependence probably because of the variation in cell surface characteristics.",

This reactor configuration enables both enzymes, involved in the cascade reaction, to work with optimized kinetics, without any purification, exploiting their differing temperature dependences. To this end, the first CSMR, optimized for the properties of the NHase, was operated (i) at low temperature (5 °C), limiting inactivation of the more fragile enzyme, nitrile hydratase, (ii) with a high residence time (24 h) to overcome reaction rate limitation. The second CSMR, optimized for the properties of the AMase, was operated (i) at a higher temperature (50 °C), (ii) with a lower residence time (6 h), and (iii) with a lower substrate (3-cyanopyridine) concentration to control excess substrate inhibition. The appropriate choice of operational conditions enabled total conversion of 3-cyanpyridine (up to 200 mM) into nicotinic acid to be achieved at steady-state and for long periods. Higher substrate concentrations required two CSMRs optimized for the properties of the NHase arranged in series to drive the first reaction to completion.",

     "abstract": "A study of the dynamic response of a microbial fuel cell (MFC) using membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) designed for air breathing cathode operation is reported. The MFC used four MEAs simultaneously and has a low internal resistance. An increased concentration of glucose produced a non-linear increase in the maximum current reached. The time to reach the maximum current increased with increasing glucose concentrations of 1–7 mM; varying from approximately 2.4 to 4.2 h. The rate at which the current density increased with time was the same for all glucose concentrations up to current densities close to the maximum values. The peak power density varied approximately linearly with glucose concentrations from 2 to 77 mW/m2 (1–7 mM) with a 1 kΩ resistance. The cell response appeared to be linked to a slow process of fuel transport to the bacteria and their metabolic processes. The dynamic response of the anode was analysed in terms of a substrate mass transport model. The application of different current ranges did not significantly change the dynamic response of either the anode community or the MFC polarization characteristics. Thus, it is likely that the bacterial communities that form under MFC operation contain sufficiently “dominant” electro-active species that are capable of producing high power for MFCs.",

Toxic and inhibitory compounds will vary with pretreatment and include soluble sugars, furan derivatives (hydroxymethyl fulfural, furfural), organic acids (acetic, formic and, levulinic acid), and phenolic compounds. Their effect is seen when an increase in the concentration of pretreated biomass in a hydrolysis slurry results in decreased cellulose conversion, even though the ratio of enzyme to cellulose is kept constant. We used lignin-free cellulose, Solka Floc, combined with mixtures of soluble components released during pretreatment of wood, to prove that the decrease in the rate and extent of cellulose hydrolysis is due to a combination of enzyme inhibition and deactivation. The causative agents were extracted from wood pretreatment liquid using PEG surfactant, activated charcoal or ethyl acetate and then desorbed, recovered, and added back to a mixture of enzyme and cellulose. At enzyme loadings of either 1 or 25 mg protein/g glucan, the most inhibitory components, later identified as phenolics, decreased the rate and extent of cellulose hydrolysis by half due to both inhibition and precipitation of the enzymes. Full enzyme activity occurred when the phenols were removed. Hence detoxification of pretreated woods through phenol removal is expected to reduce enzyme loadings, and therefore reduce enzyme costs, for a given level of cellulose conversion.",

     "abstract": "Many industries are currently pursuing enzymatic approaches for developing green chemistry technologies mainly due to shortcomings of physico-chemical methods, growing environmental concerns, legal restrictions, and increasing scientific knowledge. Laccase-assisted reactions, in particular, are being intensively investigated as they are generally eco-friendly and have wide application potential. Laccases only require oxygen as co-substrate, they release water as the only by-product and have a wide substrate range which can be further extended by use of laccase–mediator systems. Consequently, research covering various applications of laccase has been rapidly increasing in recent years, particularly in the areas of coupling and grafting reactions. This review summarizes the advances that have been made in developing technologies based on laccase-mediated coupling and grafting reactions for potential application in areas such as environmental pollution control, modification of lignocellulose materials, food industry, biosensors, textile industry, pharmaceutical industry, and in organic synthesis.",

In Period-I, almost all of the formaldehyde entered the assimilatory pathway, at MS-0.02 and MS-0.03, whereas, at MS-0.04 high methanol feeding rate resulted in an adaptation problem. In Period-III, only at MS-0.02 co-carbon source sorbitol uptake-flux was active showing that sorbitol uptake does not affected from the predetermined feeding rate of methanol at μ0 > 0.02 h−1.

The transformant produced elevated levels of phosphoglucomutase activity compared to the wild type, a fact that facilitated the subsequent purification procedure. The enzyme (FoPGM) was purified to homogeneity applying three anion exchange and one gel filtration chromatography steps. The native enzyme revealed a monomeric structure with a molecular mass of 60 kDa, while the isoelectric point was 3.5. FoPGM was active in pH ranged from 6.0 to 8.0, with an optimum using 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid buffer at 7.0, while loss of activity was observed when phosphate buffer was used in the above mentioned pH range. The optimal temperature for activity was 45 °C but the enzyme became unstable at temperatures above 40 °C. FoPGM requires the presence of a divalent cation for its function with maximum activity being obtained with Co2+. The apparent Km for Co2+ was found to be 10 μM. The enzyme was also active with other divalent metal ions such as Mn2+, Mg2+, Ni2+ and Ca2+ but to a lesser extent.

The spore-displayed β-Gal was found to be stable when an amphiphilic 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) was used as a co-solvent; the transgalactosylation efficiency and octyl-gal conversion were optimal at 50% (v/v) DME. In addition, the product was maximally obtained from 100 mM lactose in a phosphate buffer/n-octanol/DME (25/25/50, v/v) mixture. By increasing the agitation speed and the amount of spores displaying β-Gal, a yield of 33.7 mM octyl-gal was obtained over 24 h in a batch mode, which is much higher than in other octyl-gal bioconversion processes, such as those involving lipid-coating, reverse micelles, or whole cells. On the other hand, intermittent addition of spore-displayed β-Gal and/or lactose in the reaction medium had no effect on the octyl-gal yield. The synthesized octyl-gal was hydrolyzed by the spore-displayed β-Gal, and a high concentration of octyl-gal competitively inhibited the enzymes (Ki value of 10.8 mM). In summary, we demonstrate that octyl-gal synthesis by spore-displayed β-Gal in non-aqueous medium can be significantly improved with the use of DME as a co-solvent.",

     "abstract": "Phenolics derived from lignin and other plant components can pose significant inhibition on enzymatic conversion of cellulosic biomass materials to useful chemicals. Understanding the mechanism of such inhibition is of importance for the development of viable biomass conversion technologies. In native plant cell wall, most of the phenolics and derivatives are found in polymeric lignin. When biomass feedstocks are pretreated (prior to enzymatic hydrolysis), simple or oligomeric phenolics and derivatives are often generated from lignin modification/degradation, which can inhibit biomass-converting enzymes. To further understand how such phenolic substances may affect cellulase reaction, we carried out a comparative study on a series of simple and oligomeric phenolics representing or mimicking the composition of lignin or its degradation products. Consistent to previous studies, we observed that oligomeric phenolics could exert more inhibition on enzymatic cellulolysis than simple phenolics. Oligomeric phenolics could inactivate cellulases by reversibly complexing them. Simple and oligomeric phenolics could also inhibit enzymatic cellulolysis by adsorbing onto cellulose. Individual cellulases showed different susceptibility toward these inhibitions. Polyethylene glycol and tannase could respectively bind and degrade the studied oligomeric phenolics, and by doing so mitigate the oligomeric phenolic's inhibition on cellulolysis.",

In a flat-panel photobioreactor that was operated as a turbidostat cell numbers of stressed cells were kept constant while attaining a continuous well-defined light-stress. In this way it was possible to study the balance between cell growth and cell death and determine whether both could be increased to reach higher volumetric productivities of carotenoids.In the two-phase system a volumetric productivity of 8.3 mg β-carotene LRV−1 d−1 was obtained. In situ extraction contributed only partly to this productivity. The major part came from net production of carotenoid-rich biomass, due to a high growth rate of the cells and subsequent dilution of the reactor. To reach equilibrium between cell growth and cell death, sparging rates of dodecane could have been increased. However, already at the applied sparging rate of 286 Ldod LRV−1 min−1 emulsion formation of the dodecane in the aqueous phase appeared.In a turbidostat without in situ extraction a volumetric productivity of 13.5 mg β-carotene LRV−1 d−1 was reached, solely based on the continuous production of carotenoid-rich biomass.",

The pulA gene from T. neapolitana showed 91.5% pairwise amino acid identity with pulA from Thermotoga maritima and contained the four regions conserved in all amylolytic enzymes. pulA encodes a protein of 843 amino acids with a 19-residue signal peptide. The pulA gene was subcloned and overexpressed in E. coli under the control of the T7 promoter. The purified recombinant enzyme (rPulA) produced a 93-kDa protein with pullulanase activity. rPulA was optimally active at pH 5–7 and 80 °C and had a half-life of 88 min at 80 °C. rPulA hydrolyzed pullulan, producing maltotriose, and hydrolytic activities were also detected with amylopectin, starch, and glycogen, but not with amylose. This substrate specificity is typical of a type I pullulanase. Thin layer chromatography of the reaction products in the reaction with pullulan and aesculin showed that the enzyme had transglycosylation activity. Analysis of the transfer product using NMR and isoamylase treatment revealed it to be α-maltotriosyl-(1,6)-aesculin, suggesting that the enzyme transferred the maltotriosyl residue of pullulan to aesculin by forming α-1,6-glucosidic linkages. Our findings suggest that the pullulanase from T. neapolitana is the first thermostable type I pullulanase which has α-1,6-transferring activity.",

The native enzyme was shown to have a molecular mass of 53 kDa, an N-terminal amino acid sequence characteristically seen in laccases and an isoelectric point of pH 3.8. The enzyme accepts typical laccase substrates including 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), syringaldazine and guaiacol, but has no tyrosinase activity. The pH optimum is at pH 3.0 for ABTS and at 6.0 for syringaldazine and the enzyme is stable up to pH 10. The UV/vis spectrum of the laccase-related enzyme is non-typical for laccases and metal content analysis revealed that the enzyme contains only a single copper atom per enzyme molecule. This suggests that this enzyme could be related to the group of the so-called “white” laccases, however, no zinc or any other metal ion could be detected in this enzyme, suggesting that the enzyme is a unique laccase-related enzyme.

     "abstract": "Mutagenesis and immobilization are usually considered to be unrelated techniques with potential applications to improve protein properties. However, there are several reports showing that the use of site-directed mutagenesis to improve enzyme properties directly, but also how enzymes are immobilized on a support, can be a powerful tool to improve the properties of immobilized biomolecules for use as biosensors or biocatalysts. Standard immobilizations are not fully random processes, but the protein orientation may be difficult to alter. Initially, most efforts using this idea were addressed towards controlling the orientation of the enzyme on the immobilization support, in many cases to facilitate electron transfer from the support to the enzyme in redox biosensors. Usually, Cys residues are used to directly immobilize the protein on a support that contains disulfide groups or that is made from gold. There are also some examples using His in the target areas of the protein and using supports modified with immobilized metal chelates and other tags (e.g., using immobilized antibodies). Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis to control immobilization is useful for improving the activity, the stability and even the selectivity of the immobilized protein, for example, via site-directed rigidification of selected areas of the protein. Initially, only Cys and disulfide supports were employed, but other supports with higher potential to give multipoint covalent attachment are being employed (e.g., glyoxyl or epoxy-disulfide supports). The advances in support design and the deeper knowledge of the mechanisms of enzyme–support interactions have permitted exploration of the possibilities of the coupled use of site-directed mutagenesis and immobilization in a new way. This paper intends to review some of the advances and possibilities that these coupled strategies permit.",

Some of the reported polygalacturonase assays measure the activity by detecting the appearance of reducing ends such as the Somogyi–Nelson method. As a result of being general towards reducing groups, the Somogyi–Nelson method is not appropriate when studying polygalacturonase and polygalacturonase inhibitors in plant crude extracts, which often have a strong reducing power. Ruthenium Red is an inorganic dye that binds polygalacturonic acid and causes its precipitation. In the presence of polygalacturonase, polygalacturonic acid is hydrolyzed bringing about a corresponding gain in soluble Ruthenium Red. The described assay utilizes Ruthenium Red as the detection reagent which has been used previously in plate-based assays but not in liquid medium reactions. The new method measures the disappearance of the substrate polygalacturonic acid and is compared to the Somogyi–Nelson assay. The experimental results using lemon peel, a fern fronds and castor leaf crude extracts demonstrate that the new method provides a way to the quickly screening of polygalacturonase activity and polygalacturonase inhibitors in plant crude extracts containing high amounts of reducing power. On the other hand, the Ruthenium Red assay is not able to determine the activity of an exo-polygalacturonase as initial velocity and thus would allow the differentiation between endo- and exo-polygalacturonase activities.",

The results showed that mean total nitrogen (TN) removal was only about 47% and phosphorus removal was almost zero without the pre-anoxic zone and additional carbon source. Contrastively, with configuration of pre-anoxic zone, TN and phosphorus removal was increased to 75% and 98%, respectively, as well as denitrifying phosphorus removal of 66–91% occurred in the anoxic zone. Nitritation–denitritation was achieved through a combination of short aerobic actual hydraulic retention time and low dissolved oxygen levels (0.3–0.5 mg/L); however, phosphorus removal deteriorated with increase of nitrite accumulation rates. The free nitrous acid (FNA) concentration of 0.002–0.003 mg HNO2–N/L in the aerobic zone inhibited phosphorus uptake, which was major cause of phosphorus removal deterioration. Through supplying the carbon sources to enhance denitrification and anaerobic phosphorus release, nitrite and FNA concentrations in the aerobic zone were reduced, and phosphorus removal was improved. Compared with nitrification–denitrification, nitritation–denitritation reduced the carbon requirement by 30% and performed biological nutrients removal well with mean TN and phosphorus removal of 85% and 96%, respectively.",

Southern hybridization and PCR-based assay definitely confirmed that the ldh gene in the Δldh mutant was disrupted by the insertion of the erythromycin resistance gene. Compared with the wild type, the Δldh mutant exhibited increases of 31.0% and 31.4% in cell yield under glucose and xylose cultivation, respectively, probably because knocking out the ldh gene results in increased acetate and ATP levels. Knockout of lactate dehydrogenase produced 2.37- and 2.1-fold increases in the yield of ethanol (mole/mole substrate) under glucose and xylose cultivation, respectively. Moreover, no lactic acid was detected in Δldh mutant fermentation mixtures (detection limit of HPLC: 0.5 mM), but lactic acid was readily detected for growth of the wild-type strain on both glucose and xylose, with final concentrations up to 59.24 mM and 56.06 mM, respectively.

Here, we investigated the production of cellulases by using rice straw subjected to various pretreatments as substrates in order to produce cellulases at low costs; we also identified the enzymes’ characteristics. Rice straw cutter milled to <3 mm was pretreated by wet disk milling, dry ball milling, or hot-compressed water treatment (HCWT). Pretreated rice straw and commercial cellulose, Solka Floc (SF), were used as carbon sources for cellulase production by the fungus Acremonium cellulolyticus. Filter paper cellulase, β-xylanase, and β-xylosidase production from ball- and disk-milled samples were higher than those from SF. Enzymatic activity was absent in cultures where HCWT rice straw was used as carbon source. Wet disk-milled rice straw cultures were more suitable for enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated rice straw than SF cultures. Thus, wet disk milling may be a suitable pretreatment for producing substrates for enzymatic hydrolysis and generating inexpensive carbon sources for cellulase production.",

     "abstract": "Selective and effective separation can potentially be achieved with affinity foam fractionation using simple foaming setup and operation. In this study the use of affinity foam fractionation for selective collection and enrichment of β-glucosidase from a cellulase enzyme mixture was evaluated. Rhamnolipids, a group of glycolipids produced most commonly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were used as the affinity foaming agent, because of their foaming property and the presence of dirhamnose moiety (a potential substrate analog for β-glucosidase) in some rhamnolipids. The effects of aeration rate, medium pH, cellulase concentration and rhamnolipid concentration on the foam fractionation performance were examined. Among the pH studied (3.1, 5.0, 7.0 and 9.0), pH 5 was clearly the optimal for selective enrichment of β-glucosidase, presumably corresponding to the high binding affinity between the enzyme and the substrate analog (dirhamnose). With adequate rhamnolipid concentrations (≥0.1 g/L), the aeration rate of 0.1 L/min (i.e., 2 VVM) for 50 ml test samples was found to give the highest enrichment; higher aeration rates produced wetter foam and, thus, lower (diluted) enzyme activity in the foamate. The enrichment increased with the increasing rhamnolipids-to-cellulase ratio, in the range of 0–2 (w/w) investigated in this study. The finding indicated that rhamnolipids were the limiting compounds in these systems so that the amount of surfactant–enzyme complexes formed and removed into the foam phase would increase when more rhamnolipids were added. At the rhamnolipids-to-cellulase ratio of 2, the β-glucosidase activity in the foamate was about 9 times as high as the activity in the original sample of cellulase mixture and about 17 times the activity in the remaining solution (after foaming). The overall FPU (filter paper unit, a measurement of total cellulase activity) and the activities of endo- and exo-glucanases were only enriched 70–150%. The feasibility of affinity foam fractionation was demonstrated.",

Metabolic analysis showed that the increase of the total hydrogen yield was attributed to the improvement of NADH pathway. The result of more reductive cellular oxidation state balance also further demonstrated that, under proper initial microaerophilic conditions and by PPK overexpression, the cell could adjust the cellular redox states and make more energy flow into hydrogen production pathways.",

Furthermore, glucose deprivation is made by strain HSD07A, and NMR and GC data reveal that the yeast can convert glucose into glycerol and ethanol. G. lucidum cannot assimilate ethanol; however, glycerol is an efficient carbon source for G. lucidum. In the co-culture process, the appearance of the second carbon source, glycerol produced by the yeast, is the crucial reason why G. lucidum overproduces laccase because glycerol can make G. lucidum cells secrete more laccase by prolonging the secretion time under the condition of glucose deprivation. Thus, it is the carbon source succession in the co-culture process that leads to the overproduction of G. lucidum laccase.",

Bac-ME effectively transduced HeLa cells with minimal leaky expression, but expressed EGFP robustly upon induction with ZnSO4, hence allowing for virus titration by transducing HeLa cells with serially diluted virus, subsequent ZnSO4 induction and flow cytometry analysis of EGFP-positive cells. The titration protocol enabled the generation of discernable titration curves, determination of transducing titers, and discrimination of the transducing abilities of different virus batches. After titration, cell transduction with pre-determined Bac-ME dose revealed consistent transduction efficiency dependence on the dose, regardless of virus batch and cell type. Bac-MECB was similarly titrated by inducible EGFP expression and used to transduce de-differentiated articular chondrocytes without EGFP induction. BMP-2 expression was proportional to the Bac-MECB dose and promoted cartilage-specific matrix synthesis, implicating the potential of Bac-MECB in restoring chondrocyte differentiation. These data confirmed that regulatable EGFP expression enabled rapid, reliable baculovirus titration without interference with subsequent applications.",

Its low aqueous solubility facilitates product recovery. To avoid excessive waste salt production during downstream processing, a low pH for fumaric acid fermentation will be beneficial. Studying the influence of pH, working volume and shaking frequency on cell cultivation helped us to identify the best conditions to obtain appropriate pellet morphologies of a wild type strain of Rhizopus oryzae. Using these pellets, the effects of pH and CO2 addition were studied to determine the best conditions to produce fumaric acid in batch fermentations under nitrogen-limited conditions with glucose as carbon source. Decreasing either the fermentation pH below 5 or increasing the CO2 content of the inlet air above 10% was unfavourable for the cell-specific productivity, fumaric acid yield, and fumaric acid titer. However, switching off the pH control late in the batch phase did not affect these performance parameters and allowed achieving pH of 3.6. A concentration of 20 g L−1 of fumaric acid was obtained at pH 3.6 while the average cell mass specific productivity and fumaric acid yield were the same as at pH 5.0. Consequently, relatively modest amounts of inorganic base were required for pH control, while recovery of the acid should be relatively easy at pH 3.6.",

We report the identification of phenols with major inhibition and/or deactivation effect on enzymes used for conversion of cellulose to ethanol. The inhibition effects were measured by combining the inhibitors (phenols) with enzyme and substrate immediately at the beginning of the assay. The deactivation effects were determined by pre-incubating phenols with cellulases or β-glucosidases for specified periods of time, prior to the respective enzyme assays. Tannic, gallic, hydroxy-cinnamic, and 4-hydroxybenzoic acids, together with vanillin caused 20–80% deactivation of cellulases and/or β-glucosidases after 24 h of pre-incubation while enzymes pre-incubated in buffer alone retained all of their activity. The strength of the inhibition or deactivation effect depended on the type of enzyme, the microorganism from which the enzyme was derived, and the type of phenolic compounds present. β-Glucosidase from Aspergillus niger was the most resistant to inhibition and deactivation, requiring about 5 and 10-fold higher concentrations, respectively, for the same levels of inhibition or deactivation as observed for enzymes from Trichoderma reesei. Of the phenol molecules tested, tannic acid was the single, most damaging aromatic compound that caused both deactivation and reversible loss (inhibition) of all of enzyme activities tested.",

     "abstract": "Enzymatic transesterification of triglycerides in a continuous way is always a great challenge with a large field of applications for biodiesel, bio-lubricant, bio-surfactant, etc. productions. The lipase B from Candida antarctica (CalB) is the most appreciated enzyme because of its high activity and its non-regio-selectivity toward positions of fatty acid residues on glycerol backbone of triglycerides. Nevertheless, in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, we demonstrated that the medium hydrophilic nature of the support used for its commercial form (Lewatit VPOC1600) is a limitation. Glycerol is adsorbed onto support inducing drastic decrease in enzyme activity. Glycerol would form a hydrophilic layer around the enzyme resulting in diffusional limitations during triglyceride transfer to the enzyme. Accurel MP, a very hydrophobic macroporous polymer of propylene, was found not to adsorb glycerol. Immobilization conditions using this support were optimized. The best support was Accurel MP1001 (particle size < 1000 μm) and a pre-treatment of the support with acetone instead of ethanol enables the adsorption rate and the immobilized enzyme quantity to be maximized.An economical approach (maximization of the process net present value) was expanded in order to explore the impact of immobilization on development of an industrial packed bed reactor. The crucial ratio between the quantity of lipase and the quantity of support, taking into account enzyme, support and equipped packed bed reactor costs was optimized in this sense. The biocatalyst cost was found as largely the main cost centre (2–10 times higher than the investments for the reactor vessel). In consequence, optimal conditions for immobilization were a compromise between this immobilization yield (90% of lipase immobilized), biocatalyst activity, reactor volume and total investments.",

The degradation was monitored by gel permeation chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Maximum degradation (ca. 60% reduction in Mn) of BPAPC was observed in THF with PPL when compared to the control without the enzyme. The degradation products in all the experiments were bisphenol-A and 4-α-cumyl phenol suggesting that the lipases act through an end-chain scission on the polymer. The degradation of BPAPC in THF was in the order of PPL > CAL > CRL, while in CHCl3 it was CRL > CAL > PPL. To understand this disparity, and to probe the mechanistic aspects of degradation, molecular dynamics investigations were performed on the lipases with model BPAPC in both the solvents.

     "abstract": "An easy procedure for cell free biotransformation of pineapple juice sugars into dietetic derivatives was accomplished using a commercial invertase and an oxidoreductase from Zymomonas mobilis. First, pineapple juice sucrose was quantitatively converted into glucose and fructose by invertase, thus increasing the concentration of each monosaccharide in the original juice to almost twice. In a second step, glucose–fructose oxidoreductase (GFOR) transformed glucose into gluconolactone, and fructose into the low calorie sweetener sorbitol. The advantage of using GFOR is simultaneous reduction of fructose and oxidation of glucose, allowing the continuous regeneration of the essential coenzyme NADP(H), that is tightly bound to the enzyme. The yield of GFOR catalyzed sugar conversion depends on initial pH and control of pH during the reaction. At optimal conditions (pH control at 6.2) a maximum of 80% (w/v) sugar conversion was obtained. Without pH control, GFOR is inactivated rapidly due to gluconic acid formation. Therefore, conversion yields are relatively low at the natural pH of pineapple juice. The application of this process might be more advantageous on juices of other tropical fruits (papaya, jackfruit, mango) due to their naturally given higher pH.",

Two chemically pretreated wood substrates and one commercial bleached kraft hardwood pulp were used. Heat drying at 105 and 150 °C and air drying at 50% RH and 23.8 °C for different durations were applied to produce substrate with various degrees of hornification. It was found that substrate enzymatic digestibilities (SEDs) of hornified substrates made from the same never-dried sample correlate very well to an easily measurable parameter, water retention value (WRV), and can be fitted by a Boltzmann function. The hornification-produced SED reduction at a given degree of hornification as the percentage of the total SED reduction when the substrate is completely hornified depends on two parameters. The first is WRV ¯ , which is primarily a function of the effective enzyme molecule size, and Δ, which is related to the substrate pore size distribution shape. The low values of SEDCH, SED of a completely hornified substrate, obtained from curve fittings for the three sets of samples studied, suggest that enzyme accessibility to cellulose is mainly through the pores in the cell wall rather than substrate external surface. The SEDs of hornified substrates were found to correlate to Simons’ staining measurements well. A new parameter was proposed to better correlate enzyme accessibility to cellulose using the two-color Simons’ staining technique.",

Penicillium decumbens cellulase, a commercial cell wall-degrading enzyme with high transglycosylation activity, was found to offer far better performance in the extraction than Trichoderma reesei cellulase and Aspergillus niger pectinase under the presence of maltose as the glycosyl donor. TLC, HPLC and MS analysis indicated that P. decumbens cellulase could transglycosylate flavonol aglycones into more polar glucosides, the higher solubility of which led to improved extraction. The influence of glycosyl donor, pH, solvent and temperature on the enzymatic transglycosylation was investigated. For three predominant flavonoids in G. biloba, the transglycosylation showed similar optimal conditions, which were therefore used for the enzyme-assisted extraction. The extraction yield turned to be 28.3 mg/g of dw, 31% higher than that under the pre-optimized conditions, and 102% higher than that under the conditions without enzymes. The utilization of enzymatic bifunctionality described here, naming enzymatic modification of target compounds and facilitation of cell wall degradation, provides a novel approach for the extraction of natural compounds from plants.",

Firstly, formononetin was O-dealkylated into daidzein, which was subsequently mono-hydroxylated at the 3′-position of the B-ring into ortho-dihydroxy-isoflavone. Apparent kcat/Km values of CYP154 for the O-dealkylation of formononetin and the hydroxylation of daidzein were 3.57 and 1.84 μM−1 min−1, respectively. The dissociation constants of CYP154 based on spectral changes upon binding to each substrate were 5.16 and 3.11 μM, respectively. Homology modeling and docking simulation found that Thr247 is responsible for the 3′-position hydroxylation reaction by forming a hydrogen bond with the 4′-hydroxyl group of daidzein that forces the proton at the 3′-position to face the heme center. Site-directed mutagenesis of Thr247 to alanine drastically decreased the binding affinity for daidzein (9.73 μM) as well as 3′-position hydroxylation catalytic activity by 3 fold (0.48 μM−1 min−1).",

The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity by heat treatment and a glutathione-sepharose affinity column chromatography. The purified enzyme existed exclusively as a monomer in a native state. The optimum pH and temperature for this enzyme were 6.0 and 65 °C. The glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fusion enzyme had greater thermostability than thrombin-treated free enzyme. TmTreT had diverse substrate specificities. The enzyme effectively created a free trehalose from several nucleoside diphosphate (NDP)-glucoses as a donor and glucose as an acceptor. Inversely, the enzyme was also capable of employing several NDPs such as UDP, ADP, GDP, and CDP with trehalose to produce corresponding NDP-glucoses. The enzyme was able to employ other monosaccharides, such as mannose and fructose, as acceptors to synthesize disaccharide analogues of trehalose. The mannose-containing analogue was not hydrolyzed by trehalase and the rat intestinal enzymes. Furthermore, the analogue showed a competitive inhibition to the intestinal disaccharidases with Ki values of approximately 0.8–1.6 mM. The results suggest that the enzyme is an useful trehalose synthase that can regenerate NDP-glucoses from NDPs and produce the inhibitory trehalose analogues of indigestible disaccharides.",

This pattern was detected even in a sample with non-detectable mass loss.

Experimental evidences were obtained from batch reactor operation where increase in enzyme load and particle size has a much stronger impact on the former reaction. Additional evidences were obtained by the impact of the above biocatalyst properties on the apparent Michaelis constants for substrates. Michaelis constants of penicillin G acylase catalysts of different enzyme load and particle sizes varied between 0.73 and 4.55 mM and between 3.0 and 11.1 mM for the hydrolysis of penicillin G and the synthesis of cephalexin respectively. Michaelis constants for penicillin G acylase biocatalysts subjected to progressive size reduction were reduced from 5.0 to 0.46 mM and from 7.2 to 2.1 mM for hydrolysis of penicillin G and synthesis of cephalexin respectively. Higher fluctuation between these values in hydrolysis of penicillin G reflects higher impact of diffusional restrictions on this reaction. Thièle modulus for the substrate was much higher for penicillin G hydrolysis than for cephalexin synthesis in a wide range of substrates concentrations. Ratio between moduli for hydrolysis of penicillin G and synthesis of cephalexin was 15 at saturating concentration of phenylglycine methyl ester and increased at lower concentrations of such substrate. Results highlight the importance of designing the biocatalyst according to the reaction in which it will be used, being particularly important in the case of penicillin G acylase that is currently being used both in reactions of hydrolysis and synthesis.",

The microbial consortium showed efficient degradation activity on potential biorefinery cellulosic substrates, including bagasse, rice straw, corn stover and industrial eucalyptus pulp sludge.

Five fusion variants with linker containing different length and ratio of Ala/Gly were produced in Escherichia coli and purified for characterization of their enzymatic and kinetic properties. The fusion proteins with linkers had similar temperature and pH profiles to those without linkers, being well in accordance with their parents.

     "abstract": "The need for new and efficient biocatalysts for asymmetric synthesis is caused by the increasing demand for enantiopure chiral alcohols in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. One approach to find new enzymes for technical applications is the screening of biodiversity. The identification of a novel oxidoreductase in the freshwater cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942, which is capable of enantioselectively reducing sterically demanding and multi-halogenated ketones, led to a search for homologous enzymes in other cyanobacterial strains. Here, we present a comparative study of 3-ketoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein)-reductases from 16 cyanobacteria belonging to different taxonomic groups. The genes encoding the respective oxidoreductases were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified enzymes were used for the reduction of four exemplarily chosen prochiral ketones. In either case, the specific enzymatic activities differed by two to three orders of magnitude. For example, ethyl 4-chloroacetoacetate was reduced with 0.1–250 U mg−1 to the corresponding (S)-alcohol in moderate to excellent enantiomeric excesses (53.4% to >99.8%). The 3-ketoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase from the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain RCC 307 showed a higher activity with all of the four substrates under study compared to the originally described biocatalyst from Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942. The reaction rates were up to 323% higher with comparable or better enantioselectivity. The analysis of relationships between protein sequences and enzyme characteristics led to the discovery of amino acid residues influencing catalytic properties of cyanobacterial KRs and thus provide the basis for a subsequent rational protein design.",

This study suggests that enzymatic hydrolysate of sake lees may be an alternative substrate for the efficient production of succinic acid by A. succinogenes 130Z.",

The enzyme was immobilized onto chitosan-single-walled carbon nanotubes (CS-SWCNTs) modified Au electrode via electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions. The fabricated procedures of the biosensor were characterized with Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical techniques. Effects of some experimental variables such as pH, applied potential, and temperature on the response of the biosensor were investigated. The CS-SWCNTs nanocomposite matrix could provide a favorable microenvironment for AFO to realize the direct electron transfer on the underlying electrode. The enzymatic electrode exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic response to ST, long-term stability, and good reproducibility. The linear range of ST determination was from 10 to 1480 ng mL−1 with a detection limit of 3 ng mL−1 based on the signal-to-noise ratio of 3.

Hydrogen fermentation occurred under the longer SRT condition, and when SRT was set at shorter, lactate production increased, and butyrate and hydrogen production decreased. Simultaneously, microbial composition change from Clostridium spp. to Bacillus spp., especially Bacillus coagulans was observed using random cloning method. Clear relationship between B. coagulans ratio and lactate concentration was obtained, but random cloning method is time and cost consuming, and not preciously quantitative. Applicability of real-time PCR quantification to monitor change in B. coagulans in kitchen garbage fermentation was verified. Acid fermentation produces many kinds of organic acids such as lactate, butyrate and acetate, and hydrogen gas, and similar operational conditions are proposed for hydrogen and lactate fermentations. Real-time PCR quantification methods would be useful for developing a new monitoring tool for acid fermentation, especially with complex substrates, where many kinds of bacteria compete with each other in the same reactor.",

To date in order to determine the viability of entrapped bacteria, they have to be de-entrapped from the matrix first. However, the cell de-entrapment procedures such as matrix dissolution by acid or heating at high temperatures, may affect the viability of the cells. In this study, the uses of two quantitative approaches for in situ viability estimation of calcium alginate and phosphorylated poly(vinyl) alcohol (PPVA) entrapped Escherichia coli were investigated. Bioreducible tetrazolium salt (XTT) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) based assays were used to determine microbial viability without the dissolution of the matrices (spherical beads). The data from both assays showed linearity and strong correlations between the viability signals and number of beads in which each bead contained a similar number of live cells. An application of XTT assay on the PPVA entrapped bacterial beads was an exception to these results. Effects of the acid and heat dissolution de-entrapment procedures on cell viability were also evaluated by using both assays and a traditional plate count method. The heating process showed the greatest reduction in bacterial viability when compared to the other de-entrapment procedures. The ATP assay is a more sensitive and less time consuming approach for viability estimation when compared to the XTT assay and traditional plate count method. Both XTT and ATP assays have potential for use in quantifying the viability of entrapped bacteria.",

We therefore focused on determining the relationship between protein kinase C (PKC), ROS and LIP-H2. Significantly lower PKC activity was measured in high-LIP-producing (oxygenated) vs. low-LIP-producing (aerated—grown with free exchange of atmospheric air) cultures. In oxygenated cultures, inactivation of PKC activity by calphostin C, staurosporin or H7 caused significant elevation in lip-H2 and also in MnSOD1 expression. Stimulation of PKC by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) caused the reverse effect. Significantly low levels of lip-H2 expression were detected when O2−, H2O2 or OH were scavenged by 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene disulfonic acid (Tiron), pyruvate or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), whether the level of PKC was normal, stimulated or inactivated. In situ generation of OH, via addition of Fenton reagents to aerated cultures, reduced pkc expression. In contrast, OH scavenging stimulated pkc expression. This work suggests that due to high OH levels, fungal cells activate a complex defensive system which regulates the levels of Fenton components by repressing PKC and stimulating LIP, MnSOD1 and catalase.",

These selected sites were then substituted with other amino acids that were determined to be more rigid than the original amino acids by computational modeling using ‘RosettaDesign’. As a result of this rational approach, several thermostable CalB mutants including R249L were produced. The residual activity of R249L CalB was two times higher than that of wild type CalB at 55 °C. Melting temperature (Tm) of R249L mutant increased to 56.8 °C compared with wild type CalB (Tm: 54.5 °C), which was determined by DSF (differential scanning fluorimetry). Additionally, packing analysis tool “Voronoia” pointed out that one cavity close to residue 249 of wild type CalB disappeared in CalB R249L, which could be the reason for the increase in thermal stability of CalB R249L mutant compared wild type CalB.",

     "abstract": "Continuous production with in situ separation of fatty acid ester in ionic liquid (IL) was investigated through lipase-catalyzed transesterification of butyl alcohol and vinyl laurate in 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([Omim][TfO]) as a model reaction. Since the ester product is immiscible with IL, continuous separation of the product from reaction media can be easily achieved. The optimized reaction conditions for lipase-catalyzed transesterification in [Omim][TfO] were experimentally studied in batch operation. To combine continuous reaction operation with in situ separation exploiting immiscibility, a double-layer type continuous stirred tank reactor was developed. By using this reactor, the efficiency of in situ separation of product from IL and the operational stability were tested at various flow rates (0.375–0.75 mL/h) under optimized reaction conditions determined in batch operation (1.2:1 molar ratio of butyl alcohol to vinyl laurate and 10 mg of Novozym 435 in 0.5 mL [Omim][TfO]). Results proved that continuous ester production in an integrated production/separation process was successful without any loss of IL and was stable for at least 5 days after a steady-state was reached. Our investigations demonstrate that this continuous production integrated with in situ separation system provides a promising basis for the development of environment-friendly processes for practical production and separation of compounds in ILs.",

The organosolv process was assessed using biotreated material that showed a high viscosity loss and a mass loss ranging from 6% to 8%. The experiment was designed to optimize the organosolv conditions, ethanol:water ratio and H factor (factor that combines temperature and time in one variable) to obtain the highest ethanol yield by simultaneous enzymatic saccharification and fermentation (SSF) for 96 h at 10% consistency. The optimized conditions for organosolv process for biotreated material were: ethanol:water mixture (60/40, v/v) and 1156 H factor (185 °C, 18 min); the optimized conditions for the control (chips without biotreatment) were: ethanol:water mixture (60/40, v/v) and 6000 H factor (200 °C, 32 min). The experimental ethanol yields obtained at these conditions were 63.8% and 64.3% (wood basis) for biotreated material and control, respectively. The maximum amount of ethanol that could be produced from P. radiata is 252 g ethanol/kg wood, assuming total glucose conversion into ethanol. The results indicate that the obtained ethanol was 161 g ethanol/kg wood from both materials. The biotreatment of the wood before the organosolv process improved solvent accessibility. To obtain the same ethanol yield, lower process severity was required in the biotreated samples in comparison with the control.",

The sequence analysis of the isolated genes showed 32–80% amino acid sequence identities to known esterases/lipases in public databases. The isolated genes were subsequently expressed in recombinant Escherichia coli. Insoluble proteins were noted in the expression of the majority of the isolated genes. The findings suggest that it is difficult to isolate these genes by using activity-based screening with construction of metagenome library. For the enzymes characterized, we examined substrate specificity, optimal temperature, optimal pH, and thermal stability. The substrate specificity of all the enzymes was high for p-nitrophenyl acetate, but almost undetectable for p-nitrophenyl decanoate. The results indicate that the obtained enzymes are defined as esterases. The enzymes were active in a broad range of temperature. The optimum activity was observed at 25–70 °C and at pH 8.0–9.0. Some enzymes have moderate thermostability and would be useful for industrial enzymes. This study illustrates that pre-amplified inverse PCR, which is one of the sequence-based approach, is potentially applicable to the isolation of diverse genes from environmental DNA.",

HSD, and under the higher Mn2+ concentration, strain HSD can form very small micro-mycelium pellets (MMPs). Based on this phenomenon, a specific method to cultivate aerobic granules is presented. By seeding MMPs to bioreactor, bioaugmented aerobic granules (BAGs) were cultivated successfully, and granulation rate reached 53 ± 2% on day 15. MMPs result in the formation of aerobic granules containing MMPs as nuclei and also induce the formation of self-immobilized biogranules which do not have the MMP at their core. Furthermore, the feasibility of using BAGs to degrade eriochrome black T (EBT) wastewater is investigated too. The results prove that the treatment of EBT wastewater using BAGs is a feasible and promising way. BAGs not only can tolerate higher EBT loads, but also have better decolourization efficiency compared with conventional sludge and aerobic granules. Furthermore, the introduction of MMPs leads to the appearance of manganese peroxidase (MnP) in reactor, and MnP plays an important role in the treatment process of EBT wastewater.",

Cryogel beads showed macroporous internal architecture and nano-range grooves on outer periphery.

Advantages of RQ feedback control over the conventional ethanol feedback control in the GSH industry include lower byproduct concentration, shorter cultivation period, higher GSH content, and higher GSH yield. Hence, feedback control based on RQ is a promising method that poses as a simple and efficient alternative to conventional feed control techniques presently practiced in the GSH industry.",

MnP activity was found to increase by 58.16% in stationary batch cultures and an increased MnP productivity of 88.15% was observed after continuous operation with the SCMGR. The phospholipid rich production medium also stimulated intracellular organelles involved in respiration and protein synthesis, and increased biofilm development radially across the membrane support matrix.",

A conventional aqueous–organic solvent two-phase system is inaccessible to extractive fermentation of a relatively high polar bioproduct as the confliction between the biocompatibility and the extraction ability of the corresponding organic solvent. An exploitation of cloud point system as a novel medium engineering method for extractive microbial fermentation is reviewed in present work. The relationship between phase separation of nonionic surfactant aqueous solution forming cloud point system and its corresponding biocompatibility to microorganisms, and the relationship between solubilization and bioavailability of organic compounds in a cloud point system are discussed. Paradigms of extractive microbial fermentation in cloud point system are highlighted with some cases in our lab.

The untreated and chemically modified forms of both enzymes were then immobilised onto three different types of mesoporous silicate (MPS) particle (MCM, CNS and SBA-15). Thermal stabilities of native, modified-soluble and immobilised laccases were then evaluated. Although the two laccases have similar lysine contents, those of M. thermophila are clearly more amenable to chemical modification. Treatment of the M. thermophila enzyme with EGNHS led to a 8.7-fold increase in thermal stability over the free soluble enzyme while glutaraldehyde gave a 5.7-fold increase. Increased activity of M. thermophila laccase occurred only with citraconic anhydride modification (a 3-fold increase), while the glutaraldehyde modification marginally increased the activity of the T. hirsuta enzyme (by 1.2-fold). Upon immobilisation onto MPS, the greatest increase in stability was for the glutaraldehyde-treated M. thermophila preparation on SBA-15 (24-fold over the soluble enzyme). Chemical modification of laccase from T. hirsuta with both glutaraldehyde and EGNHS gave only a 2-fold increase in stability, increasing >4-fold upon immobilisation onto SBA-15 and MCM-41/98.",

The enzyme is a monomer of 15 kDa and 18 kDa by SDS-PAGE, and gel filtration, respectively. Asymmetric synthesis of (R)-mandelonitrile from benzaldehyde and acetone cyanohydrin in a biphasic system employing the PeHNL from rinds of P. edulis was carried out. Several parameters influenced the enantiomeric purity of the product and initial velocity of the reaction. Both pH and temperature were important parameters controlling the enantiomeric purity of the product. The optimum pH and temperature were pH 4 and 10 °C, respectively. At the optimum pH and temperature, the spontaneous non-enzymatic reaction yielding the racemic mandelonitrile was almost completely suppressed. The PeHNL was stable (more than 80% residual activity after incubation for 12 h) in the system of methyl-t-butyl ether (MTBE), dibutyl ether (DBE), hexane (HEX), and diisopropyl ether (DIPE) while diethyl ether (DEE) and ethyl acetate (EA) were not suitable solvents. The initial velocity was markedly affected by the type of organic solvent in the biphasic system, while high enantiomeric purity was obtained when organic solvents having log P lower than 3.5 were used. The highest initial velocity of reaction and enantiomeric purity of (R)-mandelonitrile were obtained in the biphasic system of DBE with the aqueous phase content of 30% (v/v). The optimum substrate concentrations were 250 mM for benzaldehyde and 900 mM for acetone cyanohydrin, and the optimum enzyme concentration was 26.7 units/ml. The highest enantiomeric purity of (R)-mandelonitrile was successfully obtained with conversion and enantiomeric excess of 31.6% and 98.6%, respectively.

F. graminearum is able to utilize triglycerides as a carbon source during growth. Extracellular lipases are the preferred enzymes to catalyze the hydrolysis of fats and oils. Lipases are ubiquitous enzymes of considerable physiological significance and industrial potential. Previously, FGL1 was the first described F. graminearum extracellular lipase associated with virulence. We report the biochemical characterization of FGL1 and four new secreted lipases of F. graminearum. The lipase genes of F. graminearum wild-type strain 8/1 were sequenced, cloned and over-expressed in Pichia pastoris. We show that the lipases have their temperature optimum between 30 and 40 °C and a pH optimum of ∼7. A broad range of lipase substrates, from C4 to C18 p-nitrophenyl esters, were hydrolyzed efficiently by the lipases, indicating the true lipolytic activity of the enzymes. Expression patterns of these lipases were also analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR in F. graminearum cultured in water supplemented with 2% (v/v) wheat germ oil at 28 °C. Transcripts of all examined lipases are detectable and the genes are regulated differently under these culture conditions. Our data indicated that F. graminearum possesses a ubiquitous source of secreted lipases, which could be used for industrial intentions.

Based on the antibiogram assay, strain GR5 possesses a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeast, algae, and strain GR5 itself. Strain GR5 can synthesize a macromolecule with antimicrobial activity due to the generation of hydrogen peroxide and this antimicrobial effect can be inhibited by catalase. This antimicrobial activity is active only in complex culture media or chemically defined culture media containing l-lysine. This antimicrobial macromolecule in strain GR5 is shown to be a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 71 kDa and isoelectric point of approximately 3.68.

Moreover, by applying the novel strategies of regenerating ATP by feeding glucose at 6 g/(l h) from 60 to 72 h coupled with impulse SDS treatments, a total glutathione yield of 2485 mg/l was achieved at 72 h, which was 8.7% higher than with addition of ATP and SDS, suggesting application of the proposed strategies as being feasible for glutathione overproduction on industrial scales.",

P. sanguineus biomass underwent a dramatic growth inhibition with 1 mM Cu2+ and marked delay in growth with 0.5 mM Cu2+. Proteins were increased with copper in Peniophora sp., C. versicolor and G. applanatum. G. applanatum and Peniophora sp. reached the highest enzyme activity at 10th day equivalent to 49.2-fold and 19.7-fold higher than the control samples, respectively.

It was shown that Amy A is able to transform maltose to higher molecular weight oligosaccharides like maltoheptaose, through a combination of transfer and hydrolysis reactions: the fact that the enzyme can use maltose to generate higher molecular weight products is an almost unique property among α-amylases, with neotrehalose as one of the products of the transglucosylation activity. Amy A is also capable of efficiently performing alcoholysis reactions from starch and maltodextrins to methanol and butanol, generating alkyl-glycosides. This is the first report in the scientific literature concerning the synthesis of neotrehalose by an α-amylase.",

     "abstract": "The kinetics of enzymatic acylation of a bifunctional molecule exhibiting both an amino and a hydroxyl function, considered as a peptide-like model molecule, is studied. The acylation of 6-amino-1-hexanol by ethyl oleate in 2-methyl-2-butanol catalysed by Novozym 435® has been investigated and modelled. This acylation process generated two products issued respectively from the O-acylation of the 6-amino-1-hexanol, and from the N-acylation of the O-acyl product, which leads to the N,O-diacyl product. Experimental results confirmed the sequential reaction scheme. An experimental approach was adopted to identify the impact of several operating conditions on the reaction performances, such as initial substrates molar ratio and stirring rate. The kinetics of enzyme deactivation was also studied and included in the kinetic model. The establishment of the kinetic model was based on three major hypotheses: (i) a sequential bi bi ping-pong enzymatic mechanism, (ii) an interaction between acyl-acceptor and the acyl-enzyme formation steps, (iii) the absence of influence of the residual hydrolysis of ethyl oleate on the kinetics. Under this hypothesis, the kinetic parameters of the model were quantified using a genetic-evolutionary algorithm as an innovative identification method. The simplified model made it possible to describe the kinetics of the 6-amino-1-hexanol acylation for some ranges of 6-amino-1-hexanol/ethyl oleate molar ratios (2/1, 1/1, 1/2, 1/4) with a single kinetic parameter set. The case of a significant excess of 6-amino-1-hexanol (4/1) or ethyl oleate (1/8) constituted the limit of the kinetic model. However, these extreme molar conditions are not suitable to develop bioconversion processes involving bioactive peptides that are not available in large quantities.",

The hIL-12 gene was cloned into the rice expression vector under the control of the Ramy3D promoter. Transgenic rice calli were prepared via particle bombardment-mediated transformation and were screened for rhIL-12p70 expression using ELISA. Western blot and bioassay results confirmed that rhIL-12p70 was expressed and secreted into the culture medium as a functionally active heterodimeric form, and the productivity of rhIL-12p70 was estimated as 12.7 mg/L, which is approximately 73-fold higher than was observed with the tobacco cell culture system [Kwon TH, Seo JE, Kim J, Lee JH, Jang YS, Yang MS.

Although xylitol is currently manufactured by the chemical reduction of xylose, its biological production would be attractive because of lower costs and better organoleptic features. In xylose-fermenting yeasts, the substrate is directly converted to xylitol by an NAD(P)H-dependent reductase (XR). Xylitol is oxidized in turn by an NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase (XDH) yielding xylulose, which is channelled into the pentose phosphate pathway. In the absence of other carbon sources, a significant fraction of xylitol is used to fuel cell growth. To avoid excess yield loss and maximize xylitol production, a series of mono- and disaccharides were tested as cosubstrates for a hyper-acidophilic strain of Candida tropicalis. Their effect upon XR and XDH specific activity levels was evaluated, and the resulting expression of the inducible pathway and the XR:XDH ratio were related to either non-optimized or optimized yields. Glucose strongly inhibited xylose reduction, whereas galactose stimulated xylitol utilization. On the contrary, the addition of low concentrations of maltose significantly increased biomass growth and xylitol accumulation.",

A laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila was used to catalyze coupling reactions of the aromatic amines produced from decolorizing the dyes. The reaction was carried out with stirring (100 rpm) in a weak acidic buffer solution (pH 5.0) at 45 °C for 3 days. The presence of aromatic amines in the samples after bacterial decolorizing confirmed the azo bond was reduced in the process. In addition, the UV–vis spectrum was shifted significantly after the sequential bacterial-laccase treatment also indicating a chemical transformation of the dyes. After laccase treatment the solutions formed colored soluble and precipitated products. The particles sizes making up the precipitates formed after laccase treatment varied between 105 and 483 nm as determined by Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS). The laccase treatment also reduced the COD of the dye solutions by ∼20%. We show that successive bacterial-laccase treatment is effective in decolorized azo dyes by reduction of the azo bonds, and promoting coupling reactions between the aromatic amines formed. Promoting coupling reactions between the aromatic amines using enzymes may prove useful for the physical removal and reuse of these amines.",

At the optimal YGA/CHI ratio of 0.625 g g−1, the specific activity (ABi) of the biocatalysts decreased from circa 300 to 70 IU g−1 wet support, as the bead average diameter (dP) increased from 0.14 to 2.2 mm. Generally, ABi reduced less than 5% after preservation in the wet form at 4 °C for 150–170 days. Only the biocatalyst prepared using the Chitopearl BCW-3001 lost about 40% of its initial activity.The kinetics of urea degradation in a model wine solution using these biocatalysts was of the pseudo-first order with respect to the urea concentration in the liquid bulk, the apparent pseudo-first order kinetic rate constant (kIi) ranging from about two thirds to one fifth of that (kIf) pertaining to free acid urease.

When the model wine solution was enriched with the high-inhibitory tannins extracted from grape seeds, at the maximum level tested (374 ± 2 g GAE m−3) kIi reduced to no more than (58 ± 9)% of kIf, this proving quite a higher protective action against such compounds for the chitosan-based biocatalysts towards free or Eupergit® C 250 L-immobilised acid urease.",

Laccase was able to catalyse the oxidation of all the pulps studied. The reactivity of the pulp was found to be affected by both the physical accessibility of lignin in the fibres and the chemistry of the surface lignin accessible to laccase. Laccase dosage, use of extra oxygen in the laccase catalysed radicalization reaction, treatment time and also the amount and type of low-molecular weight compounds (LMWC) present in the pulp were all found to contribute to the radical content of pulp fibres measured after the enzymatic reaction.

     "abstract": "Lignocellulose is widely recognized as a sustainable substrate for biofuels production, and the enzymatic hydrolysis is regarded as a critical step for the development of an effective process for the conversion of cellulose into ethanol. One key factor affecting the overall conversion rate is the adsorption capacity of the cellulase enzymes to the surface of the insoluble substrate. Pretreatment has a strong impact on hydrolysis, which could be related to both chemical changes and morphological changes of the material. In the current work, the accessibility of four differently pretreated wheat straw substrates, two differently pretreated spruce materials, and Avicel cellulose was investigated. Adsorption isotherms (at 4 °C and 30 °C) for a cellulase preparation were obtained, and the rates of hydrolysis were determined for the different materials. Furthermore, the surface area and pore size distribution of the various materials were measured and compared to adsorption and hydrolysis properties, and the structures of the pretreated materials were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).The results demonstrated a positive correlation between enzyme adsorption and the substrate specific surface area within each feedstock. Overall, the amount of enzyme adsorbed was higher for pretreated spruce than for the pretreated wheat straw, but this was not accompanied by a higher initial rate of hydrolysis for spruce. Also, the difference in the measured endoglucanase adsorption and overall FPU adsorption suggests that a larger fraction of the enzyme adsorbed on spruce was unproductive binding. The SEM analysis of the material illustrated the structural effects of pretreatment harshness on the materials, and suggested that increased porosity explains the higher rate of hydrolysis of more severely pretreated biomass.",

     "abstract": "Enzyme hydrolysis of pretreated cellulosic materials slows as the concentration of solid biomass material increases, even though the ratio of enzyme to cellulose is kept constant. This form of inhibition is distinct from substrate and product inhibition, and has been noted for lignocellulosic materials including wood, corn stover, switch grass, and corn wet cake at solids concentrations greater than 10 g/L. Identification of enzyme inhibitors and moderation of their effects is of considerable practical importance since favorable ethanol production economics require that at least 200 g/L of cellulosic substrates be used to enable monosaccharide concentrations of 100 g/L, which result in ethanol titers of 50 g/L. Below about 45 g/L ethanol, distillation becomes energy inefficient. This work confirms that the phenols: vanillin, syringaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, and hydroxybenzoic acid, inhibit cellulose hydrolysis in wet cake by endo- and exo-cellulases, and cellobiose hydrolysis by β-glucosidase. A ratio of 4 mg of vanillin to 1 mg protein (0.5 FPU) reduces the rate of cellulose hydrolysis by 50%. β-Glucosidases from Trichoderma reesei and Aspergillus niger are less susceptible to inhibition and require about 10× and 100× higher concentrations of phenols for the same levels of inhibition.

On the other hand, solubilization of hemicellulose, especially of xylan, is known to enhance the hydrolysis of cellulose. The enzymatic hydrolysis of spruce, recognized among the most challenging lignocellulosic substrates, was studied by commercial and purified enzymes from Trichoderma reesei. Previously, the enzymatic hydrolysis of steam pretreated spruce has been studied mainly by using commercial enzymes and no efforts have been taken to clarify the bottlenecks by using purified enzyme components.Steam-pretreated spruce was hydrolyzed with a mixture of Celluclast and Novozym 188 to obtain a hydrolysis residue, expectedly containing the most resistant components. The pretreated raw material and the hydrolysis residue were analyzed for the enrichment of structural bottlenecks during the hydrolysis. Lignin was removed from these two materials with chlorite delignification method in order to eliminate the limitations caused by lignin. Avicel was used for comparison as a known model substrate. Mixtures of purified enzymes were used to investigate the hydrolysis of the individual carbohydrates: cellulose, glucomannan and xylan in the substrates. The results reveal that factors limiting the hydrolysis are mainly due to the lignin, and to a minor extent by the lack of accessory enzymes. Removal of lignin doubled the hydrolysis degree of the raw material and the residue, and reached close to 100% of the theoretical within 2 days. The presence of xylan seems to limit the hydrolysability, especially of the delignified substrates. The hydrolysis results also revealed significant hemicellulose impurities in the commonly used cellulose model substrate, making it questionable to use Avicel as a model cellulose substrate for hydrolysis experiments.",

     "abstract": "Industrial application of α-galactosidase requires efficient methods to immobilize the enzyme, yielding a biocatalyst with high activity and stability compared to free enzyme. An α-galactosidase from tomato fruit was immobilized on galactose-containing polymeric beads. The immobilized enzyme exhibited an activity of 0.62 U/g of support and activity yield of 46%. The optimum pH and temperature for the activity of both free and immobilized enzymes were found as pH 4.0 and 37 °C, respectively. Immobilized α-galactosidase was more stable than free enzyme in the range of pH 4.0–6.0 and more than 85% of the initial activity was recovered. The decrease in reaction rate of the immobilized enzyme at temperatures above 37 °C was much slower than that of the free counterpart. The immobilized enzyme shows 53% activity at 60 °C while free enzyme decreases 33% at the same temperature. The immobilized enzyme retained 50% of its initial activity after 17 cycles of reuse at 37 °C. Under same storage conditions, the free enzyme lost about 71% of its initial activity over a period of 7 months, whereas the immobilized enzyme lost about only 47% of its initial activity over the same period. Operational stability of the immobilized enzyme was also studied and the operational half-life (t1/2 was determined as 6.72 h for p-nitrophenyl α-d-galactopyranoside (PNPG) as substrate. The kinetic parameters were determined by using PNPG as substrate. The Km and Vmax values were measured as 1.07 mM and 0.01 U/mg for free enzyme and 0.89 mM and 0.1 U/mg for immobilized enzyme, respectively. The synthesis of the galactose-containing polymeric beads and the enzyme immobilization procedure are very simple and also easy to carry out.",

Incubation of SOP, mixed (25%, w/w) with various conventional feedstuffs (i.e., wheat bran, wheat middlings, barley grains, crimson clover, wheat flour shorts and field beans), with Pleurotus ostreatus and Pleurotus pulmonarius led to significant CP increases, ranging from 7 to 29%, and marked removal (from ca. 50–90%) of phenols after 6 weeks. Both species, however, led to moderate delignification associated with significant consumption of hemicelluloses. Consequently, no improvements of both organic matter digestibility (OMD) and net energy of SOP–feedstuff mixtures occurred after the fungal colonization.",

     "abstract": "Activated sludge obtained from two municipal wastewater treatment facilities (WWTF) was used as seed sludge for enriched nitrifiers, which were later entrapped in polyvinyl alcohol. Seed sludge from one WWTF was acclimated to high ammonia level (1813 mg NH3-N l−1) through the return of sludge digester supernatant back to primary clarifier while seed sludge from the other WWTF was un-acclimated. To elucidate on how to control partial nitrification by entrapped cells, which could be different from suspended cells, kinetics of entrapped enriched nitrifiers were studied using a respirometric assay. The community of nitrifiers within the entrapment matrix, which was observed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique, was related to the nitritation and nitratation kinetics based on oxygen uptake rate. Maximum oxygen uptake rate, and substrate and oxygen affinities of both ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) for nitritation and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) for nitratation in entrapped cells were lower than those of corresponding suspended cells. Under dissolved oxygen (DO) limiting conditions, nitratation was more suppressed than nitritation for suspended cells, while for the entrapped cells, the results were the contrary. A free ammonia (FA) inhibition affected only the un-acclimated sludge. Either FA inhibition or DO limitation might not be a sole effective control parameter to achieve partial nitrification by entrapped cells. FISH results revealed that Nitrosomonas europaea was the dominant AOB while Nitrobacter species was the dominant NOB in all cases. Heterotrophs were also present in the entrapment at 22.8 ± 18.6% and 41.5 ± 4.3% of total bacteria for acclimated and un-acclimated originated sludge. The availability of substrate and oxygen governed the distributions of AOB, NOB and heterotrophs within the entrapment and nitritation kinetics of entrapped nitrifiers.",

Both tasidotin and metabolite M1 were found to be competitive inhibitors of highly purified prolyl oligopeptidase (POP; EC 3.4.21.26) from Flavobacterium meningosepticum as measured by chromogenic and fluorogenic assays. HPLC analysis showed that POP converted tasidotin to M1 but not further to M2. Formation of M1 was linear for 120 min with a Vmax of 9.26 ng/mL min and an apparent Km of 0.238 mM (153 μg/mL). Several other enzymes known to cleave peptides at proline residues did not convert tasidotin to either M1 or M2.

Detection of chitinase activity on SDS-PAGE after protein renaturation indicated that the molecular mass of the protein band expressing chitinase activity was approximately 72 kDa. This suggests that the dimeric form of ChiA is the enzymatically active form when glycol chitin is used as a substrate.

In vitro assays showed that the extent of linoleic acid peroxidation was positively correlated with the level of MnP recovered from the biotreated wood chips. Milled wood was treated in vitro by partially purified MnP and linoleic acid. UV spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) showed that soluble compounds similar to lignin were released from the milled wood. SEC data showed a broad elution profile compatible with low molar mass lignin fractions. MnP-treated milled wood was analyzed by thioacidolysis.

To confirm the function of the p02 gene, a recombinant expression plasmid was constructed by inserting the p02 gene into a pQE-31 plasmid; the recombinant construct was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli JM109. The lytic activity of the expressed, purified product was observed by gel diffusion assay. The result showed that the recombinant plasmid successfully expressed 6 × his-tagged p02 protein. The expressed product had a growth inhibitory effect on Staphylococcus aureus but not on Pseudomonas aeruginosa or E. coli. However, it retained lytic activity against peptidoglycan from cell walls of P. aeruginosa and E. coli. Therefore, it is supposed that this lysozyme requires the help of holin or other punching proteins to exert lytic effects on live gram-negative bacteria.

The pulp is a rich source of biologically functional dietary fibers, but the targeted valorisation of the fibers requires removal of the residual starch from the pulp. The objective of this study was to release the residual starch, making up 21–22% by weight of the dry matter, from the potato pulp in a rational way employing as few steps, as few enzyme activities, as low enzyme dosages, as low energy input (temperature and time), and as high pulp dry matter as possible. Starch removal to obtain dietary fibers is usually accomplished via a three step, sequential enzymatic treatment procedure using a heat stable α-amylase, protease, and amyloglucosidase. Statistically designed experiments were performed to investigate the influence of enzyme dose, amount of dry matter, incubation time and temperature on the amount of starch released from the potato pulp. The data demonstrated that all the starch could be released from potato pulp in one step when 8% (w/w) dry potato pulp was treated with 0.2% (v/w) (enzyme/substrate (E/S)) of a thermostable Bacillus licheniformis α-amylase (Termamyl® SC) at 70 °C for at least 65 min.

Furthermore, among the mutants of RSU (S27A, L89A and R101A), the S27A mutation caused 56-fold decrease in Vmax of the holoenzyme, whereas the L89A and R101A showed 4- and 12-fold decrease, respectively. The holoenzymes with S27A and L89A showed resistance to leucine. These results reveal characteristics of SU herbicide-resistant mutants of the CSU, and catalytically important residues of the RSU in MtbAHAS.",

The purified enzyme showed a single band on SDS-PAGE with an estimated molecular mass of about 100 kDa for monomeric enzyme. Optimal conditions for the activity of the purified pullulanase were calculated as pH 5.5 and Topt = 65 °C. A reasonable stability was also observed at 60–70 °C. The enzyme could hydrolyze pullulan, starch and malto-oligosaccharides and was unable to degrade α-cyclodextrin and panose.

Therefore, this study aimed to study the ability of extremely halophilic archaea to reduce histamine under high salt condition and to examine the enzyme activity potentially involved. Of 156 extremely halophilic archaea isolated from various salt-fermented fishery products, HDS3-1 from an anchovy fish sauce sample fermented for 3 months, exhibited the highest histamine degradation activity when cultured in halophilic medium containing 5 mM histamine (free-base), followed by HDS1-1, HPC1-2, and HIS40-3, respectively. HDS3-1 was classified as Natrinema gari based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities and did not exhibit decarboxylase activity toward all tested amino acids. Based on in vitro cytotoxicity assay, the treatment with whole cell extract of HDS3-1 to all cell lines tested resulted in dose-dependent inhibitions of the cell growth with the IC50 values higher than 250 μg ml−1. Histamine-degrading activity of HDS3-1 was located in the intracellular fraction and required 1-methoxy-5-methylphenazinium methylsulfate (PMS) as an electron carrier. The optimal pH, salt concentration, and temperature for histamine degradation were pH 6.5–8, 3.5–5 M NaCl, and 40–55 °C, respectively. The activity was fully retained at pH 6.5–9, in the presence of NaCl above 2.5 M, and at temperature lower than 50 °C. The results suggested that histamine-degrading activity of HDS3-1 was most likely associated with salt-tolerant and thermo-neutrophilic histamine dehydrogenase.",

The aim was to improve the accessibility of target groups of TGase present in wool fabrics to the enzyme, thanks to chemical etching or the removal of the epicuticle layer by physical etching, thus leading to increased formation of cross-links or incorporation of primary amine compounds.For the plasma treatment, we found that oxygen promotes the cleavage of disulphide bonds by oxidation of sulphur species: a reduction of oxygen content in the gas plasma induced a reduction in oxidation yield, as shown by FTIR measurements. Conversely, nitrogen promoted a chemical etching reaction. The most significant effects were observed at high treatment power (400 W), where both cleavage of polymer chains and removal of the epicuticle layer were promoted.Air plasma at high power was the most promising pretreatment to the enzymatic process. The modifications induced a good penetration of the enzyme into the fibre core and no significant changes in enzyme activity were observed in contact with the plasma-treated fabrics.In contrast, by increasing the energy of the electrons in E-beam treatments no significant superficial modifications were observed. In fact, they promoted the cleavage of high-energy bond, such as S–S linkage, by enhancing depolymerization reaction.",

We have shown before that it is due to Glu134 in HaNDK, which results in steric hindrance and charge repulsion between two dimeric units and prevents further assembly into the tetramer and that changing the Glu134 to neutral Ala results in formation of a stable tetramer. To our surprise, both wild-type NDK from moderately halophilc Chromohalobacter salexigens (CsNDK/GNE: GNE represents Gly134-Asn135-Glu136) and mutant CsNDK/ A NE, both of which have a neutral amino acid at residue 134, were found to form a dimer. These constructs contain Glu136, which may also cause steric barrier and charge repulsion. A double mutant, CsNDK/ A N T , having Thr at 136 resulted in stable tetrameric assembly, supporting the above notion. A mutant CsNDK/ G N T reverted, however, to a dimer again, indicating that the introduced Ala residue at 134th in the double mutant generated a hydrophobic cluster consisting of the Ala residues and thereby stabilized dimer–dimer association of CsNDK assembly, while Gly destabilized it due to the loss of this cluster. Based on these observations, it is evident that both residues 134 and 136 contribute to the subunit assembly of CsNDK.",

We investigated the oxidizability of three fatty acids with varying degrees of polyunsaturation (linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic acids) by measuring conjugated dienes formation when lipid peroxidation was initiated either by MnP in the presence of Mn(II) or by chelated Mn(III). An inverse relationship between the degree of fatty acid unsaturation and the rate of peroxidation was found in both cases, but we also noted some differences between the two types of reaction. With MnP/Mn(II), the reaction developed slowly and resulted in sustained lipid peroxidation as determined by the formation of late-stage fatty acid degradation products. By contrast, the reaction with chelated Mn(III) was very rapid and did not result in the formation of these late-stage products, which suggests that this system failed to propagate the sustained radical chain reaction that is characteristic of complete lipid peroxidation. All three polyunsaturated fatty acids supported the co-oxidation of a non-phenolic lignin model compound by MnP, again showing an inverse relationship between the degree of unsaturation and reactivity, but chelated Mn(III) by itself supported only very low levels of fatty acid-mediated lignin model oxidation. These parallels in fatty acid reactivity are consistent with a reaction scheme in which Mn(III) acts as the proximal oxidant that initiates lipid peroxidation by MnP, thus generating fatty acid-derived radicals which in turn oxidize lignin structures. However, the results also suggest that the initial peroxyl radicals formed may not be the ligninolytic oxidants in this system. Instead, other radical oxidants produced during late-stage reactions of lipid peroxidation may be required.",

     "abstract": "A limited selection of assay and screening methodologies for cellulolytic enzymes has been stated as a restriction in biomass research. In this report we test the potential of isothermal calorimetry for this purpose. The primary observable in this technique (the heat flow in Watts), scales with the rate of hydrolysis, and unlike other approaches, it provides a continuous picture of the hydrolytic rate. It was found that the activity of a standard enzyme cocktail against purified cellulose substrates and dilute acid pretreated corn stover (PCS) was readily detected in calorimeters of different types, and that the calorimetric signal scaled with the enzyme activity measured by established analytical techniques. Hence, it was concluded that the heat flow provided a valid measure of the hydrolytic rate also in a complex biomass. The hydrolysis process was consistently found to be exothermic, but the amount of heat released per mole of soluble sugar produced varied for different types of substrates. This variation probably reflects heat contributions from processes which are coupled to the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond (e.g. dissolution of crystalline substrate or physical transitions in the solid matrix). Calorimetric determinations of absolute reaction rates therefore require initial calibration against another method for each new substrate. However, the main potential of the method lies in real-time measurements of relative changes in hydrolysis rates. This approach may be used both for different starting conditions and the titration of enzyme, substrate, promoters or inhibitors to reacting samples in different stages of the hydrolysis. These experiments are technically straight forward, do not require separate calibrations against other techniques and appear to be useful for studies of the regulation and functional mechanism of cellulases.",

     "abstract": "Laccase is a multi-copper oxidase that can decolorize textile dyes. There is increasing interest in its use to treat textile wastewaters which also contain auxiliary chemicals such as surfactants and salts. This investigation examines the effect of Merpol, a non-ionic surfactant, on the decolorization of Reactive blue 19, an anthraquinone dye, and on the oxidation of 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) by Trametes versicolor laccase. The results show that the surfactant had little effect on the enzyme or on ABTS oxidation which followed Michaelis–Menten kinetics. However, Reactive blue 19 decolorization was inhibited with increasing Merpol concentration. Spectroscopic analysis of the dye with Merpol and analysis of the kinetic data show that decolorization rates depended on an interaction between the dye and the surfactant. The proposed inhibition by a substrate depletion model in which the dye concentration decreases as a dye molecule binds to a surfactant molecule and/or is sequestered into micelles fits the data suitably and the model was validated by estimating the inhibition constant from independent saturation equilibrium binding assays. This study is the first to investigate the kinetic effect of a surfactant on the enzymatic dye decolorization and to show the depleting effect of Merpol on Reactive blue 19.",

     "abstract": "We have produced and characterized three microbial tetrahedral (TET) aminopeptidases: the previously uncharacterized Bacillus subtilis aminopeptidase (BsuAP), a Pyrococcus furiosus aminopeptidase (PfuAP), and a protein-engineered PfuAP-derived ‘designer’ aminopeptidase (MutAP) in which the entire active site of PfuAP is replaced with that of BsuAP through the making of 9 non-contiguous structure-guided mutations. The temperature/pH values of optimal function of MutAP (60 °C/pH 7.0) were found to be comparable to those of its progenitors, BsuAP (70 °C/pH 7.5) and PfuAP (80 °C/pH 8.0). The Km of MutAP (3.8 mM) was similar to that of PfuAP (5.0 mM) and unlike that of BsuAP (20.8 mM); however, unlike PfuAP, MutAP showed severe substrate-based inhibition like BsuAP, at substrate exceeding 5 mM concentration. MutAP thus inherits certain characteristics from each of its progenitors. At the same time, the Kcat of MutAP was ∼185-fold lower than that of PfuAP and ∼300-fold lower than that of BsuAP, indicating an unanticipated slowing down of activity. The results provide tentative evidence that ‘structure-guided transplantation’ of active sites between proteins can help in recombining enzyme characteristics in interesting and unanticipated ways, to help create novel enzymes.",

Studies were carried out to assess fermentation ensilaging as a method for recovery of oil from fresh water fish viscera. The total lipid content in the viscera ranged from 19% to 21% and upto 85% of this could be recovered by fermentation. Fermentation using added lactic cultures (Enterococcus faecium HAB01 and Pediococcus acidilactici K7) did not show any advantage over natural fermentation with respect to recovery of oil and no differences were observed in fatty acid composition of oil recovered by fermentation using different cultures. Activity of acidic, neutral and alkaline proteases decreased during fermentation. Eventhough degree of protein hydrolysis increased during fermentation with highest (62.3%) being in fermentation using Pediococcus acidilactici K7 no differences were found in oil recovery. With decrease in protease activity the rate of change in degree of hydrolysis also decreased.",

Elicitors were added individually at various concentrations to 5-day-old cell cultures and their effects monitored at 24 h intervals for 4 days. Different effects on OA accumulation were observed depending on the day of treatment. Jasmonic acid was the most efficient elicitor. After 72 h of treatment with 100 μM JA, the intracellular content of OA reached its maximum value (0.84 mg g−1 DW), which was 9.4-fold greater than that recorded in an untreated control cultures. The addition of chitosan at 50 mg l−1 produced a 5-fold enhancement of OA accumulation (0.37 mg g−1 DW) after 48 h of treatment. Treatment with yeast extract at 200 mg l−1 for 96 h or with pectin at 2 mg l−1 for 48 h produced identical cellular levels of OA (0.22 mg g−1 DW). Lastly, 48 h elicitation with homogenate of the fungus Trichoderma viride produced a 1.8-fold increase in oleanolic acid content (0.12 mg g−1 DW). In addition to significantly stimulating OA accumulation and its secretion into the culture medium, the elicitors also caused slight inhibition of cell growth.",

     "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the effect of two endophytic bacterial elicitors (Pseudomonas sp. and Enterobacter sp.) on the production of alkaloids in protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) of Pinellia ternata Breit. Both bacterial strains increased the growth rate of P. ternata PLBs. Pseudomonas sp. promoted the differentiation of the PLBs, whereas Enterobacter sp. inhibited PLB differentiation. The bacterial strains increased guanosine production in PLBs by 9–166%, inosine production by 2–33%, and trigonelline production by 114–1140% compared to the control. For Pseudomonas sp., guanosine and trigonelline production was greater when bacterial extracts were added to the PLB suspension cultures rather than living cells (co-culture treatment). Inosine production was similar in both the bacterial extract and co-culture treatments. For the Enterobacter sp., guanosine, inosine, and trigonelline production tended to be greatest when living cells were added to the PLB suspension cultures rather than bacterial extracts. These results suggest that Pseudomonas sp. and Enterobacter sp. could increase alkaloid yield from P. ternata under field or tissue culture conditions. We also observed that Pseudomonas sp. and Enterobacter sp. produced some of the same alkaloids as their host plants. Additional study needs to be done to determine if these endophytic bacteria could be used to produce alkaloids in the fermentation industry.",

MnP, LiP and laccase were detected when these fungi were cultured in malt extract, however when grown on basal medium containing glucose and wheat bran LiP was not detected and yet an increase in MnP and laccase was observed. Statistical analysis through surface responses was performed and results showed high values of MnP and laccase activities under 12.5% and 23% (w/v) salinity, highlighting the potential use of these fungi for industrial applications and in bioremediation of contaminated sites having high salt concentrations. The highest values for LiP (75376.34 UI L−1), MnP (4484.30 IU L−1) and laccase (898.15 UI L−1) were obtained with the fungus M. racemosus CBMAI 847 and it is the first report concerning ligninolytic enzymes production by a zygomycete from this genus.",

     "abstract": "The fungus Rhizopus is frequently used for fermentative production of lactic acid, but little is known about the mechanisms or proteins for transporting this carboxylic acid. Since transport of the lactate anion across the plasma membrane is critical to prevent acidification of the cytoplasm, we evaluated the functionality of two lactate-proton symport paralogs, LacA and LacB, from Rhizopus delemar. Both of these proteins showed significant ancestral homology to bacterial lactate permease with 46–50% identity to similar homologs from the genus Burkholderia. Based on qPCR, the highest level of expression in Rhizopus for the lacA gene was on complex medium containing pyruvate, while lacB transcript was barely detected with all of the tested culture conditions. A Saccharomyces cerevisiae jen1 deletion strain lacking the ability to transport monocarboxylates was restored for growth on lactate and pyruvate with the expression of LacA. Expression of the LacB in this same strain did not confer the ability to grow on either carbon source. LacA expression also allowed active transport of L-[14C(U)]-lactate into yeast cells and this accumulation was inhibited by the proton uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone. Translation fusions with GFP showed that LacA accumulates primarily in the plasma and vacuolar membrane, while LacB is dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. These results indicate that the Rhizopus LacA is a functional lactate symport that is probably involved in uptake of pyruvate or lactate, while the physiological role of LacB is unknown.",

     "abstract": "The methanolysis of soybean oil to produce a fatty acid methyl ester (ME, i.e., biodiesel fuel) was catalyzed by lipase-producing filamentous fungi immobilized on biomass support particles (BSPs) as a whole-cell biocatalyst in the presence of ionic liquids. We used four types of whole-cell biocatalysts: wild-type Rhizopus oryzae producing triacylglycerol lipase (w-ROL), recombinant Aspergillus oryzae expressing Fusarium heterosporum lipase (r-FHL), Candida antarctica lipase B (r-CALB), and mono- and diacylglycerol lipase from A. oryzae (r-mdlB). w-ROL gave the high yield of fatty acid methyl ester (ME) in ionic liquid [Emim][BF4] or [Bmim][BF4] biphasic systems following a 24 h reaction. While lipases are known to be severely deactivated by an excess amount of methanol (e.g. 1.5 Mequiv. of methanol against oil) in a conventional system, methanolysis successfully proceeded even with a methanol/oil ratio of 4 in the ionic liquid biphasic system, where the ionic liquids would work as a reservoir of methanol to suppress the enzyme deactivation. When only w-ROL was used as a biocatalyst for methanolysis, unreacted mono-glyceride remained due to the 1,3-positional specificity of R. oryzae lipase. High ME conversion was attained by the combined use of two types of whole-cell biocatalysts, w-ROL and r-mdlB. In a stability test, the activity of w-ROL was reduced to one-third of its original value after incubation in [Bmim][BF4] for 72 h. The stability of w-ROL in [Bmim][BF4] was greatly enhanced by cross-linking the biocatalyst with glutaraldehyde. The present study demonstrated that ionic liquids are promising candidates for use as the second solvent in biodiesel fuel production by whole-cell biocatalysts.",
