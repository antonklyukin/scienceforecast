     "abstract": "Antibiotics represent a major environmental health concern worldwide. In this study, a high concentration of erythromycin (ERY) was degraded by using single-chamber MECs with carbon cloth anodes. The electrochemical characteristics of MECs and the correlation with ERY were analysed. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that the removal of ERY reached 99% when the influent concentration of ERY was 20 mg/L. In addition, ermG was the most common antibiotic resistance gene, whether in the reactor effluent (3.37×105 copies/μL DNA) or in the anode biofilm (0.21×105 copies/μL DNA), while ermA was not detected. The SEM images indicated that the anodic and cathodic biofilm were mature and well-constructed. High throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA gene amplicons indicated that Geobacter, as a known genus of exoelectrogenic bacteria, is very dominant in the reactor anode biofilm, with a relative abundance of 77.0%. Acetoanaerobium was widely present in the biocathode. These results indicate that MECs can be considered to be a useful and reliable technology for improving ERY biodegradation efficiency in wastewater, thus providing a meaningful economic output and efficient operation in future scale-ups.",

     "abstract": "It has been widely demonstrated that perfusion bioreactors improve in vitro cell culture on three-dimensional (3D) matrices.We aimed to determine the local cell distribution, based on the pore diameter, within a 3D scaffold during cell growth in a perfusion bioreactor.Scaffolds under perfusion were collected at 0, 4, and 7 days of culture; scaffold morphology and cell distribution within the construct were evaluated by imaging analysis. A mathematical model representing the cell growth heterogeneity in 3D perfusion bioreactor was developed; a specific rate equation for glucose was experimentally determined. Model accuracy was assessed comparing the cell proliferation predictions with experimental data.Cell proliferation was successfully determined by coupling cell imaging with an ad hoc algorithm. The total number of cells in the scaffold, the number of cells for a single cross section, and the local cell distribution based on the scaffold pore size, were determined. Good agreement between computations and experiments was observed.A new methodology was developed to determine the cell heterogeneity within a 3D scaffold under perfusion. The proposed approach provides a helpful tool for 3D dynamic cell culture optimization for biological studies and tissue engineering applications.",

     "publication date": "06-2019",
     "abstract": "Ligand immobilization is indeed key fundamental for the development of high-capacity protein A chromatographic material. In this work, mono- and tetra-mers of Z domain from protein A were immobilized onto magnetic nanoparticle (NP) coated with carboxymethyl dextran (CMD), Fe3O4@CMD NP, via oriented coupling. Spectral results of Fe3O4@CMD-oZ NP with oriented Z domain showed that the molecular structure of the ligand was dominated by ligand – surface interaction. At pH 4.5, the ligand was disrupted by electrostatic attraction between NP surface and ligand. As buffer pH was higher than pI of the ligand, the ligand tended to be native structure with an increase of electrostatic repulsion between NP surface and ligands. At pH 10.0, therefore, the ligand remained intact on Fe3O4@CMD-oZ NP. Furthermore, ligand polymerization promoted the structural stability of the tetrameric ligand by decreasing interaction between NP surface and three domains at amino terminus of the ligand. It was more significant at pH 7.0 and the highest stoichiometric number of human IgG binding was obtained. Moreover, oriented immobilization was more beneficial for structural stability of the tetrameric ligand than random immobilization. Likely, spectral and calorimetric evidences at different ligand densities further demonstrated that the crowding effect induced at high ligand density maintained molecular structure of the tetrameric ligand better.",

     "publication date": "06-2019",
     "abstract": "In Penicillium chrysogenum, it has been observed that turnover of storage carbohydrates (trehalose, mannitol, arabitol, erythritol and glycogen) resulting in an extra ATP expenditure might partly account for the reduced penicillin productivity under dynamic cultivation conditions. In this work, Penicillium chrysogenum mutants with altered trehalose metabolism were constructed using the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method. It was observed that impaired trehalose biosynthesis did not result in growth arrest and change of glucose sensitivity to high glucose levels, but negatively influenced the sporulation. Compared with the original strain, in glucose-limited chemostat cultures, the biomass yield on glucose and energy efficiency were slightly enhanced; however, the penicillin productivity was significantly lowered in the trehalose mutant strains. Comparison with a high-yielding P. chrysogenum strain revealed that the original and mutant strains had a lower glucose uptake capacity but higher intracellular levels of free amino acids. Flux estimates through the central carbon metabolism showed distinctive difference in the upper part of the glycolysis and in the pentose phosphate pathway but comparable flux through the TCA cycle. Combining, the striking phenotypic effects observed in the trehalose mutants of P. chrysogenum indicated that trehalose metabolism plays an important role in metabolic regulation and is central to maintaining higher penicillin productivity under glucose-limited chemostat cultures.",

To the best of our knowledge, the highest amount of VFA accumulation reached to 53.87 g/L at pH 6 was reported. A kinetic model describing the hydrolysis and acidification process was developed to access the key kinetic parameters. A bipolar effect of pH on hydrolysis rate was first revealed by developed model, monotonical decline on acidification rate with increase of pH was also found. However, the decay rate of both bacteria group showed a bipolar form, resulting in kinetic favorable conditions for VFA accumulation at pH 5. Sequencing of V4-V5 region of 16S rRNA at Illumina Miseq plateform revealed an overwhelming predominance of Lactobacillus and Enterococcus in acidic and alkaline digester, respectively. Correspondence analysis indicated Lactobacillus, Paralactobacillus, and Clostridium contributed to VFA accumulation while Clostridium, Weissella, and Sporananaerobacter played an important role in H2 production.",

     "abstract": "The meso-molding three-dimensionally ordered macroporous alumina (3DOM/m-Al) was synthesized via a dual-templating approach (polystyrene (PS) colloidal crystals as hard template and triblock copolymer P123 as soft template) with hydrous aluminum isopropoxide as precursor. The obtained 3DOM/m-Al was characterized, and the results showed that 3DOM/m-Al had ordered macropores (ca. 300 nm in diameter) with wormhole-like mesopores, relatively high surface areas (338.1 m2/g), large pore volumes (0.4030 cm3/g) and tunable pore sizes. The amino functionalized 3DOM/m-Al by aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) was activated by glutaraldehyde and used as support for the immobilization of three different commercial enzymes (Lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB), penicillin G acylase (PGA) and nitrile hydratase (NHase)). The result of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) indicated that the enzyme was successfully immobilized onto glutaraldehyde-activated NH2-3DOM/m-Al. The effect of the immobilized conditions on the specific activity of enzymes was investigated. Compared with free enzymes, the immobilized enzymes exhibited enhanced thermal stability. The three immobilized enzymes (CALB@NH2-3DOM/m-Al, PGA@NH2-3DOM/m-Al and NHase@NH2-3DOM/m-Al) were applied for the synthesis of palmitic acid, 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) and acrylamide, respectively. After recycling 10 times, CALB@NH2-3DOM/m-Al, PGA@NH2-3DOM/m-Al and NHase@NH2-3DOM/m-Al retained approximately 76%, 87% and 52% of their initial activities, respectively, indicating that the immobilized enzymes had good operational stability.

Biofilms developed on soft, integrated and suspended biocarriers in three full-scale aerobic bioreactors under stable operations from municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants, were tracked for more than 11 weeks for biofilm aging study. Results showed the first evidence of biofilm aging in full-scale aerobic bioreactors by adenylate energy charge (AEC) that biofilm needed to be reactivated when AEC was less than 0.6. Biofilm aged more easily on soft and integrated biocarriers and high salinity, high organic contents and high suspended sludge concentration accelerated the aging process of biofilm. Caldilinea and Acinetobacter predominated in aging biofilm on suspended biocarriers. This study offered a novel evaluation methodology of biofilm aging and was believed to provide important reference for biofilm regulation in biofilm-based wastewater treatment process.",

     "abstract": "The relative effects of granular activated carbon (GAC) addition (25 g/L) in anaerobic digestion of food waste at mesophilic (37 °C) and thermophilic (55 °C) temperatures were investigated using biochemical methane potential (BMP) test. The addition of GAC significantly reduced lag phases for methane production in comparison with the unamended control at both temperatures. Microbial community analyses revealed that GAC addition increased the diversity and richness of both bacterial and archaeal communities. Besides, several known or potential electroactive fermentative bacteria (e.g., Calorameter, Sporanaerobacter, Coprothermobacter, etc.) were found in GAC-amended bioreactors at both temperatures, suggesting the possibility of DIET-based syntrophy in these reactors. At mesophilic temperature, GAC amendment increased methane productivity (L CH4/kg-VS) by almost two-fold in comparison with the control; however, methane production at the thermophilic temperature was unaffected by GAC addition. These results indicate that enhanced process kinetics at thermophilic temperature might diminish the visible impact on methane productivity due to the addition of GAC.",

     "abstract": "This article presents a nonlinear steady-state analysis of a continuous stirred tank bioreactor. The process of bioethanol production under aerobic conditions was analyzed. The kinetics of the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae microorganisms was described by the cybernetic model. This model includes metabolic reactions taking place in the biomass cells, which are a response to changes in the extracellular process environment. The dilution rate and the glucose concentration in the feed stream were used as bifurcation parameters. In both cases the performed analysis revealed the existence of multiple steady states areas and Hopf bifurcation points. The continuation of steady states, relative to the concentration of glucose in the feed stream, showed the presence of a rarely detected steady state branch, which was an isola. The numerical investigation was summerized in the form of a map which contains areas with biochemical reactions favoured by biomass cells. The map is made in a coordinate system of bifurcation parameters and illustrates perfectly the complexity of the model. In the opinion of the authors, it can be a very useful tool in planning the implementation of the process. It enables its proper targeting in the direction of activation of a specific metabolic reaction in the cells of microorganisms.",

Four extraction alternatives were assayed. The alternatives that uses high pressure and heat to pretreat the biomass showed equally lower production costs (US$ 4.28 per kg) and better economic indicators among evaluated scenarios. It was observed that method’s extraction capacity is not decisive in selecting the best alternative, but there must be the simultaneous analysis of extractability capacity and expenditures in equipment and utilities. Through five times increase in production capacity, the production cost significantly decreased, reaching US$ 2.71 per kg. Furthermore, achieving high cellular concentration can be responsible for a reduction of up to 18% in the production cost.",

     "abstract": "The coupled employment of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering strategies is prolific for the optimized production of value-added compounds. Terminators are the prime components in the “expression cassettes” that influence the net protein production. Herein, β-amyrin is overproduced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae through optimizing the pathway expression by the employment of SST (Short Synthetic Terminators). Initially, the βAS gene was expressed with PTEF1 promoter along-with TCYC1 terminator and produced 2.7 mg L−1 β-amyrin. The precursor's supply was enhanced through overexpressing the key regulatory genes of terpenoid pathway i.e. ERG1, ERG9, ERG20, IDI, tHMG1 controlled by constitutive promoters PERG1, PTPI1, PTDH3, PFBA1, PPGK1 that enhanced 3.8-fold β-amyrin production compared with the control strain. Moreover, a set of 23 SST was designed by analyzing the native terminator sequences and characterized, where, SynTER10, SynTER9, SynTER8, SynTER6, SynTER22, and SynTER19, terminators showed 5.57-, 5.04-, 3.55-, 3.40-, 1.89-, and 1.71-fold, enhanced expression of EGFP compared with native TCYC1 terminator. Subsequently, aforesaid strong SST was employed to optimize the expression of the β-amyrin pathway, which increased 3.16-fold production of β-amyrin. However, after optimization of the β-amyrin pathway, the engineered strain enhanced 12.14-fold (32.8 mg L−1) of β-amyrin production. Finally, using the 5 L fermenter, the production of β-amyrin was 108.26 mgL−1 which were 40-fold higher and that of ergosterol was 38.8 mgL−1, 6.80-fold higher comparative to the GSK1 strain.",

Crude extract of glutamic acid after isoelectric crystallization (CEGA) could be used instead of glutamate for γ-PGA production. The optimal composition of medium was obtained by response surface methodology. Firstly, Plackett-Burman design was undertaken to assess the effects of eight factors. With statistic regression analysis, the significant factors affecting γ-PGA production were determined as follows: chicken manure, soybean cake and CEGA. Then the Box-Behnken design was adopted for further optimization. The optimal addition amounts of factors were determined as: 62.35 g chicken manure, 25.15 g soybean cake and 15.09 g CEGA. Under such condition, the γ-PGA yield was increased to 6.57 ± 0.13%, which was 20.6% higher than the maximum value of the single factor tests. These investigations would lay a foundation for reducing the pollution of industrial wastes, exploring a late-model for agricultural γ-PGA production.",

     "publication date": "06-2019",
     "abstract": "We recently reported that Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) bonded on zwitterionic polymer-grafted silica nanoparticles (SNPs-pOD-CRL) showed remarkably enhanced catalytic activity and substrate affinity. The polymer, pOD, with long cetane side chains, was a polymer derivative of poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) and N,N-dimethylethylenediamine. Here, a new zwitterionic polymer with shorter alkyl side chains was synthesized by reaction between poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) and N,N-dimethylethylenediamine, denoted as pID, and grafted onto SNPs to develop a new zwitterionic support, SNPs-pID. CRL was coupled onto SNPs-pID, and SNPs-pID-CRL was extensively characterized and compared with SNPs-pOD-CRL. It was found that SNPs-pID-CRL presented higher enzyme-substrate affinity and catalytic activity than free lipase because of lipase activation by the hydrophobic alkyl chains of the polymer. Comparison with SNPs-pOD-CRL demonstrated that decreased hydrophobicity of the side chains was unfavorable for lipase activation, resulting in lower activity of lipase coupled on pID than on pOD. However, SNPs-pID-CRL exhibited significant increased thermal stability than SNPs-pOD-CRL because higher hydrophilicity of pID favored protein stabilization. These results indicate that a zwitterionic polymer with long alkyl side chains favor lipase activation rather than enzyme stability, while that with short alkyl side chains are beneficial to thermostability. Together, pID-functionalized support is promising for immobilized lipase of long-term applications. The work has thus provided new insights into the fabrication of thermostable immobilized lipase.",

In a microbial electrosynthesis (MES) system with neutral red as electron carrier and fumarate as the sole electron acceptor, the engineered strains derived from three E. coli lines displayed increased electric current in the reaction system, indicating improved electroactivity. Furthermore, the production of succinate from fumarate increased by around 60% compared with that of the parent strains, confirming the improvement of E. coli electroactivity by manipulating the FAD synthesis pathway. An MES reaction was performed with engineered E. coli 8739, and an altered metabolic profile with more reductive fermentation products was obtained. When the electroactive succinate-producing strain E. coli T110 was used in the MES, a yield of 0.97 ± 0.02 mol/mol glucose was achieved, which corresponds to an approximately 1.4-fold increase compared with the fermentation with no electricity supply or non-electroactive T110. In addition, a carbon concentration mechanism (CCM) was employed to further improve succinate production and yield in the MES, which produced a succinate yield of 1.16 mol/mol glucose, a 1.7-fold increase compared with that of the parent strain T110, indicating that the electroactive E. coli could be used in MES to produce specific fermentation products with improved yield.",

In order to address this problem, we performed saturation mutagenesis at all 11 methionine residues as their interaction with reactive oxygen species inactivates enzymes. For successful screening of these libraries a method based on yeast surface display (YSD) systems was developed. Mutations at methionine positions close to the GOx active site contributed the most to the oxidative stability, and combinations of the four best single mutations were tested. Combined mutants did not show higher stability or activity compared to the parental single mutants. To confirm oxidative stability of YSD expressed GOx mutants they were re-cloned in Pichia pastoris, purified and immobilized on macroporous copolymer. The additional kinetic analysis of immobilized GOx mutants confirmed that the best mutant with only one mutation close to the active site (M561S) has 2.5 times increased half-life in the presence of hydrogen peroxide compared to the wild-type variant.",

Catalyst reusability was also tested during five cycles and the bio-sorbent matrix (dead fungus) showed good stability after five reuse cycles. Photocatalytic decolorization of BR18 dye was much faster than RR180 dye, which we attributed to the electrostatic charge interaction between catalyst surface and dye molecules.",

Both acl overexpression strains significantly increased ACL activity, leading to elevate levels of acetyl-CoA. These strains completely degraded starch from rice powder after 4 days. Total Monascus pigments production was remarkably enhanced by 92.70% in M. ruber ACL438469-4 and 112.58% in M. ruber ACL501969-11 after 6 days. The red pigments in M. ruber ACL438469-4 and in M. ruber ACL501969-11 were more than that in parent strain. Transcriptome sequencing analysis of the acl overexpression strains vs the wild-type showed that differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in starch and glycolysis metabolism; valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation; glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; and Monascus pigment biosynthetic pathway. This implied metabolic flux for acetyl-CoA during pigment synthesis and NH3 for amination of red pigments.

     "abstract": "A proof-of-concept project compared extraction of arabinoxylans (AX) from sugarcane bagasse and wheat bran via alkaline hydrogen peroxide followed by enzyme-assisted extraction with combinations of feruloyl esterases and a xylanase. Bagasse contains comparable amounts of AX to wheat bran, but with a much lower arabinoxylan substitution on the xylan backbone (A:X ratio of around 0.2 compared with 0.6 for wheat bran), hence offering AX products with distinctive functionality and potential end uses. In the current work, bagasse released its AX more readily than wheat bran, and released a wider range of molecular weights. Use of feruloyl esterase and xylanase enzymes on their own or following alkaline peroxide extraction did not enhance AX release substantially; however, the xylanase appeared to be effective at reducing the size of AX molecules, and there is scope to optimise the effects of enzymes to produce specific AX product fractions. As bagasse frequently arises within the context of bioethanol production, integration of AX extraction with ethanol production could allow economic production of a portfolio of AX products, as has been demonstrated in principle for AX co-production in a wheat ethanol plant.",

The influence of the replenishment of powdered activated carbon (PAC) on sludge filterability and microbial community in hybrid MBRs was investigated. Results showed that the removal of organic matter and nitrogen were not significantly affected by the PAC refreshment, while soluble microbial products (SMP) concentration decreased and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) increased with increasing PAC replacement ratio. MBR system with PAC replenishment exhibited low fouling propensity and prolonged ﬁltration agreed well with fouling rate and resistance analysis. Molecular weight distribution of SMP in MBR confirmed the synergistic effects of PAC adsorption/biodegradation and membrane interception on organics removal. Microbial activity was positive associated with the PAC replenishment ratio. Moreover, the high-throughput sequencing indicated that due to fresh PAC added, the increased abundance of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Nitrospira guaranteed the pollutant removal, and the membrane fouling caused by Planctomycetes and Betaproteobacteria decreased. An optimal PAC replenishment ratio at 1.67% achieved the effective membrane fouling mitigation and enhanced dominant bacterial structure.

The mechanisms of the exceptional short-chain fatty acids promotion were mainly attributed to the simultaneous increase of bioavailable substrates and the fermentative community. The general microbial activity, key enzymes responsible for short-chain fatty acids generation, and diversity and abundance of fermentative bacteria were all enhanced under optimum conditions, which resulted in the rapid hydrolysis and acidification of bioavailable substrates for short-chain fatty acids generation.

     "abstract": "Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of nitrate on indole degradation characteristics and methanogenesis under mixed denitrification and methanogenesis culture for the first time. The degradation characteristics were studied under various nitrate concentrations. Nitrate was found to facilitate indole degradation and inhibit methane formation, and the optimum concentration was 50 mg L−1 (COD/NO3−-N = 12). Balance analyses showed that nitrate mainly affected indole-C, which generated a higher degree of indole mineralization under NO3−-N treatment than in the control. Furthermore, GC–MS combined with 13C-isotope analyses conclusively identified the intermediate metabolites, which included the hydroxylated compounds oxindole and isatin, and the methylated compound 3-methylindole. The results indicated that oxindole did not accumulate and was quickly reduced when nitrate was added, but 3-methylinole, as a recalcitrant material, accumulated without reduction. High-throughput sequencing technology was used to analyse the dynamic microbial community. Results showed that the denitrifying bacterial genera Acinetobacter, Candidimonas and Longilinea accumulated in denitrification stage and decreased in methanogenesis stage, whereas the fermentation genera Alcaligenes and Thermogutta increased in methanogenesis stage. The genera Methanosphaerula and Methanothrix constituted the dominant archaeal communities. The findings obtained in this work may provide a theoretical basis for treatment with N-heterocyclic compounds under mixed culture.",

Acylpeptide hydrolase (APH) is high research value enzyme which plays a key role in the scavenging of cytotoxic proteins and demonstrated a super efficiency in catalyzing CC bond formation in synthetic applications. Therefore, investigation of the structural and enzymatic properties is necessary. Herein, the results revealed that linker region that directly connects two domains of the monomer involves in stability and catalysis, and N-terminus is critical in mediating temperature-dependent catalysis. Moreover, the N-terminus and the linker jointly serve as bridge regions, that both offer a win-win strategy for catalysis and stability as the result of evolutionary adaptation to the existing environment. Based on these results, a rational design for mutation was proposed to optimize stability and promiscuous catalysis in aldol addition. It is worth noting that the mutant ST-4A (formed by inserting four Ala residues between K331 and G332 at the linker of ST0779) showed better stability and catalytic properties than the wild type, which is suitable for chemical synthesis. This study highlights the important function of bridge regions of APH and the deep understanding of catalysis and structure, provides a new direction for optimized enzymatic transformation and shows the potential value of APH members for synthetic applications.",

Chromatorex® silica resins were utilized to study the dependence of IgG binding upon functional group density, pore size, and specific surface area. The IgG-binding peptide HWRGWV was chosen to demonstrate the potential of combining inexpensive substrates and ligands into efficient, yet disposable, adsorbents. The static binding capacity (SBC) of silica-peptide adsorbents depends significantly on surface area and pore size, yet minimally on ligand density. Chromatorex®-NH2 MB 800 HC (pore size 800 Å, surface area 31 m2/g) and MB 700 HC (700 Å, 44 m2/g) showed SBC of 55 and 75 mg IgG per mL resin, respectively. The dynamic binding capacity (DBC) reached values of up to 60 mg/mL at 5 min residence time, and was found to be almost independent of flow rate, thus offering a much higher productivity (capacity vs. residence time) than Sepharose resins. A selected adsorbent was utilized for purifying monoclonal antibodies from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture supernatants, and polyclonal antibodies from llama and rabbit serum. Under optimized conditions, the silica-peptide adsorbent gave a Mab purity above 90%, 4 log removal of host cell DNA, 1.5 log removal of host cell proteins (HCPs) and Mab recovery of 89% and 92%. Similarly, llama and rabbit IgG were isolated at 80%–85% purity. These results demonstrate that porous silica, a non-traditional substrate for protein purification, shows great promise as potentially single-use affinity adsorbent for protein purification.",

A fixed-film reactor was used in the investigation, whereby the reactor was operated in the up-flow mode under fully submerged conditions at a recirculation ratio of, Qin/QR = 20. The performance of the bioreactor was evaluated over a range of influent U(VI) concentrations [75–100 mg U(VI)/L] and 24 h hydraulic retention time [HRT]. Complete U(VI) removal was observed in phases with 30–85 mg/L influent U(VI). When influent U(VI) was increased to 100 mg/L, approximately 60% U(VI) removal was achieved. The oxidation states of reduced uranium species were determined by Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy followed by X-ray Diffractometer (SEM/TEM-XRD). Earlier studies in batch systems showed that U(VI) was non-toxic to U(VI) reducing organisms at concentrations up to 400 mg/L. The decrease in U(VI) removal efficiency observed in the fixed-film reactor after 42 days was therefore attributed to the accumulation of U(IV) hydroxide precipitates in the reactor. Genetic identification using the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the species Kocuria turfanensis, Arthrobacter creatinolyticus, Bacillus licheniformis, and Microbacterium aerolatum survived from the original cultures. The feasibility of continuous removal of U(VI) in an inoculated indigenous culture system was thus demonstrated.",

In the present study, we aimed to reveal the possible reasons for this deficiency through a series of analytical methods. First, comparative metabolic profiling analysis between the wild-type and mutant strains was performed. Multivariate statistical analysis, including principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, showed that nine potential metabolites were closely associated with the metabolic differences between strains. Second, metabolic flux analysis revealed that an inadequate supply of intracellular acetyl-CoA in the mutant strain could significantly affect the biosynthesis of sophorolipids. In addition, supplementation of citric acid recovered the sophorolipid production in the mutant strain by approximately 83%, suggesting that citrate metabolism plays an important role in sophorolipid biosynthesis. These findings provide novel theoretical insights for further improving the production of sophorolipids in C. bombicola.",

The reactor was filled to 40% with plastic media with a specific surface area of 402 m2  m−3 and was operated at 34 ± 1 °C. Using bio-primer coated media it was shown that a surface nitrogen removal rate of 2.5 g-N m-2 d-1 could be achieved in as little as 56 days. Free ammonia (FA) was thought to be the predominant inhibitor of nitrite oxidizing bacteria activity rather than the selective wash-out of nitrifying biomass. A minimum FA concentration of 2 mg NH3-N L-1 was suggested for optimal performance of partial nitritation and to prevent the build-up of nitrates.

We propose a novel strategy to mimic skin vascularization using newly fabricated hollow fibers made from a biocompatible membrane material, polystyrene, which is hydrophobic if left untreated, or hydrophilic when its surface polarity is modified through plasma-treatment. Caffeine has been well studied in skin penetration assays and was used here to determine the permeation properties of the hollow fibers in a novel jacketed glass bioreactor. For hydrophobic fibers, approximately 87.2% of the caffeine dose did not penetrate the porous surface; 0.2% of the dose was collected after 24 h (permeated through the pores), and therefore 12.6% of the initial dose was suspected to block the membrane. For hydrophilic fibers, both the percentage of the initial dose that permeated and that of blocking caffeine increased to 1.2% and 35.2% respectively. It was concluded that caffeine permeated the hollow fibers at similar times of clearance to those observed in vivo, and therefore shows that this new model could provide a surrogate for capillary-based clearance in in vitro skin absorption studies.",

Inspired by the research, we have herein proposed to modify S-pGMA with cysteine (Cys) to introduce zwitterionic moieties on the polymer backbones. This design was to simultaneously achieve high activation and stability of immobilized CRL on the new supports. S-pGMA modified with low and high (complete) Cys modifications (S-pGMA-Cys-L/H) were synthesized and CRL was coupled via reactions with epoxy groups (CRL-1 on S-pGMA and CRL-2 on S-pGMA-Cys-L) and carboxyl groups (CRL-3 on S-pGMA-Cys-L and CRL-4 on S-pGMA-Cys-H). The results revealed the hyperactivation of the four enzyme preparations. Kinetic study proved that the immobilization resulted in significantly higher enzymatic reaction efficiency and enzyme-substrate affinity than the free enzyme. More importantly, CRL-2, -3, -4, especially CRL-4 on S-pGMA-Cys-H, presented superior thermal stability and pH tolerance than those of CRL-1. Enzyme coupling reaction also significantly affected the enzyme activation and stability. Taken together, the results indicate that zwitterionization of pGMA by modification with Cys is promising to provide supports for immobilized lipase of high activity and stability, and complete modification of Cys was favorable.

Suspended Z. mobilis and S. stipitis in co-culture exhibited poor xylose fermentation due to substrate/product inhibition and catabolite repression. Immobilization in polymeric membranes was effective in alleviating these inhibitions in the SHFMB, which resulted in concomitant fermentation of glucose and xylose at initial glucose and xylose concentrations of 20–80 g L−1 and 10–40 g L−1, respectively. Selective aeration in SHFMB resulted in 100% glucose and >70% xylose fermentation within 48 h, producing 36.7 g L−1 ethanol from 90 g L−1 sugar mixture. Partial immobilization in the membranes allowed Z. mobilis to diffuse in suspension under benign condition, whereas S. stipitis remained inside membrane pores throughout the operation. Xylose fermentation in the SHFMB could be enhanced further by increasing the number of S. stipitis immobilized membranes. Cell immobilization in the SHFMB was stable during 12 consecutive batch runs over 24 days, and exhibited improved xylose fermentation due to gradual increase in S. stipitis accumulation within the membranes.

The biomass of BTA 170 contained 6.5% of ash, 32.25% of carbohydrate, 37.44% of protein, 22.31% of lipid and 1.5% of moisture. 0.3 M of glycine and 5 mM of sodium glutamate were required for BTA 170 as supplements in BG 11 media for maximum yield of cell biomass and PBPs production. However, 6k Lux of light intensity and 14:10 (Light: Dark) of photoperiod were found as optimum for higher productivity. The specific growth rate was found to be 0.228 day−1 and production of PBPs was found to be growth associated. The first-order kinetic model was used to investigate the deactivation process of PBPs and the deactivation rate constant (kd) was found to be minimum in the temperature range from 10 to 40 °C and pH 7. The maximum deactivation of PBPs was found at pH 12 and 80 °C. Gibb’s free energy for PE, PC and APC were found to be 109.38–117.34; 108.10–115.21 and 108.74–116.48 kJ/mol respectively at pH 7. The pH and thermal tolerances of PBPs suggested that they may have potential for use as pigments in industry.",

In this work, the production is carried out using hydrolyzed orange peel wastes (OPW) as a cheap carbon source and a resting cells production process is developed to avoid the nitrogen source costs and to reduce them in the purification processes. A strategy to adapt the strain for the uptake of the mixture of sugars presented in the orange peel hydrolysate is developed in order to improve the fructose and galactose uptake rates.

For this purpose a new and robust control with a time-based stable control structure was used, which had the ability to reconstruct the controller. Moreover, the MLP3 neural network was applied to adjust and optimize the performance of the robust control system. To evaluate the cited strategy, the overproduction of human recombinant alpha 1-antitrypsin (A1AT) under the control of alcohol oxidase 1 promoter (pAOX1) was investigated.

The bacterial adsorption experiments showed that three pure culture could attach properly on chalcopyrite within a short time and the equilibrium data was well fitted with both Langmuir and Freundlich models. Meanwhile, compared to Ferroplasma thermophilum, Leptospirillum ferriphilum and Acidithiobacillus caldus showed coadsorption relationship and owned competitive adavantages in the binary culture system. The adsorption of both Leptospirillum ferriphilum and Acidithiobacillus caldus together promoted the attachment of Ferroplasma thermophilum. The intensified bioleaching assays based on this attachment mechanism showed that the bioaugmentation of the advanced leaching stage by adapated Ferroplasma thermophilum significantly accelerated copper extraction. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) results confirmed the improved biofilm formation by bioaugmentation with adapted Ferroplasma thermophilum.

The post-denitrification process was proposed using the RDBC to degrade the synthetic nitrogen-containing sewage wastewater. When the hydraulic retention time was 16 h, the flow distribution ratio was 3:1 and the anoxic rotational speed was 6 rpm, the effluent NH4+-N and TN were 2.3 mg L−1 and 7.3 mg L−1 with the NH4+-N and TN removal efficiency of 94.1% and 80.9%, respectively.

Fe3+ and CO32− had a strong ability to inhibit uranium biosorption. The biomineralization of uranium by B. thuringiensis 016 was a synergistic effect of enzymes and cell metabolism. In addition, K+, Na+, and Mg2+ slightly promoted the ability of bacteria to mineralize U(VI). Besides, when the initial uranium concentration was 100 mg/L, the reaction of B. thuringiensis 016 with uranium was a rapid process consisting of extracellular biosorption and intracellular biomineralization. When the initial uranium concentration exceeded 200 mg/L, B. thuringiensis 016 can only adsorb uranium. Furthermore, by tracking the concentration of soluble U(VI) in the cells, it was confirmed that the amorphous compounds, formed on the cell surface, were an insoluble form when entering the cells.

Herein, we present a biosynthesis method involving metabolic engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce 13R-MO at an initial titer of 2.3 mg/l. We further optimized the entire MVA pathway, which increased the FPP supply pool, but resulted in a sharp decrease in the 13R-MO production due to low metabolic flux toward geran ylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). To mitigate this, we down-regulated the competing pathway by replacing the original promoter of the squalene synthase gene ERG9 with the MET3 promoter, significantly improving the 13R-MO production to 45.2 mg/l. Finally, three feed strategies were investigated in fed-batch fermentation; the glucose feeding strategy enabled the engineered yeast to produce 167.1 ± 5.2 mg/l 13R-MO, equivalent to 2.6 ± 0.08 mg/l/OD600.

The theoretical optimal conditions were found at a membrane thickness of 1.55 mm, an external resistance of 895.59 Ω and an anode area of 165.72 cm2, corresponding to a maximum absolute power generation of 467.63 μW. The accuracy of the second order model obtained is 88.6%. Thus, the three-factor three-level Box–Behnken-based model designed is an effective tool which provides key information for the optimisation of the energy harvesting from MFC technology and saves time in terms of experimental work.",

     "abstract": "Hydrophobic virus-like organosilica nanoparticles (VOSNs) with a spherical core formed by mesoporous organosilica surrounded by epitaxial perpendicular nanotubes were successfully synthesized for the first time. These hydrophobic VOSNs were used for the immobilization of the lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) via covalent binding method, where glutaraldehyde was used as a spacer to form covalent bonds connect between the enzyme and support. Under optimized immobilization conditions, the specific hydrolytic activity which determined via the hydrolysis of p-NPP was 23200 U/gsupport, and the maximum CALB loading was 115.6 mg/gsupport. Compared to virus-like silica nanoparticles (VSNs), the hydrophobic VOSNs protected the CALB active conformation from a hazardous external environment due to stronger hydrophobic interactions between the VOSNs and CALB molecule. Thus, compared with CALB@VSNs and free lipase, CALB@VOSNs exhibited better pH, thermal stability, organic solvents tolerance and storage stability. The CALB@VOSNs was used to catalyze the esterification reaction of levulinic acid (LA) and n-lauryl alcohol, which was optimized by a response surface method. Under the optimal conditions (temperature, 51.2 °C; LA: n-lauryl alcohol, 1:11.5; time, 22.6 h), the CALB@VOSNs still retained 75.7% of the LA conversion, whereas the N435 only retained 29.8% of the conversion after 9 cycles. These results showed that hydrophobicity VOSNs could be an efficient support to prepare immobilized enzymes as well as to improve the properties of enzymes.",

     "abstract": "The productivity of cold-active polygalacturonase (PGase) in a newly identified marine psychrophile, Thalassospira frigidphilosprofundus S3BA12, was increased multifold by employing high-cell-density (HCD) culturing in a simulation-assisted, custom-designed single-stage-continuous immobilized reactor. The reactor was made “halophilic culturing” ready by using surface altered polyurethane foam (PUF) as a matrix, and it was uniquely packed with layers of “spacers” to increase robustness towards high salinity, prevent salt deposition and dissociation of cells. The basic limitation of low growth of a marine organism was overcome in this study, where HCD resulted in a 4-fold increase of cell mass from 0.84 dcw g/L in submerged culture to 3.22 g/L, which commensurately increased the PGase titre from 21.0 U/ml to 85.25 U/ml. The culture was sustained for 108 h, continuously producing PGase at a rate of 7.87 U/ml hr−1. This could be the highest reported cold-active PGase by any psychrophilic organism reported to date. A mechanistic modelling approach was used to develop a simulation of the process in ChemCAD 5.0, which can be used as a basis for scale-up studies. This study proved statistically that PGase titre is significantly dependent on cell mass using Anderson-Darlington normality tests and established a correlation between PGase and other pectinase subtypes using Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis.",

As cyclic voltammetry indicated, the most electroactive metabolites of Chlorella sp. were produced at 10th-15th day cultures (ca. mid or late exponential growth phase). Microbial community in higher species diversity and evenness owned higher adaptation to stimulate stable bioelectricity-generating capabilities for bioenergy extraction in MFCs. That is, community ecology directly controlled stability of electroactive properties to be fully induced in MFCs.

Two mutagenesis approaches were used here to modify LipJ by addition of common features of family 1.5 lipases, searching for changes on the activity profile. Iterative saturation mutagenesis of a residue possibly involved in Zn2+ coordination produced a LipJ variant –H110N– displaying a remarkable shift in substrate specificity, possibly boosted by changes in number and distance of relevant polar interactions for Zn2+ coordination. Also, variants E27 A, G136 A and M139Q were obtained by site directed mutagenesis as single, double or triple mutants, showing a general shift in specificity towards higher temperature and longer chain-length substrates, all of them displaying higher activity than LipJ on C7 substrates. The results obtained suggest that the N-terminal region of LipJ may indeed contribute to substrate accommodation, whereas mutations at the pentapeptide displayed maximum activity at 50 °C, with the triple mutant showing activity even at 80 °C, greatly enhanced by Mn2+. 3D modelling and molecular docking analysis of selected mutants provided clues for a better accommodation of medium chain-length substrates, and for a modified Zn2+ environment, in agreement with the substrate and temperature profile shifts observed.",

The BTF provided a smooth start-up with an increase in the inlet H2S concentration and delivered a stable operation for more than 300 days. The biomass concentration and microbial community structures were analyzed to determine the biodegradation kinetics, and some key operating variables, the inlet H2S concentration and empty bed retention time (EBRT), were investigated to explore the deodorization performance of the pilot-scale BTF. When the EBRT was 10.9–28.9 s and the inlet H2S concentration was 5–20 ppmv, an H2S removal efficiency of no less than 99% was observed. The elimination capacity (EC) reached 6.58 g H2S/m3/h (removal efficiency of 99.8%) for an EBRT of 10.9 s. In addition, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was integrated with a biodegradation kinetic model and a porous medium model to simulate the deodorization performance of the pilot-scale BTF. Under different operating conditions, the simulated results agreed well with experimental data for H2S concentration profiles and the pressure drop (R2>0.985), which indicates that the established CFD model can be used as a reference for optimizing the design and scale-up of the BTF.",

Experiments were performed in both systems in fed-batch mode under physiological temperature and with a shift to mild hypothermia and the impact on key upstream performance indicators was quantified. Under both temperatures, bioreactors produced a richer HCP pool despite the overall concentration being similar at both scales and temperatures. The number of different HCPs detected in bioreactor supernatants was four times higher than that in flasks under physiological temperature and more than eight times higher under mild hypothermia. The origin of HCPs was also altered from mostly naturally secreted proteins in flasks to mainly intracellular proteins in bioreactors at the lower temperature. Although the number of species correlated with apoptotic cell density in bioreactors, this was not the case in flasks. Even though the level of HCP impurities and mAb/HCP concentration ratio were similar under all four conditions with an average of approximately 330 μg HCP/mL culture and 0.3 mg HCP/mg IgG4, respectively, the fact that culture method significantly affects the number of species present in the supernatant can have implications for downstream processing steps.",

These biosensors translate an internal cellular signal to a transcriptional reporter output. Previous examples have demonstrated transcriptional factor (TF) cross-talk could lead to complex gene expression dynamics. In this report, we formulated a mechanism-based kinetic model to simulate and predict how TF cross-talk reshape the transcriptional dynamics of an engineered biosensor. Our model comprises TF cross-talk and Hill-type equation to quantify the degree of gene repression and de-repression; it also accounts for protein degradation, cell growth (dilution) effect and the carrying capacity of the system. Our simulation fits well with the biphasic parabolic gene expression pattern of an experimentally validated malonyl-CoA sensor. We discovered that exponential growth could lead to hysteresis in the TF cross-talk model. With Logistic growth to limit the carrying capacity, we find that bimodal gene expression pattern could arise, and this phenomenon is rooted in the hysteresis characteristics of the TF cross-talk model. The computational insights obtained in this study will guide us to design accurate, sensitive TF-based biosensors and may serve as a diagnostic platform to troubleshoot the complex transcriptional dynamics in biosensor design. The computational framework developed here will also provide an educational toolbox for synthetic biologist and biochemical/biomolecular engineering students to understand biosystem design and transcriptional regulation.",

The genetic and process performance response of methanotrophs to a gradual 2.8-fold increase in CH4 inlet load in continuous and feast-famine bioreactors was characterized by measuring their pmoA gene transcripts and the CH4 degradation capacities and CO2 production rates, respectively. Both bioreactors exhibited a high robustness in terms of CH4 removal towards CH4 inlet load increase. Higher CH4 elimination and CO2 production during shock load suggested the occurrence of CH4 mass transfer limitations. Consistently, a rapid regulation of the pmoA gene (less than one hour after CH4-shock load), characterized by several transient events of increased expression, was observed in both bioreactors. However, the pmoA gene expression in the feast-famine bioreactor exhibited a less intense response to the increase in CH4 load compared to the continuous system, which suggested a possible adaptation of the pmoA transcriptional response of methanotrophs to the previous history of the culture.",

The electrode exhibited a fast electron-transfer constant (ks) of 8.2 s−1.

In this study, a mathematical model of a granular sludge reactor was applied to investigate the factors that influence N2O emissions from these systems. Individual changes of operating parameters led to large and often non-monotonic changes in the simulated N2O emissions, which could explain the large variety of emissions factors and some apparent contradictions found in literature. Nitrifier denitrification in the outer layer of granules was found to be the main source of N2O. Heterotrophic denitrification acted as a sink in deeper layers, even though this pathway has been neglected in previous modelling studies. The dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration that allows simultaneous low N2O emissions and high nitrogen removal appears to be very site-specific, depending on the wastewater composition and granule size.

     "abstract": "Acid precipitation has been demonstrated as a clarification method for cell culture supernatant (CCS) pretreatment during Immunoglobulin G (IgG) purification. In this study, the responses of IgG, non-histone host cell protein (n-hHCP), histone, and DNA to different pHs in the presence of salt (NaCl) at various concentrations were systematically studied. IgG loss was closely associated with the precipitation of chromatin heteroaggregates, in which DNA/histone showed significant decreases along with the acidification of buffer environment. In addition, DNA showed full recovery after pH neutralization, while the low pH treatment induced histone precipitation was permanent and could not be reverted upon pH increase. Analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) profiles further indicated the agglomeration and reduction of chromatin heteroaggregates along with lower pH. Protein A chromatography benefited from the reduction of chromatin heteroaggregates and showed significant enhancement of the removal of impurities as well as for IgG recovery. For the first time, this study correlated CCS acidification with chromatin heteroaggregate removal and illustrated its ramification for the subsequent purification process.",

However, the efficiency of this method remains controversial due to several unresolved issues, such as the determination of effective nitrate concentration, the optimal injection period, etc. In this study, we investigated the depletion of specific hydrocarbons as the electron donor for sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and nitrate-reducing bacteria (NRB) by varying the nitrate concentration (1.5 mM and 4.5 mM) and injection timing (single, Ns; and multiple Nm) to control souring. Based on analysis of bacterial communities, genus Arcobacter was predominant, followed by NRB of family Rhodospirillaceae, which includes Thalassospira sp. By contrast, in the condition without nitrate addition (Nw/o), genus Desulfotignum was dominant. Both SRB and NRB share similar hydrocarbon preferences: toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene. At the limiting nitrate concentration to suppress SRB activity, 1 mM, SRB could co-exist with NRB and promote a more diverse bacterial community.",

The Henry’s Law constant of the two liquid phase mixtures was obtained as 0.125 kPa m3 mol−1 under the addition of 10% silicone oil. Simulation results revealed that the model is a good tool for evaluating the removal performance of TLPB. Practical applications of the model indicated that an increase in the silicone-oil-to-mixture ratio and inoculated biomass improved the removal efficiency, whereas an increase in the inlet DCM concentration and gas velocity negatively affected the removal performance. Moreover, the model can be used to determine the design parameters and ensure that the outlet concentration satisfies the emission standards. The results of cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that the expenditure for DCM removal per year was low when TLPB was used to treat a high DCM concentration steam with a long empty-bed retention time.",

     "abstract": "This investigation aimed to evaluate the feasibility of potato processing waste (PPW) as a co-substrate for Chlorella vulgaris in batch biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests. Three parameters were examined: C. vulgaris and PPW mixing ratios (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100), PPW type (potato discarded parts (PPWdp) and potato peel (PPWp)), and substrate to inoculum ratio (0.5 and 1.0 SIRs). The mixing ratio was a significant factor with higher methane yields obtained with 25:75 C. vulgaris: PPW. The type of PPW also affected methane yield, as C. vulgaris co-digested with PPWdp increased methane yield by 22–47%, versus a 12–32% enhancement with PPWp. Moreover, a SIR of 1.0 led to an accumulation of soluble COD, resulting in decreased methane yield relative to a SIR of 0.5. Overall, the current study showed that PPW are suitable feedstocks for co-digestion with microalgae, with the enhanced methane yields attributed to a balance C/N ratio. However, the extra nitrogen in the seed inoculum of the BMP test may have obscured the full benefits and hidden some synergistic effects. Therefore, the follow-up studies should be carried out in continuous anaerobic digesters to verify the full potential of PPW as co-digestion substrate for microalgae.",

     "abstract": "Although chloroperoxidase (CPO) has long been recognized as a powerful and versatile catalyst, its applications have been thwarted by the difficulty in regenerating the active enzyme and substrate (peroxide) induced protein inactivation. In this paper, we describe the fabrication and characterization of chloroperoxidase (CPO) and glucose oxidase (GOx) on the surface of MGO. The performance of the immobilized CPO was considerably enhanced by coupling with GOx that provided the required H2O2 in situ through glucose oxidation. The activity of MGO-GOx-CPO (96.6%) towards the decolorization of orange G was much superior to that of MGO-GOx+MGO-CPO (86.2%), probably as a result of reduced mass transfer resistance between CPO and H2O2 generated from GOx molecules. Interestingly, MGO-GOx-CPO reached its peak activity (95.2%) when temperature was maintained between 42 °C and 50 °C compared to the optimal temperature of 35 °C for the free enzyme, possibly due to dispersion of the otherwise stacked MGO below 42 °C. Finally, MGO-GOx-CPO can be conveniently reused for its ease of recovery in the presence of an external magnetic field, with ∼38.5% activity remained after 6 cycles of applications. This work demonstrates the feasibility of co-immobilizing CPO and GOx onto MGO and the potential of MGO-GOx-CPO in environmental applications.",

However, conventional immobilization techniques produce non-uniform particles of millimetric size that may affect the cellular response by limiting nutrient transport into the particles. Droplet-based microfluidics can be an alternative to generate homogeneous and micrometric particles resulting in a reduced nutrient diffusion path when compared to conventional immobilization processes. Although the immobilization process by microfluidics has several applications in biological studies, this technology has been hardly employed in industrial bioprocesses. In this work, we present microfluidics as a potential tool for bacteria immobilization and their use in bioprocess. We studied the immobilization of Bacillus subtilis in alginate microparticles and evaluated their application in batch cultivations to increase the productivity of lipase, an enzyme of commercial interest. Since this is a proof of concept study, we used the free cell cultivation as reference. In comparison with free cell cultivation, the batch cultivation with immobilized cells by the microfluidic technique presented almost 3 times higher lipase production as a result of the high cell concentration. Therefore, the application of a droplet-based microfluidic technique for cell immobilization in alginate microparticles is an alternative to increase productivity in industrial biotechnology.",

To address such issues, Wave bioreactor systems have been developed to provide the insect cells with sufficient dissolved oxygen in a bubble free medium of minimal shear stress. However, selection of rocking parameters, and the methods used to control the processes have not been well described in literature. Herein, oxygen transfer capacity of Wave bioreactor has been investigated at different combinations of rocking parameters. Considering the specific oxygen uptake rates (SOUR) and the assessed oxygen transfer capacity of the Wave bioreactor, rocking parameters were set to cultivate non-infected Spodoptera frugiperda 9 cells and infected/non-infected BTI-TN-5B1-4 cells in 2 L Cellbags. The obtained results were exploited to estimate the SOUR of the insect cells under actual condition of Wave bioreactor system. Furthermore, although Express Five medium was recommended by the supplier, the yield of the active soluble human papillomavirus (HPV) 16L1 protein expression was improved in Sf900 II medium. Using the obtained results, protein expression in BTI-TN-5B1-4 cells was finally scaled up to 50 L confirming that the obtained information could be successfully used to scale the Wave bioreactor by specifying the rocking parameters.",

The mixed electrolytic salts (0 ≤ ionic strength ≤ 0.4126 M) and, to a lesser extent, the glucose (0 ≤ c ≤ 0.222 M) caused the increase of kLa up to a maximum value, followed by a either a slight decrease, or no significant change. The higher values of kLa corresponded to critical concentrations, indicating a maximum inhibition of bubble coalescence. The kLa was governed by changes in interfacial area up to the critical concentrations, where the dominant contribution shifted to kL; at the studied concentrations, the sucrose had no significant effect on kLa. Finally, low concentrations of commercial antifoam caused an overall decrement in kLa due entirely to the hindering effects of antifoams on kL.",

The resulting nanoparticles were used to immobilize the lipase from Candida antarctica Lipase B by linking using glutaraldehyde. The particles in each step were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), vibrating-sample magnetometer measurements (VSM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The magnetic biocatalyst, LCMN was found to have high storage stability and reusability due to the tightly crosslinked structure of chitosan and covalent bond immobilization. LCMNs were used for the oligomerization of itaconic anhydride by ring opening esterification, and the results were compared with those from free lipase and commercial immobilized lipase. The molecular mass of the products obtained with the biocatalysts showed similar Mn profiles with 308–381.

Specific interfacial area in the batch reactor has to be known and its determination was done by measuring droplets size of organic phase by using a microscope. Experimental conversion values of oleic acid obtained in the continuous operation of the CPR, enabled the modelling to give an estimation of the value of the specific interfacial area in the CPR, which was found around 15,000 m2. m−3.

The methodology consists of an algorithm integrating global sensitivity analysis (GSA), functional principal component analysis (FPCA), and rank-clustering techniques. The GSA-FPCA integration removes the time-varying character of GSA (Morris’) indices while the rank-clustering step provides a statistical approach to grouping the ranks of parameter sensitivities as affected by feedstock component variations. To substantiate generalizations of findings, two digestion models of differing complexity were used: Case 1 – single-component feedstock digestion model with substrate inhibition, and Case 2 – rigorous model Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1). Results indicate that 95–99% of the variations in the time-dependent outputs can be captured by the principal components (PCs) after FPCA transformation, and that the first PC is sufficient to represent the model outputs. This capability of the FPCA to capture overall response curve patterns reduces the dimensionality of model response perturbation measures and makes the resulting data projections onto time-independent sensitivity indices intuitive of response curve perturbations. Ranked Morris sensitivity indices calculated from the first PC scores revealed stoichiometric parameters that dominantly affect kinetic responses as well as least sensitive parameters. The GSA-FPCA-Clustering approach elucidates digestion kinetic patterns only obvious under a systematic GSA methodology.",

Using the mixed substrate, final butanol concentrations in a 7 L anaerobic fermentor could reach and stabilize around 9.5–10.5 g/L, which was equivalent to that using 15% pure corn-starch; total sugar utilization yield largely increased from 50% to more than 90%, as disaccharides/trisaccharides were effectively utilized; 53% carbohydrate in the semi-solid was effectively digested which was beneficial for waste amount reduction; 57% expensive corn-starch could be saved.",

Oil palm biomass (OPB) includes empty fruit bunch, mesocarp fibre, palm shell kernel, oil palm fronds and trunks. The production of microbial oils from OPB can be achieved through biochemical routes comprising pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of OPB to produce fermentable sugars (OPB hydrolysates), followed by the cultivation of oleaginous microorganism on OPB hydrolysates. This paper reviews the methods and processes of producing microbial oils and biodiesel from OPB. This paper also presents conceptual microbial oil-based lignocellulosic biorefinery development within the palm oil industry, based on existing and not-yet-explored potential application of microbial oils. OPB-derived microbial oils are a promising non-food feedstock for the production of biodiesel and palm oil substitutes. Biorefining of OPB to microbial oils can be integrated with traditional palm oil processing operations to expand markets for food and oleochemicals. This integrated biorefinery has the potential to generate sustainable outcomes for the palm oil industry.",

It is envisioned that hiPS cells could be an efficient tool for disease modelling and drug therapy testings. However, the successful derivation of hiPS cells to mature hepatocytes remains a challenge as far as the current proposed protocols lead to immature patterns and are very expensive (due to growth factors cost). In this work, we have compared two protocols of differentiation to produce hepatocyte-like cells. The first protocol is the conventional protocol adapted from Si-Tayeb et al. in 2010. By changing the frequency of culture medium exchange, we reduced the use of growth factors in the second protocol by 40%. Both protocols lead to hepatocyte-like characteristics including albumin (ALB) and cytochrome P450/3A4 (CYP3A4) expression in cells. Albumin production reached 2500 ng/mL/day for both protocols. The transcription factor motif activity analysis via transcriptomic data obtained with the Cap Analysis Gene Expression (CAGE) technology confirmed a typical hepatic profile for both protocols (such as activation of HNF1 A and HNF1B promoters). However, specific patterns were also detected with higher mRNA levels of WT1, MTF1, HCFC1, and PGCα1 in protocol 2. The overall transcriptomic analysis also revealed a modulation of targets involved in glucose homeostasis, in cell remodeling, lipid pathways and chromatin processing. However, the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) production remained very high and the function of CYP3A4 was weak in both protocols illustrating still an immature profile in both protocols.",

To see the effect of promoting DIET reaction in the continuous operation, one reactor was operated with electrical energy (0.3 V) input, and the control was also operated at various organic loading rates (0.5–3.5 g COD/L/d, HRT = 20 d). The highest CH4 production rate achieved in the control was 520 mL CH4/L/d at 2.0 g COD/L/d, while the reactor with electrical energy input showed a stable performance up to 3.0 g COD/L/d with 820 mL CH4/L/d.

This study investigated the capability of hydrothermal modification to improve the physicochemical properties of corn stalk carriers for microbial immobilization. Hydrothermal modification can degrade lignocellulosic structure by dissolving part of the components at different conditions. A temperature of 200 °C for 20 min with a carrier side length of 1 cm were selected as the optimal modification conditions. With these conditions, the specific surface area and porosity of the modified corn stalk carriers were 2.44 m2/g and 0.011 cm3/g, respectively, which were twice the values of untreated carriers. Immobilization tests showed that bacteria and yeast grew stably inside the modified carriers and that the immobilized biomass was 49% greater than that of the untreated carriers. After fermentation with bacteria, ethanol production in the modified carrier system was increased by 57% and 99% compared to the untreated carrier system and free bacteria, respectively. These findings confirmed that hydrothermal modification is efficient to improve lignocellulosic carrier properties to achieve better immobilization and fermentation performance, thus benefiting to the utilization of lignocellulosic wastes and their bioconversion processes.",

The supply of plasma-derived butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE) is constrained by the availability of human blood and a complex purification process and its high cost. This constraints necessitates the development of expression platforms capable of large-scale, low-cost production of an active recombinant BChE (rBChE). Traditionally, procainamide affinity chromatography has been used to purify BChE. Recently, an effective affinity chromatography resin based on a potent cholinesterase inhibitor (tacrine-huperzine A hybrid; huperine X termed as Hupresin®) was developed. Here, we describe a purification scheme of rBChE from Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Different extraction buffers were screened for their ability to extract rBChE and native plant proteins. Citrate buffer at pH 4 was selected to minimize extraction of host plant proteins and showed a 4.5-fold enhancement in rBChE specific activity compared to Tris buffer, pH 8. DEAE-Sepharose chromatography increased the purity of rBChE by 70% by removing major host plant protein impurities. The rBChE was then adsorbed to Hupresin® and purified to homogeneity for an overall process yield of 34%. The purification process represents a threefold higher product yield over the established process. Mass spectrometry confirmed the protein sequence and site-specific N-glycosylation analysis was performed.",

This work examined the dynamics of intracellular polymers, functioning as microbial storage (for supplementing re-utilizable carbon source) and compatible solutes (for equalizing the salinity-induced osmotic pressure) respectively, in response to salinity (0–30 g/L NaCl) and evaluated their impacts on glucose transformation in a batch-fed anaerobic digestion (AD) system. Based on the experimental data, a mathematical model was developed to distinguish the stored carbohydrates and compatible solutes, and quantify the metabolic products. The results show a significantly stimulated formation of compatible solutes and a suppressed production of stored carbohydrates and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) under the salinity shock, due to their competition for substrate electrons. Taking into account the dynamics of intracellular polymers, the model in this study provides a more accurate description on the batch AD process under salinity shock than the existing Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) proposed by the International Water Association (IWA).

In this modeling work, a novel approach is presented which transits from a broad mechanistic description of the individual metabolic pathways to a simplified macro-kinetic model. The latter is characterized within the concept of metabolic flux analysis and associated elementary modes, which obey the constraints of phenotype. Unlike the piecewise-defined kinetic expressions with a discrete separate treatment of different cell phases, the Monod equation rate law is extended herein, allowing for a dynamic reversal of macro-reactions, and thus, a uniform continuous functionality from growth to death cultivation periods. The enzymatic biochemical reactions of complete metabolic network are defined to satisfy the composition of mammalian culture structure which reflects on stoichiometry. This affords us an opportunity to handle the density of the viable cells (biomass) along with central metabolisms’ transformations, rather than as a decoupled constituent function, as habitually assumed in the literature. The methodology of the extracellular metabolite measurements for the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells is confronted, confirming the applicability in multi-scale biologically-relevant systems. Temporal species’ behavior reveals inflection points that switch among stages. In further extensions metabolic models have a potential to forecast the outcomes of growth medium perturbations, feeding protocols, and process parameters in order to facilitate the productivity and quality of biosimilars in biotechnology.",

After these two chromatographic steps, non-histone host cell protein (nh-HCP) content in the end-product was reduced to < 1 ppm, DNA was < 1 ppb, aggregates were < 0.05%, and histone HCP was below the detection limit, with an overall process yield of 89.6%. A simplified and seamless two-column-step purification platform with electropositive mixed-mode chromatography as the primary capture strategy was established to provide a more efficient and economical alternative to current prevailing protein A affinity chromatography-based processes.",

     "abstract": "Recently, poly(allylamine) (PAA) of 17.5 and 900 kDa were grafted onto Sepharose FF gel to study protein adsorption and chromatography. In order to further investigate the influences of polymer size and partial charge neutralization, PAAs of 160 and 450 kDa were chosen to synthesize two more types of ion-exchangers (denoted as FF-PAA-M and FF-PAA-ML, respectively). Protein adsorption capacity (qm) of these resins showed a monotonic increasing trend till the maximum ionic capacity (IC) available (970–990 mmol/L), while the uptake rates (De/D0) showed a decreasing-then-increasing trend. The maximum qm and De/D0 reached 328 mg/mL and 0.715, respectively, with FF-PAA-M990 (IC = 990 mmol/L). Partial charge neutralization by modification of FF-PAA-M990 with acetate produced four charge-reduced resins (FF-PAA-Rs), of which the lowest IC reached 210 mmol/L. Both the qm and De/D0 of FF-PAA-Rs presented an increasing-then-decreasing trend with reducing the charge density. The maximum qm obtained with FF-PAA-R860 (IC = 860 mmol/L) was 40% higher than FF-PAA-M990, and all the charge-reduced resins presented 2–3 times higher uptake rates than FF-PAA-M990. Both the qm and De/D0 of FF-PAA-Rs decreased sharply with increasing salt concentration, indicating their increased salt-sensitivities. The FF-PAA-R860 and FF-PAA-R710 columns presented much higher dynamic binding capacities than the FF-PAA-M990 column. FF-PAA-M990 and the charge-reduced resins were suitable for protein chromatography handling feedstocks containing different salt concentrations due to their different sensitivities to ionic strength.",

Attractive ester titers were obtained (up to 800 g.kg−1 for citronellyl acrylate) combined with a depletion of the (heavy boiling) alcohols, simplifying downstream processing. To study the kinetics, all experimentally obtained progress curves were simultaneously used from every conversion as input for nonlinear regression.

Co-occurrence network analysis was used to investigate the interactions between microalgae and bacteria. Results showed that bio-augmentation could increase both microalgal growth and wastewater treatment efficiency. Microalgal biomass increased by 1.2 times. Removal efficiencies of total organic carbon, ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus increased by 5.27%, 3.41%% and 5.74%, respectively. Decreasing trends for Cyanobacteria and Salinarimonas but increasing trends for Cyclobacteriaceae were observed in the microalgal culture system with bio-augmentation. Greater variations of microbial community were found in the treatment without bio-augmentation. Co-occurrence network analysis showed that the main functions of microbial community in the treatment with bio-augmentation were both nutrient removal and organic pollutant degrading. For the treatment without bio-augmentation, main function of microbial community was nutrient removal. It indicated that bio-augmentation increased the number of organic degrading bacteria, such as Bacillus and Paenibacillaceae. The interactions between these bacteria and microalgae promoted the degradation of organic pollutants in the wastewater, providing sufficient inorganic carbon sources for the photosynthesis of microalgae and thus promoting the growth of microalgae and the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater.",

Four types of wastewater using different compositions and dyes (Acid Red 357 and Acid Orange 142) were produced and used in the assays. Three culture conditions were studied. The efficiency of the treatment was assessed in terms of biodecolourization, mycoremediation: reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), total organic carbon (TOC) and biodetoxification. The treatment resulted in between 50–70% of biodecolourization and 40–60% of COD and TOC reduction of the raw wastewater without nutrient addition (N0). However, when wastewaters were supplemented with a high (N1) and a reduced (N0.5) nutrient supply, over 90% of biodecolourization and over 80% of COD and TOC reduction were achieved. The treatment N0.5 allowed the highest values of colour, TOC and COD reduction, which were related to the major peaks of laccase activity (1000–1300 UL−1). The ecotoxicity assays with Raphidocelis subcapitata and Vibrio fisheri demonstrated that the fungal treatment resulted in 50–70% of biodetoxification. The MTT assay revealed that the treated wastewaters did not present cytotoxic effects to the cell line V79.

Further inclusion of 2 mole % of an unsaturated phospholipid accelerated light-triggered drug release, with more than 90% antibiotic release from the liposomes occurring in less than 30 s. With or without laser treatment, ciprofloxacin PoP liposomes inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis in liquid media, apparently due to uptake of the liposomes by the bacteria. However, when liposomes were first separated from smaller molecules with centrifugal filtration, only the filtrate from laser-treated liposomes was bactericidal, confirming effective release of active antibiotic.

We developed a discrete mathematical model to explore the factors affecting the distribution of aerial hyphae with height above the surface and adjusted the model parameters by fitting the model to literature data of Rhizopus oligosporus growing on potato dextrose agar. The adjusted rules were simple and indicate that vegetative aerial hyphae grow in any direction, as though their tips moved in a random-walk fashion. Vegetative aerial hyphae stop extending when they enter crowded spaces, resulting in a maximum local biomass concentration. With these rules, the layer model was used to study the influence of increasing inoculum concentration and to simulate, for the first time, growth between the surfaces of two adjacent particles.",

The model was used to simulate fed-batch fermentations at different temperatures, with the same total substrate concentration, resulting in satisfactory descriptions of the process behaviors. A new optimization strategy to obtain the maximum possible ethanol production, based on the CEmax parameter of the Andrews-Levenspiel kinetic model, provided ethanol production of up to 134.7 g L-1 (17.1°GL) at 28 °C and 305.4 g L−1 substrate.

The gas-lift bioreactor configuration was characterised using a non-coalescent medium at working volume-specific volumetric gas flow rates of up to 20 L L−1 h−1, showing mean gas bubble diameters of up to 0.57 mm, volumetric power inputs of up to 23 W m-3, gas-liquid mass transfer coefficients of up to 153 h−1 (CO) and up to 122 h−1 (H2), mixing times (θ90) of down to 0.5 min and gas hold-ups of up to 1.2%. A comparison of autotrophic batch processes with Clostridium aceticum and Clostridium carboxidivorans in the stirred-tank (2.0 L) and the retrofitted gas-lift bioreactor (2.5 L) at identical operating conditions showed differences in the cell dry weight and product concentrations (acetate, ethanol, butyrate, 1-butanol, hexanoate, 1-hexanol) due to gas-liquid mass transfer limitations caused by the reduced power input in the gas-lift bioreactor. CO limitation was demonstrated by a myoglobin-protein assay for CO measurement in the liquid phase. The simple retrofitting of a stirred-tank bioreactor for gas-lift operation thus provided comparative data on process performances of acetogenic bacteria that convert synthesis gas in gas-lift and stirred-tank bioreactors on a lab-scale.",

For this purpose, we established chemostat fermentation of P. pastoris for rHBsAg production in bench-scale for two weeks. The specific and volumetric productivity for chemostat fermentation were 0.00468 mg HBsAg/g cell/h and 1.699 mg HBsAg/L/h, respectively. These parameters for fed-batch fermentation were 0.00456 mg HBsAg/g cell/h and 1.38 mg HBsAg/L/h, and by considering the downtime for harvesting and initiating the next run, these values dropped to 0.00375 mg HBsAg/g cell/h and 1.13 mg HBsAg/L/h, respectively.

To enable successful large-scale manufacture of hMSC therapies, increased product consistency and yield, and a reduced batch-to-batch variation must be achieved. This paper addresses ways to reduce variation by controlling the processing conditions, in particular the dissolved oxygen concentration (dO2), and the culture medium. Bone marrow derived hMSCs were cultured in DASGIP DASbox bioreactors on Plastic P-102L microcarriers in FBS-containing and serum free (SFM) media at various dO2 values from 100% to 10%, experiencing the same dO2 value throughout the culture process. The superior control of pH and dO2 in the bioreactor led to improved performances compared to poorly controlled spinner flasks, particularly at reduced dO2 concentrations. At 25% dO2, there was a 300% increase in the BM-hMSC yield in the bioreactor across the two donor BM-hMSCs in SFM compared to FBS-containing medium. Overall, the process yield increased by an average of around 500% for both donors under controlled conditions in SFM at 25% dO2 in the bioreactor compared to the poorly controlled expansion at atmospheric conditions in FBS-containing medium in spinner flasks. Process control significantly reduced the BM-hMSC variation in yield from 79.1% in FBS-containing medium in spinner flasks to <15% in controlled SFM bioreactor culture.",

The oil extraction yields for the three solvents were 13.6%, 12.3%, and 7.0%, respectively.

However, the impact of ILs as adjuvants on the partition of biomolecules is still poorly understood. Previous works mostly focused on ATPS based on strong salting-out agents, which may mask the IL effect. In this work, ATPS formed by polyethylene glycol (PEG 400) and a weak salting-out salt ((NH4)2SO4) with a wide number of ILs as adjuvants (chloride-based combined with cholinium, imidazolium, pyrrolidinium, piperidinium, tetralkylammonium and tetralkylphosphonium cations) were investigated. The respective phase diagrams were determined, and the systems extraction performance for a wide range of biomolecules (phenolic compounds, alkaloids and amino acids) was investigated. The results obtained show that ILs as adjuvants in polymer-salt ATPS modulate the partition of biomolecules. In particular, more hydrophobic ILs significantly enhance the partition of more hydrophobic biomolecules to the PEG-rich phase (where the IL is enriched). Furthermore, the intensity of the IL effect is more pronounced when using weak salting-out agents. A linear correlation between the biomolecules and the ILs partition coefficients, and with the biomolecules octanol-water partition coefficients, was found. In most ATPS formed by polymers and salts using ILs as adjuvants, the biomolecules partition is driven by the ILs partition and by the difference in hydrophobicity between the coexisting phases.",

The addition of the biocarriers increased the relative abundance of filamentous bacteria within the HMBR, which decreased the settleability of the sludge, but did not affect its dewaterability or filterability. Settleability was found to be strongly correlated to the biocarrier filling ratio (R2 = 9.0). The biocarriers appeared to have no effect on the total concentration or protein-to-polysaccharide (PN/PS) ratio of the mixed liquor EPS. However, an analysis of the fouled membranes revealed that the PN/PS ratio of the cake layer EPS was significantly reduced in the presence of the biocarriers. It was also found that the biocarriers reduced the fouling rate of the HMBR and extended its operating time by up to 40% (or 11 days). This rate reduction could not be attributed to any mechanical scouring mechanism, since the biocarriers were prevented from contacting the membrane module during operation.",

     "abstract": "Methods based on electrochemical biosensors have been developed for detection of microRNA-21 (miRNA-21), but most involve complicated labeling or stripping procedures and are unsuitable for routine use in diagnosis/treatment of IgA-nephropathy. Herein we report on the proof-of-concept of simple and sensitive potentiometric DNA biosensor for specific detection of miRNA-21 coupling and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) with target recycling. This system consists of two hairpin DNA probes and one single-stranded DNA (capture probe). To decrease the background signal, the thiolated capture probe is covalently conjugated onto a cleaned gold electrode through typical Au-S bond. Upon target miRNA-21 introduction, the analyte opens hairpins DNA in turn to propagate the CHA reaction between two alternating hairpins accompanying the release of target miRNA-21 for recycling, thereby resulting in formation of numerous nicked double-helixes. Meanwhile, the newly produced CHA product hybridizes with the immobilized capture DNA probe on the electrode, thus causing the change in the surface charge density for potentiometric measurement. Under optimum conditions, CHA-based DNA biosensor presents good potentiometric responses for determination of target miRNA-21 at a level as low as 43 fM. An intermediate precision of <10% is accomplished with the batch-to-batch identification. The specificity and stability of CHA-based biosensor are satisfactory. Importantly, CHA-based potentiometric biosensor offers promise for the label-free, rapid, simple, cost-effective analysis of biological samples.",

The individual inhibitors – vanillin, syringaldehyde, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamaldehyde, exhibited toxicity on suspended cells, whereas simultaneous exposure to multiple inhibitors was detrimental for the cells. In contrast, the immobilized cells showed excellent growth and glucose uptake in the presence of these inhibitors, and the microorganisms achieved 95% of the theoretical ethanol yield under highly inhibitory conditions. ICHFMB performance could be improved significantly by increasing the flow rate of the hydrolysate over the membranes, and by increasing the number of membranes, indicating that diffusion through the membranes was an important factor during the fermentation. Z. mobilis showed gradual acclimatization to the presence of inhibitors as they were slowly released from the membrane pores into suspension, and enhanced glucose uptake rate and ethanol productivity. Cell immobilization within the membranes was also found to be very stable as the ICHFMB performance did not deteriorate during 20 consecutive runs under identical conditions.

For this reason, alternatives to these fuels that are less polluting, such as biofuels, have been sought. These can be produced from hydrolysates containing glucose and xylose. Metabolic engineered microorganisms are required to consume both sugars and to improve the feasibility of these processes. In this paper, the production of ethanol is evaluated using a medium that simulates a hydrolysate of corn stover (25 g/L xylose, 35 g/L glucose) with the metabolic engineered Escherichia coli strain MS04. The influence of the initial concentration of biomass on the production of ethanol was analyzed. With the experimental results, a technical and economic analysis of the entire process is performed with the Aspen Plus software. As a result, it is highlighted that the initial concentration of biomass only affects the fermentation time since, at a lower concentration, a longer fermentation time is required to reach a final ethanol concentration of 30 g/L. The scale of the process influences the distribution of costs is influenced by the scale of the process. On a larger scale, the raw materials represent the higher share and the depreciation on the smaller one. The use of a metabolic engineered strain allows the better use of the obtained hydrolysates from agroindustrial residues.",

The biooxidation of Mn by the CL11 strain may involve indirect mechanisms which alter the pH of the medium, whereas the LG1 strain may use a direct mechanism for the biooxidation mediated by cellular components such as intracellular proteins. These results demonstrate the biotechnological potential of the two strains. In addition, is the first time the high potential of the NB medium for Mn removal is demonstrated. This medium was found to greatly influence the Mn removal and oxide formation, especially in the case of the pigmented LG1 isolate.",

Efficient purification is necessary for preparation of HBc-VLP and its derivatives with various foreign epitopes. In previous reports, HBc-VLP was mainly purified with ion exchange chromatography. In this study, we developed a platform purification technique based on hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). The underlying principle is the strong hydrophobicity on the surface of HBc-VLP, which was found by mathematical calculation and experimental measurement. Based on HIC, a complete downstream process, from feedstock supernatant to the final pure product, was developed involving a heat pretreatment, an HIC, an ultrafiltration concentration and a size exclusion chromatography. The total recovery of HBc-VLP was 41.92% with nearly 100% purity. HIC was also applicable to three HBc-based vaccine candidates displaying epitope from nuclear protein (NP) and matrix protein 2 (M2e) of the influenza A virus, as well as from ovalbumin (OVA). Optimal HIC condition for these three recombinant VLPs was rationally designed by analysis on their surface hydrophobicity, which was influenced upon insertion of the foreign epitope. By applying the same process developed for HBc-VLP, satisfactory results were achieved for product recovery, purity and host cell DNA removal, thus it is possible to become a platform technique for various HBc-VLP based vaccine candidates.",

Lots of work has been done determining relevant process engineering parameters to enable reliable scale-up on a physical foundation. However, heat transfer capabilities of such systems are not well described, yet. As processes are further intensified and microbial hosts offer interesting opportunities, heat transfer becomes increasingly relevant. The present work gives a comprehensive overview on the specific implications of a stirred, 50 L, single-use bioreactor by means of heat transfer. This includes the dependency of overall heat transfer coefficients on process parameters, i.e. stirring frequency and jacket flow, with a corresponding statistical analysis. Experimental results are compared against a theoretical approach, based on Nu numbers. Although a systematic discrepancy on the description of the jacket-side heat transfer is present, there already is a good agreement between experimental and literature derived values. The jacket-side impact on the overall performance is then analyzed in detail by the Wilson plot method, underlining the major influence of this aspect. Since the polymer-film layer represents a significant feature of single-use bioreactors, this effect has been investigated for two film types as well. Finally, a first comparison of the 50 L against a 200 L bioreactor was carried out to identify scale-dependencies.",

With a view of a co-treatment process of the slop with other wastewaters, sodium acetate, as external co-substrate, was supplied (high dosage – Period 1, low dosage – Period 2) to evaluate its effects on hydrocarbons removal. The MBR pilot plant enabled approximately 99% of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) removal during the entire experiment, confirming the robustness of the MBR technology for the treatment of slops. The chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis showed that the removal efficiency for each alkane was close to the value observed for total mixture removal (>99%) and the hydrocarbons removal was mostly due to the microorganism-mediated biodegradation. The biological contribution to TPH removal increased from approximately 85% to 98% when the co-substrate was decreased. Biomass kinetics revealed that a lower co-substrate dosage enhanced the growth of bacterial groups able to use hydrocarbons as primary substrate. A clear predominance of Microthrix Parvicella under low co-substrate dosage was observed. However, the lower co-substrate addition caused a significant worsening in the physical properties of the activated sludge, which resulted enriched in soluble exopolymers (>70%), more hydrophobic (>90%) and with small and dispersed flocs (<30 μm). Consequently, the membrane permeability reduced because of the irreversible fouling increase.",

Mono- and co-digestion experiments were performed at batch and continuous reactor operation. The mono-digestion of wastewater microalgae led to the highest methane yield (408 ± 34 N mL/gVS). However, for manure-based biogas plants, a 60:40 v/v piggery slurry to wastewater microalgae ratio in terms of organic matter was identified as the most efficient mixture in batch assays (355 ± 27 N mL/gVS). The advantage of co-digestion was also evidenced under continuous reactor operation, which had markedly higher biogas production (23%, p < 0.05) compared to the mono-digestion of livestock manure. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the co-digestion process resulted in a more robust process as indicated by lower accumulation of acetate (i.e. presented during mono-digestion of piggery slurry) and propionate (i.e. recorded during mono-digestion of wastewater microalgae). The experimental data were compared with dynamic modelling (BioModel). A new set of biodegradability parameters was estimated and employed to improve the simulations of mono-digestion scenarios. Subsequently, the co-digestion scenario was used for model validation. Results obtained from simulations showed that the co-digestion can lead to relatively high methane productivity and prevent process instabilities.",

Generalized rules for improved toxicity were also developed, which stated that improved drug carriers should have at least 4 hydrogen bond donors, between 4 and 6 freely rotating bonds, an isoelectric point above 5.5, and a log P between -2 and -1.

Adsorption equilibria of hIgG adsorption showed that by far the maximum adsorption capacity for hIgG in Sepharose-based protein A gels was determined to be about 120.0 mg/g gel. Its excellent performance was further manifested by the result of dynamic binding capacity. In protein A gel, moreover, there was a critical density around 20 mg/g gel, above which the availability of the ligand decreased rapidly due to serious steric exclusion effect.

The UDP-rhamnose synthase (VvRHM) gene from Vitis vinifera was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and characterizations of VvRHM were determined. The N-terminal region of VvRHM was fused with the bifunctional UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose 3,5-epimerase/UDP-4-keto-rhamnose 4-keto-reductase (NRS/ER) from Arabidopsis thaliana to obtain the fusion enzyme (VvRHM-NRS), which was NADPH-independent and could convert UDP-glucose to UDP-rhamnose with NADH self-sufficient. The optimal activity of VvRHM-NRS was at pH 7.5 and 30 °C. Apparent Km and Vmax of VvRHM-NRS for UDP-glucose were 88 ± 9 μM and 12.7 ± 0.6 nmol/min/mg, and for NAD+ were 69 ± 7 μM and 11.9 ± 0.5 nmol/min/mg. Then, a novel process for the synthesis of UDP-rhamnose from sucrose, NAD+, and UDP was developed by using VvRHM-NRS coupled with Glycine max sucrose synthase (GmSUS). By optimizing coupled reaction conditions, UDP-rhamnose production reached 0.57 mM. Finally, UDP-rhamnose regeneration system was tested to synthesize quercitrin with A. thaliana glycosyltransferase (AtUGT78D1). Therefore, VvRHM-NRS coupled with GmSUS presented a green chemistry approach for the UDP-rhamnose regeneration in glycosylation of flavonoids and other bioactive substances.",

In this study, we applied CRISPR/Cas9 to edit the GABRR2 gene in mouse retinal ganglion cells to study what exactly happened in two alleles and what real mRNA isoforms formed in diploid cells. A single sgRNA was employed to generate double-strand DNA breaks. PCR sequencing was used for single clone validation in diploid cells subjected to editing. The indels and the corresponding effects at the target locus were further studied at genomic and RNA levels. We observed that CRISPR/Cas9 induces random deletions in the target region of GABRR2 gene, and both big and small indels can lead to unexpected high probability of exon truncation/skipping. In addition, random deletions in genomic region recruited introns to generate new “exon”. It is the first observation of exon recruitment by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated GABRR2 gene editing.

Strain PGC11505, in which the gene (YlACH1) of acetyl-CoA hydrolase corresponding for acetic acid overflow was deleted, exhibited the ability to utilize glucose for succinic acid production efficiently. Strain PGC202, with a strengthened reductive carboxylation and oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle by overexpression of ScPCK and endogenous YlSCS2, yielded 23.8 g/L succinic acid.

However, these investigations have lacked rigorous analysis of energy requirements, with the energy required at best being estimated using simplified assumptions. A detailed assessment of the energy requirements for gas stripping is presented in this work. This includes a rigorous analysis of the key operating variables of 21 experimental mass balance data sets from 16 investigations in the literature. Higher butanol concentrations in the culture and higher stripping temperatures are shown to be the two most significant parameters influencing the energy efficiency of the process. Gas stripping with distillation consumes 34.2 to 380 MJ/kg butanol and is 41–370% less energy efficient than the use of distillation only for product recovery.

Under the optimum conditions, the photoluminescence intensity via the CQD-SiNP-labeled strategy exhibited high sensitivity, and allowed the detection of target p53 as low as a concentration of 2.7 pg mL−1. No interfering signals were acquired toward non-target analytes including biomarkers or enzymes in human serum. Below 15% of relative standard deviations (RSDs) were obtained for detection of p53 analyte in all cases. Additionally, CQD-SiNP-based photoluminescence immunoassays were utilized for the evaluation of real human serum samples, and received well-matched results with commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit.",

The FFB continuous reactor was fed with formic acid as an inducer at a COD/SO4-2 of 0.76 with 2-CP concentrations of 0.19, 0.27 and 0.39 mmol/L, achieving a maximum degradation of 39% of 2-CP at 0.19 mmol/L. The degradation capacity of 2-CP in the bioreactor decreased as the concentration of the toxic compound increased, and a proportional diminution of sulfate consumption was observed. On the other hand, an SB reactor was fed under similar conditions and using the same 2-CP concentrations for comparison. In this case, a maximum degradation of 51% of the 2-CP was observed at 0.19 mmol/L. Sulfate consumption followed the same pattern as in the FFB reactor.

A premise for bioleaching studies integrating X-ray μCT is that the metabolic activity of microorganisms is not affected by X-ray energy doses. This study therefore evaluates the compatibility of bioleaching microorganisms with X-ray energy exposure. The X-ray effect on a mixed thermophilic culture suspended in solution was assessed using imaging conditions of 35–150 kV, 200–280 μA and 1–2 hours. Microorganisms were unaffected between 35–90 kV and 200–280 μA while there was some detrimental effect at 120 and 150 kV. The X-ray influence on a mixed mesophilic culture colonising a mineral surface was investigated at 90 kV and 225 μA for a 1 h exposure time. The system was monitored before and after exposure through measurement of: redox potential of the effluent solution, microbial cell concentration, heat output from the colonised surface using isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC), and cell attachment on the ore surface using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The redox and cell concentration measurements showed insignificant differences between exposed and unexposed samples. Equivalent heat generation and good colonization of the mineral surface was demonstrated, confirming continued microbial activity post exposure, hence recommending its use in support of bioleaching studies.",

Within 4.5 Å of three catalytic residues of Amy7C, three mutations R172 K, A270 K and N271H were identified by computational homology modeling and pKa prediction analyses. Five single and double mutants consisting of these three mutations were constructed and characterized. Compared to the wild-type, all mutants shifted the pH optima and pH-activity profiles toward lower pH values without comprising the thermostablity. Double mutants showed simultaneous accumulation of advantageous mutations. The best mutant, A270 K/N271H showed 2 units decrease in optimum pH and about 3.94-fold increase of catalytic efficiency. Structural analysis suggested that the improved acidic adaptation could be attributed to the decreased pKa values of catalytic nucleophile and proton donor residues.

Results showed that ultrasonic pretreatment was beneficial to the dissolution of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) from the waste activated sludge, coupled with the rapid degradation in the dewatering performance of the sludge. In the succeeding anaerobic digestion, when sonication of the treated sludge was more than 80 min, the removal rate of total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) and the sludge reduction rate also decreased significantly. Gas and methane productions were highest at the reactor fed with sludge sonicated at 80 min.

These were at times corresponding to 28 and 58.5% the overall growth extent as measured by absorption; for 1 L cultures in 2.5 L shake flasks in our incubator, this amounted to 201 min and 255 min respectively. The cell pellet was washed in S30 buffer once for 10 min and stored at −80°C without flash freezing in nitrogen. Cell lysis was simplified by diluting the cells to one part S30 buffer, one part DI water, and one part cells by mass and then passing through a continuous French press for one cycle at 25,000 psi. The resulting suspension is clarified with one low speed centrifugation step at 12,000×g for 10 min (4°C). All extract is then immediately frozen in a pilot-scale lyophilizer (−70°C) and dried under optimal conditions determined as 4 h under vacuum (200 mTorr) while holding a shelf temperature of 15°C. The lyophilized extract showed no statistically significant difference in sfGFP expression levels when compared to an optimized, lower-volume sonication protocol and improved performance over extract from commercial kits.

However, a significant percentage of genes cannot be expressed efficiently in a cell-based system due to cellular homeostasis. Upon overproduction, proteins often form inclusion bodies by becoming insoluble, lose biological activities due to improper folding, or are easily degraded by proteases. Many molecular tools and protocols have been established to improve the production yield of ‘difficult-to-express’ proteins in cell-based systems; however, in vivo approaches have a substantial limitation in that the host strains should be maintained healthy for stable protein production and folding. Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) offers superior advantages in synthesizing ‘difficult-to-express’ proteins due to reaction environment openness and no cell viability constraints. In CFPS systems, active protein production can be maximized by optimizing the reaction environment with selective supplements of positive effectors and the elimination of negative effectors.

In this study, we investigated the effect of the immobilization position on the stability of CA using α-type Bovine CA (bCAII). Six candidate residues (K9, K36, T85, D151, E233, or N252) were selected and each Cys mutant was site-specifically immobilized on the magnetic beads. The thermal and long-term stabilities were compared. Interestingly, the immobilized K9C and K36C, in which the immobilized sites are located close to the N-terminus of bCAII, showed 4.0- and 9.8-fold enhanced thermostability, respectively, at 58 °C. They also maintained 60.6% and 55.5% of activity, respectively, at 45 °C after 20 days, when the wild-type bCAII (free and randomly immobilized) completely lost its activity. These results indicated that the site-specific immobilization of the flexible residues on the N-terminal region could be an effective strategy for the stabilization of bCAII, which would be useful guidelines for the immobilization of other CAs in a site-specific manner.",

These eutectic solvents are easily accessible, biodegradable, and inexpensive alternatives to conventional ionic liquids. Herein, the DESs compared with 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and methanol were studied by evaluating enzyme activity and enzyme stability; and a novel DES, choline chloride: propylene glycol (ChCl:PG, 1:2) was believed to be the most appropriate solvent to improve the bioconversion efficiency. When ChCl:PG (40%, v/v) as a co-solvent, β-glucosidase activity was increased to 225% compared to buffer system. Moreover, the enzyme thermal stability in ChCl:PG retained 62% of their initial activity in the fifth day, which was superior to phosphate buffer solution and methanol. On the contrary, the enzyme was mostly deactivated in pure DESs, while adding a certain amount of water was able to eliminate the adverse effects. It can be concluded that the water content in the solvent system will significantly affect the activity of solvent on enzymes.

     "abstract": "Hierarchically structured, porous carbon materials (PCM) were synthesized by sucrose infiltration into template material and subsequent carbonization. Three porous carbon materials were prepared using porous concrete (PCM-01) or silica gel (PCM-02 and 03) as template. Carbon particles from 125 to 200 μm were generated. Surface carboxylic group density was determined with 1.1 mmol/g dry material for each variant. Firstly, tailor-made PCM was evaluated as suitable support for lipase immobilization. Recombinant produced lipase of Thermomyces lanuginosus (TLL) was used as model enzyme. Two independent crude immobilization strategies were applied. Residual activities of up to 8.6 U/g and 31 U/g dry material for adsorptive and covalent immobilization (linkage via EDC) were achieved, respectively. Additionally, TLL was immobilized on commercially available polymethacrylate support showing similar residual lipase activities. Secondly, covalent immobilization was optimized to generate reproducible, highly stable and active immobilizates. Optimized covalent immobilizates showed residual activities of up to 10 U∙g−1 dry carbon material using p-nitrophenyl-palmitate assay and protein loads of up to 45 mg g−1 dry carbon material. Covalent bound TLL-PCM showed storage stability for 12 months, remaining 100% of the initial activity. Operational stability resulted in stable and 100% active immobilizates over five consecutive cycles of use. Experiments showed that tailor-made porous carbon material is a promising support for lipase immobilization, which is adaptable in shape and dimension.",

Six GMA-IDA-grafted resins of the same grafting density but different chain lengths (ionic capacities, ICs) were synthesized and denoted as FF-Br2-pG-In (n denotes for IC value). Lysozyme adsorption and chromatography were studied to evaluate the cation exchangers. It was found that resins of moderate IC values (FF-Br2-pG-I480 and FF-Br2-pG-I590) afforded lysozyme adsorption capacities higher than 300 mg/mL at 50 and 100 mmol/L NaCl, over three times higher than the commercial resin CM Sepharose FF. Beside, the uptake rate (De/D0) of lysozyme decreased with increasing IC at 50 mmol/L NaCl because of the increased polymer chain length that limited surface diffusion of the bound protein. Protein adsorption capacities of FF-Br2-pG-I480 and FF-Br2-pG-I590 kept higher than that of CM Sepharose FF in the salt concentration range of 0–150 mmol/L, and the uptake rates on the two resins increased with increasing salt concentration. Therefore, the dynamic binding capacities of them were remarkably higher than that of CM Sepharose FF and kept over 70 mg/mL at the salt concentration up to 150 mmol/L. The results demonstrated that GMA-IDA-grafted resins are promising for use as high-capacity protein chromatography.",

Hence, this paper was designed to study the temperature effect in the mesophilic range (20, 25, 30 and 35 °C) on biohydrogen production in AnSBBR (anaerobic sequencing batch biofilm reactor) that co-digested dairy industry effluent (cheese whey) and biodiesel production effluent (glycerin). Influence of the inoculum heat shock pretreatment and micronutrients solution added to influent were also assessed. The best condition for hydrogen production was at the temperature of 30 °C, in which it was achieved a productivity of 129.0 molH2. m−3.d-1 and a yield of 5.4 molH2.kgCOD-1. Both micronutrient solution and inoculum pretreatment were proven necessary for a better hydrogen productivity. Productivity increased until 30 °C, but at 35 °C the exacerbated amount of biomass produced caused a rapid decrease in hydrogen production. From the kinetic model, it was observed that the majority of hydrogen production comes from the acidogenesis phase (k1H = 1.4 h-1, k3H = 1.4 h-1, k4H = 1.4 h-1). The calculated kinetic constants were used to estimate the activation energy of each reaction of the acidogenesis phase by using the Arrhenius model: 110–220 kJ.mol-1.",

Pyruvate kinase- (PPYK) and pyruvate decarboxylase- (PPDC) promoters around pyruvate-node were determined as promising candidates, and in silico analysis of the putative promoter regions was performed. The putative promoters were introduced into the plasmid pGAPZαA::hGH harboring human growth hormone (hGH) gene, instead of PGAP. Single-copy hGH gene carrying strains under PPYK, PPDC, and for comparison under PGAP were tested in high-cell-density rhGH fermentations, respectively, abbreviated as BRPYK, BRPDC, and BRGAP. Comparative promoter strength assessment was made by the mRNA-transcription-copy-number (mTCN) and r-protein concentration measurements, and by constrained flux analysis.

The photocatalytic process would partially oxidize the biological persistent compound to produce biodegradable intermediates. Simultaneously, the biological reactions by microorganisms were available during the photocatalytic process to assist the rapid degradation of the biodegradable intermediates as soon as they are produced. The phenol removal was initially evaluated through single photodegradation and biodegradation process. Phenol with concentration of 100 mg/L was removed by 72% after undergoing photocatalytic reaction. Moreover, the range of phenol removal efficiency through biodegradation at 100 mg/L was between 50–70 %. Phenol removal efficiencies were improved in PHSBR with different concentrations (25, 50 100 and 300 mg/L) evaluated. The total mineralization measured through COD removal could be achieved up to a phenol concentration of 50 mg/L. The average phenol removal efficiency increased up to 90% and above for all concentrations. The results demonstrate that simultaneous reaction allowed higher mineralization rates of phenol and the stability of biodegradation performances indicated the effectiveness of the simultaneous reaction.",

Heterogeneities of substrate distribution (availability) can also strongly limit current in MFCs. In this work we investigate how mass transport can be enhanced by changing the flow configurations in MFCs, e.g. by directing the flow through a porous anode or by applying inserts and channels to anodes. Experimental results using a perpendicular flow through the anode were compared to a parallel flow setup, showing increased current output. Finite element method (FEM) simulations were used to simulate the flow profiles and substrate distribution in each setup. The simulations revealed higher average substrate concentrations for the perpendicular flow through a porous carbon fabric anode vs. a parallel flow in the bulk phase of the MFC, related to the enhancement of transport via convection in perpendicular flow. The simulated substrate distributions found for the different inlet setups could be correlated to the experimentally obtained current flow, power output and biofilm distribution. It can be concluded that the increased current output can be explained by the flow profile in the system resulting in an increased substrate distribution in the biofilm on the electrode and a hindered oxygen transport from the cathode.",

The start-up time was shortened and the maximum power density obtained by using NF/rGO (36.4 mW m−2) was eight times higher against bare NF. Graphene further improve the maximum tolerable concentrations of Cd(II) in the algal-cathode, which estimated to be 50 ppm. Using NF/rGO electrode, the algal-cathode MFC achieved a high Cd(II) removal efficiency of almost 95% and a maximum adsorption amount of 115 g m−2.

The tool comprised models for whole bioprocess economics linked to uncertainty analysis, dynamic scheduling, brute-force optimisation and multi-attribute decision-making. The tool was used to determine the cost of goods (COG), robustness, operational ease and business feasibility of competing cell culture technologies under different scale, demand, reimbursement and dose size scenarios, and to determine the performance improvements required for commercial success. The results revealed that in low annual demand (10 billion cells/year) scenarios, multi-plate bioreactors have superior operational and economic characteristics. At larger annual demands (10 trillion cells/year), however, the tool predicts that microcarrier-based bioreactors are optimal due to their relative cost-effectiveness and operational benefits conferred by their closed and controlled characteristics that outweigh the uncertainties associated with their use. Moreover, whilst further analysis of high dose, high demand (1 billion cells/dose, 10,000 doses/year) scenarios has shown that significant improvement in the performance of cell culture processes may result in satisfactory COG, current limitations in the capacity of downstream processing (DSP) technologies may not allow full market capture.",

Seven different process flowsheets were compared and the economic drivers of manufacturing costs were analysed. COG per dose values were compared against a specified target selling price (TSP) to understand the feasibility of achieving a target COG as % TSP. Finally, a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) analysis was conducted in order to allow preference of process design to be determined on the basis of qualitative and quantitative operational attributes, rather than COG alone. The flowsheet containing rocking motion bioreactors, spinning membrane filtration technology and a MACS purification platform was found to result in the lowest COG value. The MADM analysis indicated that this was also the preferred flowsheet when qualitative operational attributes were also considered.

It was found that lysozyme adsorption capacity increased with increasing IC value, but the uptake rate (De/D0) on S-Alg-FF-370 was small (0.070) at 0 mmol/L NaCl because of the strong binding that limited surface diffusion of the bound protein. However, the dynamic binding capacity (DBC) of S-Alg-FF-370 was much higher in the salt concentration range of 0–150 mmol/L than the lower IC resins due to its high adsorption capacity and increased uptake rate. Especially at 150 mmol/L NaCl, the DBC of S-Alg-FF-370 was about 7.3 times higher than Alg-FF-230 and kept over 70 mg/mL at the flow rate up to 1350 cm/h. The results proved the high salt-tolerant feature of S-Alg-FF-370. By contrast, S-Alg-FF-270 showed higher DBC values than S-Alg-FF-370 in the same flow rate range at 50 mmol/L NaCl. Hence, S-Alg-FF-270 and S-Alg-FF-370 displayed different properties that would make them favorable for use in protein purification at different salt concentrations.

The model accounts for carbon catabolite repression as well as the inhibition of kinetic rates at high substrate concentrations (∼90 g l−1). Model parameters were obtained through kinetic fitting to previously report experimental data. The model was used to study the design and operation of a continuous ABE fermentation process (with and without recycle of biomass). For continuous operation, it was shown that multiple steady-states exist at low dilution rates. For operation with recycle of biomass, the influence of recycle rate on both biomass concentration and ABE productivity were studied. The results indicate that for a range of recycle and dilution rates, ABE productivity can increase to 16 g l−1 h−1 (10 times higher than that without biomass recycling), consistent with experimental results.",

Inspired by swinging arms facilitating multistep catalytic transformations in nature, polyelectrolytes-based artificial swinging arms were introduced to a multienzyme system by coaxial electrospinning technology. The poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), pre-dissolved in the core-phase solution, would penetrate across the shell of hollow nanofibers, thus act as artificial swinging arms and enable effective tethering and retention of the enzymes and cofactors on the outer surface of nanofibers via the ion-exchange interactions. With further intercalary insertion of another negatively charged polyelectrolyte poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS), a sandwich-like structure was formed on the outer surface of the hollow nanofiber. It was found that PSS layer not only effectively prevented the leaking of enzymes and cofactors, the double-polyelectrolytes also imposed crowding and confinement effects on the sandwiched multienzymes, thus the communication of the dehydrogenases and the shared cofactors were further facilitated. The methanol yield obtained with the sandwiched multienzymes system reached to 98.27%, which was 2.72-fold higher than that of the free system, and even 1.52-fold higher than that without PSS layer.",

In spiral reaction zone, a 45° cutting angle produced a tangential velocity strong enough to spin the granular sludge and maintain a moderate mixing intensity. A 30° installation angle produced a wide range of spiral flows. The 120° symmetrical arrangement of plates formed a strong–weak periodic spiral flow that strengthened material exchange. In separation zone, a value of 0.625 for the frustum characteristic parameter i (i = r1/r2, where r1 presented the bottom frustum radius of reverse cone, and r2 presented radius of spiral reaction zone of SSSABR) provided moderate recirculation.

The increasing market demand of enantiopure alcohols calls for exploration of more robust biocatalysts capable of delivering high conversion rates at high substrate concentrations. The carbonyl reductase YueD from Bacillus subtilis was engineered for improved reduction of halogenated acetophenones. Based on in silico docking and Alanine screening, mutant Val181Ala with 97% conversion of the model substrate 3-bromoacetophenone was obtained. Further molecular simulation analysis suggested expansion of the catalytic pocket and altered substrate orientation to provide a structural basis for the improved activity upon Val181 mutation. To eliminate the requirement of expensive exogenous NADPH and thus afford economical synthesis of enantiopure alcohol products, a cofactor regeneration system based on glucose dehydrogenase was introduced. Since the product of glucose oxidation seemed to inhibit the activity of YueD, xylose was used instead as the co-substrate, which efficiently regenerated NADPH in situ, delivering (S) or (R) alcohols with >99% ee at high conversion rates of 85–99% in the asymmetric reduction of halogenated acetophenones (500 mM).

Comparable decolorization results were observed with both types of bio-carriers indicating that the effect of bio-carrier type was negligible.

Simulations showed that flow pattern transited from a single circulation cell to multiple vortical cells with increase of the rotation speed and SGV. Increase in rotation speed had a more significant contribution to gas holdup, liquid velocity, bubble size distribution, flow pattern and shear rate than that of SGV. A stirred and aerated SBR was established to perform aerobic granulation with rotation speed at 300 rpm and SGV at 1.05 cm/s, and the average shear rate of the bioreactor was investigated. The experiment results showed that aerobic granules were successfully formed with filamentous bacteria entangling on the surface of granules. The filamentous granular sludge had good settleability with a settling velocity at 19.6 ± 5.1 m/h, and its SVI value was between 30 and 90 mL/g. The diameter of the granules was up to 1.42 mm.

Herein, we describe a mild and versatile method for the preparation of immobilized enzyme reactors by anchoring trypsin on polydopamine (PDA) functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) through DNA directed immobilization (DDI). This reactor exhibited prominent reusability and enhanced catalytic efficiency. The specificity constant (kcat/Km, where kcat is the catalytic rate constant) of the reactor was 1.82 s−1 μM−1, which was approximately 4.7-fold higher than free trypsin. Notably, the immobilized trypsin reactors maintained more than 55% of their initial activity after 70 cycles (in pH 9.0 PBS, 37 °C). The improved activity and reusability were dually benefited from the rigidity and stability of DNA linkers as well as the excellent biocompatibility and cushioning effects of PDA.

Heterologous production of (+)-nootkatone was achieved by co-expressing (+)-valencene synthase CnVS, codon-optimized (+)-nootkatone synthase opCYP706M1 and codon-optimized NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase opAtCPR1. The initial (+)-nootkatone production was 45.6 μg/L. Fusion of opCYP706M1 and opt46AtCPR1 (opAtCPR1 with 46 amino acids truncated at N-terminal) increased (+)-valencene conversion efficiency to (+)-nootkatone and (+)-nootkatone production increased to 312.2 μg/L, nearly six times higher than the initial. Overexpression of the MVA pathway rate limiting enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase tHMG1 and FPP synthase ERG20 improved the (+)-nootkatone production furtherly.

The aim was to assess the short-term response of the microbial communities to the different temperatures with respect to both hydrogen yield and composition of the active microbial community.

Lower hydrogen yields were obtained at the temperature range from 37 to 65 °C, likely due to consumption of the produced hydrogen by homoacetogenesis. No hydrogen production was detected at temperatures above 70 °C.

AmyE showed broad substrate specificity, and the main hydrolysis products from soluble starch were glucose, maltose, and maltotriose. Finally, the acid-denaturation mechanism of AmyE was probed using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The active site region (ASR) was identified, and was found to include the residues 221–323 which are strongly affected at pH 2.5, especially in the case of Asp313 located in the loop region. The conformational transition of the ASR was accelerated at pH 2.5. The conformational transition of the ASR not only disrupted the distances between the residue Asp313 and the residues Glu246 and Asp222, but also weakened the hydrogen bonds among the residues involved in the ASR, which eventually destroyed the enzyme’s catalytic activity. These MD results explain the molecular mechanism of acid denaturation of AmyE, which will greatly benefit the rational design of more acid-stable α-amylase variants, with potential applications in the baking and starch industries.",

Chapman-Richards model was used to describe yeast growth kinetics under varying pH and temperatures and the results were compared to Bergter and Andrew models. Alkaline-delignification of the wastes was done to solubilize lignin prior fermentation. This is because lignin is a complex organic plant compound that has been reported not to be degraded easily by many microorganisms. From the results temperatures 22–28 °C and pH 4.5–5.6 were noted as optimum for yeast growth on delignified waste bananas (DWB). Chapman model results were close to Bergter and Andrew models with very low RMSE. Delignification was noted to aid yeast growth with higher microbial populations (log10 cfu/g) registered with DWB samples as compared to non-delignified waste bananas (NDWB). Also, chemical characterization of the DWB and NDWB indicated higher proteins and lipids in the former than the latter by 3 and 4% respectively. This suggested the possible use of the upgraded wastes as chicken feed supplements. Higher minerals in DWB of 8.6% also suggested the possible use of the waste as a nutrient-rich fertilizer.",

The calculated results revealed that the van der Waals (vdW) interaction played an important role in determining the net attraction between the microalgae cell and the microsphere, while the Lewis acid-base (AB) interaction was always repulsion. Microalgae harvesting efficiency could be significantly improved by adding ferric chloride and lowering the pH value because the electrostatic (ES) interaction changed from repulsion to neutralization, and even to attraction, while the vdW and the AB interactions remained almost unchanged. The XDLVO analysis indicated that there was an effective attachment with a secondary minimum of −0.548 × 103 kT for S. obliquus-microsphere system and −0.744 × 103 kT for C. vulgaris-microsphere system.

Biochar had a positive influence in batch digestions, leading to a decrease in the lag phase and an increase in methane yields; this was even more evident for citrus peel wastes, which reached an increase of approximately 33% when 10 g L−1 of biochar was added and 56% when 30 g L−1 was added. Particle size analysis performed for the experiments shows greater surface area available in biochar systems for biomass immobilization.Analysis of the microbial communities by means of 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing shows that the biochar addition favoured the electro-active microorganisms consortia creating a synthrophic metabolism between eubacterial and archaeal populations, which resulted in an improvement of the anaerobic digestion performance.The codigestion of the mixture under a semicontinuous regimen showed an improvement in methane yields of approximately 60% and at hydraulic retention times of 30–20 days (reaching methane production values above 500 L CH4 kg VS−1 at an OLR of 1.49 kg VS m−3 d−1).

The suggested method includes disruption of cell to cell communication between bacterial communities in aerobic flocs in order to increase endogenous respiration. A quorum quenching (QQ) agent is applied in the aerobic tank in order to increase the free bacteria population, which leads to enhanced microbial predation and a decrease in extracellular polymeric substances. The sludge production yield (Yobs) of three pilots including a control sequencing batch reactor (SBR), a Cannibal system, and a QQ-Cannibal system was 0.5, 0.38, and 0.29, respectively.

In these case studies, we demonstrate that it is possible to use reaction profiles to determine, simultaneously, the relative specificities that the enzyme has for the different species in the reaction mixture and the probabilities of processive action occurring.

The rapid emergence of biosimilars is transforming cost competition in the biopharma industry, driving trends toward smaller, flexible single-use facilities and continuous biomanufacturing. As a result, there is a critical need to identify engineering strategies at both the process and cellular levels that can be applied to maximize the productivity of animal cell cultures used to manufacture protein therapeutics. Doing so will translate into lower drug production costs and shed light on the intermediary pathways that enable high protein expression. Identifying specific biochemical pathways that control the production rate and quality of recombinant proteins will enable a vertical advance in our ability to rationally engineer industrial host lines with high-productivity metabolic phenotypes.

It was found that a decrease in impeller speed to below NJS caused sampling difficulties, clumping and an increase to ∼2 NJS decreased the growth rate though an intermediate value of ∼1.3 NJS did not. Additionally, over this range of agitation intensities, cell quality remained unchanged post-harvest suggesting that poor growth performance at the highest speed was due to a failure of the cells to attach efficiently to microcarriers rather than damage to the cells due to fluid dynamic stress. Further it was shown that direct aeration of the culture medium both with and without Pluronic F68 via a sparger at NJS was detrimental to BM-hMSC growth. Again, this reduction in growth seems to be associated with poor attachment rather than cell damage, which due to the mechanism of PluronicTM F68 reducing the cell hydrophobicity and thus the affinity of the BM-hMSCs to attach to the microcarrier, leads to a poorer performance in the presence of the surfactant. Certain post-harvest quality characteristics are also detrimentally impacted compared to headspace aeration. This problem is discussed in terms of the need to facilitate future large-scale process development where headspace aeration at NJS may not be sufficient to meet culture needs at higher cell densities.",

     "abstract": "The rising demand for sustainable energy and the availability of abundant wastes have stimulated research efforts around the world. As a newly emerging energy-based technology, microbial fuel cell (MFC) has received a significant attention due to its broad range of applications. Therefore, understanding the topics of interest and broadening collaboration networks are necessary to advance the research development towards integrated efforts. In this bibliometric study, our aim was to evaluate the global research trends in MFC area based on publication outputs, co-authorships among authors and affiliated countries, and co-occurrences of author keywords. Using the Scopus database, a total of 4126 journal articles published between 1962–2017 were retrieved. Results have shown that since 2008, the number of publications increased by 100 articles every two years, resulting in the steady increase in the cumulative total publications until present. About 60% of the global total publications were contributed by researchers from China and USA, leading the other 70 countries/territories. Also, among the most productive university from each of the 15 leading countries, four were amongst the world’s top 100 universities. In conclusion, recent progress in MFC research includes the following (but not limited to) (i) electrode materials incorporated nanotechnology, ceramic, and biochar; (ii) mathematical modeling (e.g. artificial neural network); and (iii) economic assessment and life cycle analysis.",

In this work, thermally pretreated Scenedesmus obtusiusculus was evaluated as source of biomass for methane production, in systems operated under batch and semi-batch regime.

On the other hand, the system operated under semi-batch mode for 50 days attained a volumetric methane production rate of 1.15 L CH4/L-d with a methane yield of 177.9 mL CH4/g VSadded at an organic loading rate of 10 g tCOD/L-d and a reaction time of 12 h.

The present study demonstrated that irrE gene from Deinococcus radiodurans R1 promoted the furfural resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae through directed evolution. Compared to the wild-type strain, the FR mutant not only showed improved tolerance to single- or multi- inhibitors (furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, formic and acetic acid), but also obtained better ability of eliminating reactive oxygen species. Consequently, batch fermentation of the FR mutant in synthetic medium (200 g/L glucose and 2.0 g/L furfural) resulted in an 37% increase in ethanol productivity, although ethanol titer (∼88 g/L) was comparable to that of the control. This study provides the first evidence that an exogenous global regulator can improve the stress tolerance of yeast, which is significant for production of industrial products from lignocellulose by S. cerevisiae.",

Simple preparation procedures were carried out to minimize the use of hazardous chemicals and reduce the preparation costs. The biosorbent characterization results show that the prepared OPT biosorbents have nearly similar morphological structure, surface area, porosity, net surface charge and functional groups. The highest Au(III) biosorption capacity of 91.47 mg g−1 was observed for the OPT-D followed by OPT-T (75.30 mg g−1) and OPT-W (74.11 mg g−1). The Au(III) isotherm data fitted well with the Langmuir model, while the Au(III) kinetic data were well described by the pseudo-second order model. The mechanisms for the Au(III) biosorption were governed by diffusional and chemical interaction mechanisms in which the film diffusion was the rate-controlling step. The chemical interaction via electrostatic and reduction mechanisms between Au(III) and biosorbent surface active sites played a significant role for Au(III) biosorption in acidic condition. The OPT-D showed a good selectivity towards Au(III) from the coexisting ions in aqueous solution. The OPT-D also shows better reusability potential towards Au(III) which indicates the potential applications of OPT biosorbents as low-cost biosorbents for the recovery of Au(III). The Au(III) can be recovered from the burning residues of the Au(III) loaded OPT biosorbents.",

     "abstract": "Substrate limitation is a major concern in solid-state fermentation, especially for bacteria, as they are not capable of penetrating into the substrate particles. The use of a model substrate, such as agar spheres, makes it possible to study the intra-particle transfer phenomena in solid-state fermentation, reduce the system complexity, and determine the cell dry weight (CDW). A semi-mechanistic model was used to predict the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on agar spheres that contain starch as the only carbon source. The model was developed by introducing a new simultaneous substrate- and biomass-limited growth kinetic equation. The parameters of the growth kinetic were estimated by fitting the experimental data of both the CDW and cumulative CO2 production on agar spheres containing glucose. Statistical analysis (F-test) showed that the new growth kinetic equation was significantly better than the conventional substrate-limited growth kinetics. The model predictions were validated by the experimental data of growth, starch concentration and cumulative CO2 production (CCP) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa growing on agar spheres containing starch in aerated small packed-bed bioreactors. The model confirmed that at high initial starch concentration, free glucose and O2 were not the limiting factors, and bacterial growth is limited by other factors that are related to the amount of biomass in the biofilm.",

In this study, we have demonstrated, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the ability of bone marrow-derived hMSCs to migrate from one microcarrier to another, and, to populate fresh microcarriers when added into suspension culture. Additionally, we have shown that compared to inoculating a culture with cells in free suspension, inoculating 10% of near-confluent microcarriers from an initial seed microcarrier culture resulted in an increase in the cell growth rate and overall cell yield and a significant reduction in the lag phase. These findings were consistent across cells from three different BM-hMSC donors and across different culture medium conditions, foetal bovine serum-supplemented medium, human platelet lysate-supplemented medium and serum-free medium. This new cells-on-beads inoculation method is an effective means of process intensification with the potential to decrease manufacturing times and potentially costs of hMSC-based therapies.",

This paper presents an integrated experimental and cost analysis of different cell culture technologies for umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cell expansion: a multi-layer vessel (ML), a stirred tank bioreactor with microcarrriers (STR), a hollow fiber bioreactor (HF) and a packed-bed bioreactor (PB). The results showed that the cell proliferation rate, expansion fold and harvesting efficiency were highest in HF (36.8 ± 1.7 h; 9.8 ± 1.0 −fold; 100%). The STR, ML and PB achieved a similar level of cell number with high expansion folds (8.8 ± 0.39, 8.7 ± 0.90, 6.9 ± 1.3 −fold, respectively). However, harvesting efficiency was lowest with PB (18% ± 0.77), followed by STR (61% ± 15.7). The cells retained their functional properties post culture in all the technologies evaluated. The experimental results were incorporated into an advanced decisional tool comprising a bioprocess economics model and a stochastic model so as to evaluate the commercial economic feasibility and robustness of different candidate technologies for MSC manufacture. The model predicted that HF would be the least cost-effective option despite its advantageous experimental performance, due to its high consumable and equipment costs. ML ranked first in cost-effectiveness and robustness in this scenario followed by STR. The results also demonstrated how the bioprocess economics model can be used to direct improvements to the culture platforms so as to achieve commercial success according to the reimbursement level.",

The potential of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as a modeling technique has been evidenced by simulating the biohydrogen production by photo-fermentation using an immobilized consortium of photo-bacteria. The ANN model was constructed with a set of indoor experimental fermentations operated on batch at 30 °C and under different conditions of light intensity, initial pH and metals concentrations (Fe, V and Mo) added to the medium. After that, the model was cross-validated on indoor photo-fermentations as well. Different ANN architectures were evaluated to develop the best data-based model. The chosen architecture can render the maximum correlation between the real bio-hydrogen production and the outputs provided by the ANN model. Experimental kinetics were contrasted with the modeled kinetics, evidencing the reliability of the model for predicting the biohydrogen production by supplying sampling times, and initial operating conditions such as metals concentration, light intensity and pH as input data. The ANN-based model was successfully validated on an outdoor fermentation, where light intensity changed along the process time, which demonstrated its veracity and generalization capacity.",

It considered uncertainties in the initial conditions, on-line measurements, and model parameters by performing Monte Carlo simulations within the monitoring system. It predicted, therefore, the probability distributions of the unmeasured states, such as biomass, lactose, and lactic acid concentrations. To this end, a mechanistic model was developed first, and a statistical parameter estimation was performed in order to assess parameter sensitivities and uncertainties. The model coupled a biokinetic and a mixed weak acid/base model to predict biological variables and chemical variables like the pH, respectively. In the soft sensor, the limited available on-line measurements, namely the quantity of added ammonia and pH, were used to update the model parameters that were then used as input to the mechanistic model. The soft sensor predicted both the current state variables, as well as the future course of the fermentation, e.g. with a relative mean error of the biomass concentration of 8%. This successful implementation of a process analytical technology monitoring system opens up further opportunities, including for on-line risk-based monitoring and control applications.",

For this purpose, switchgrass was first subjected to alkaline pretreatment, which reduces its recalcitrance and increases enzyme accessibility. Both simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) and separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) were applied. The pretreated switchgrass solids inhibit ABE fermentation, presumably due to the residual lignin portion, as evidenced by the toxicity test of various model phenolic compounds. Addition of a non-ionic surfactant, Tween 80, alleviated the phenol-induced inhibition. As constrained by the “solid effects”, the upper limit of solid loading that SSF could process was in the range of 5–6%. SSF with 5% solid loading produced a total of 12.3 g/L ABE solvents with 7.8 g/L of butanol. SHF was further applied to process higher solid loadings. A total of 14.3 g/L ABE solvent with 8.5 g/L of butanol was produced from SHF with 7% solid loading.

The microalgae can utilize monosaccharides (glucose, fructose and galactose) as carbon sources for mixotrophic growth in ADSW when they cannot use maltose, sucrose or starch. Compared to the blank ADSW culture, the addition of 0.8% monosaccharides improved the algal concentration by more than 2.2–2.5 times during laboratory axenic culture. Moreover, the cellular lipid content in the biomass increased by 50.5–93.4%. The fatty acids analysis indicated that more than 44–51% of the lipids were covered with saturated fatty acids (C14:0, C15:0, C16:0 and C18:0) in the presence of 0.8% monosaccharides, whereas only 28% were covered in pure ADSW culture. Up-scaling the culture outdoors showed that the addition of sugar caused severe bacterial contamination in the algal system. Fortunately, the rapid growth of bacteria did not collapse the algal system. Similar to the results of the laboratory culture, both the algal growth and lipid accumulation were enhanced with addition of the three monosaccharides during outdoor culture. This result suggests that adding the three monosaccharides to ADSW is a potentially effective way to enhance both the biomass and lipid production.",

Network structures of the hydrogel microspheres are readily controlled by simple addition of inert porogen, which induces phase separation during the polymerization. Fluorescent labeling studies reveal tunable distribution of the chitosan within the PEG networks (i.e., uniform and core-shell like distributions) depending on the content of the porogen in the prepolymer solution. In addition, protein conjugation studies show tunable pore sizes and 3D network structures by adjusting content of the porogen, and formation of macroporous networks leading to significantly improved protein conjugation kinetics. The macroporous network structures are further supported with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results that correspond well with confocal microscopy results.

As a result, a mixture of the extractant trioctylamine and the diluent isopropyl myristate was chosen and reactive extraction was successfully integrated into the cultivation of A. terreus via solvent addition after 63 h. Thereby, the pH of the culture broth was increased and inhibition by undissociated itaconic acid was reduced. As a consequence, glucose consumption and product formation were considerably improved. In combination with an enhanced amount of glucose, either supplied initially or during the cultivation, this increased the total itaconic acid concentration from 70 to 105 g L-1 referred to the absolute amount of itaconic acid divided by the volume of the aqueous culture broth. Simultaneously, volumetric productivity increased from 0.72 to 0.91 g L-1 h-1. With reactive extraction, therefore, a highly promising method for in situ removal of itaconic acid could be established.",

Biosensors are one emerging technology aiming to improve the existing time-consuming and expensive monitoring approach. Surface functionalisation is a key aspect of biosensor development and here we propose that lectins offer an excellent alternative to antibodies offering a higher capture efficiency for oocysts. We also demonstrate that lectin immobilisation using a protocol of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid followed by EDC-sulfo-NHS results in superior performance, compared to three other common surface functionalisation protocols, achieving an 86% capture efficiency. We also determine that capture efficiency with lectin surfaces is enhanced by the use of static conditions, in contrast to previous work with antibodies where surface capture was improved by convective conditions. These results will be highly useful in guiding the development of new biosensor systems for protozoan pathogen detection.",

Because of the combination of electrochemical and biological denitrification processes in series, electrochemical inhibition of microorganisms was eliminated, and sufficient hydrogen was supplied safely. The efficiency of HEAD-PBR was evaluated using synthetic groundwater (containing 50 and 25 mg N/L of NO3−) at different hydraulic retention times. A high nitrate removal efficiency (∼99%) was achieved, the electrolysis, heterotrophic denitrification, and autotrophic denitrification were responsible for 15.6%–23.4%, 44.6%–68.4% and 15.7%–31.7% of nitrate removal, respectively. This effective material conversion can be attributed to microbial ecological interactions such as sufficient utilization of sawdust and proper consumption of hydrogen, oxygen, and ammonia. The HEAD-PBR was found to be an efficient reactor system with high treatment capacity, but without accumulation of byproduct in effluent. Thus, HEAD-PBR is a promising reactor configuration for nitrate removal and implementation of HAD technology.",

Both experimental and simulation results showed high NOB (nitrite oxidizing bacteria) presence in the small granules under conditions in which the NOB could be outcompeted in the large granules. The presence of NOB in the small granules reduced the nitrite accumulation. The simulation results indicated that NOB was preferentially presented in granules small than 50 μm.

In this study B. braunii was grown in flat panel photobioreactor under varying light intensity.

Finally, simulation of RTE in flat panel photobioreactor also suggests, at cell concentration (>0.41 g L−1) multiple scattering and diffusive reflections reduced the light penetration.

However, traditional open microalgae mass cultivation systems that use sunlight are typically no more than 30 cm deep due to light attenuation and self-shading by the mircroalgae and, therefore, have low CO2 uptake efficiency due to their shallow depth. To address this issue, a non-energy consuming light guide was employed to diffuse light deep into a top-lit, 120 cm deep open gas-lift cultivation system. This gas-lift system has been already shown to increase areal biomass productivity by 60%. Without any increase in supplied light energy, the light guide enhanced light penetration into the bioreactor and resulted in further increases in biomass and lipid productivities per unit area of 33% and 16%, respectively. The factors influencing light and CO2 absorption rates were investigated with a Plackett-Burman experimental design. Mathematical models for predicting biomass and lipid production as well as optimal bioreactor configurations for maximizing lipid production and minimizing production costs were then determined by applying response surface methodology. The optimum configuration of operational parameters identified by the optimization function was then verified in the gas-lift bioreactor equipped with the light guide and resulted in areal biomass productivity of 34.4 gdw/m2day and areal lipid production of 223.9 gLipid/m2.",

This enhanced uptake was preferentially stored in the cells rather than being used for growth, indicating the activation of a luxury uptake phenomenon. The intracellular P storage in N. salina was measured and the presence of polyphosphate granules was detected. The kinetic of accumulation and consumption of internal phosphorus was quantified in batch cultures, as a function of P concentration and light intensity.

In this study the developed anaerobic digestion model takes the substrate lignin concentration as well as the concentration of such phenolic compounds into account. The biomethane production and hydrolysis rate of seven different substrates was described and simulated. A good agreement between simulations and measurements was obtained, as the maximum Theil’s inequality coefficient for the different substrates was 0.14. The impact of higher concentrations of the phenolic compounds, up to 2000 mg/l, was simulated for two of the substrates namely, hemp straw and miscanthus. As significant inhibition only occurred for the anaerobic digestion of miscanthus, a global sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation (assessing all the processes in the model) was done for this substrate. The global sensitivity analysis showed the great importance of the hydrolysis rate and the need to research factors, i.e. inhibitors and substrate types, influencing this hydrolysis step.",

The inactivation efficiency of two-stage MBCO2 on S. pastorianus increased with lowering the initial buffer pH, although the pHin of S. pastorianus in pH 3 buffer was decreased by heating to 45 °C, regardless of the use of MBCO2. Conversely, the number of surviving S. pastorianus cells in pH 4 and 5 buffers was decreased by the two-stage MBCO2 without the pHin-lowering. Furthermore, the inactivation efficiency of two-stage MBCO2 on S. pastorianus increased with increasing pressure in the mixing vessel, although the pHin-lowering was caused by heating to 45 °C for all of the pressures tested, regardless of the use of MBCO2. Therefore, intracellular acidification of S. pastorianus by two-stage MBCO2 was due to the cell penetration of extracellular H+ associated with the temperature increase, and the inactivation was suggested to be induced by the combined factors of increasing temperature, pHin- and pHex-lowering and high dissolved CO2 concentration.",

It has previously been shown that efficiency of erythroblast culture in scalable bioreactors is not primarily limited by mass transfer, availability of medium components, or commonly recognised inhibitory metabolites or cytokines. We have developed a dynamic mechanistic model that describes an autocrine feedback loop in which a cell-derived factor accumulates in culture medium resulting in reversible erythroblast growth inhibition. Cells exhibited two phases of growth: a relatively uninhibited followed by an inhibited phase. Cell cycle analysis during inhibition identified slight accumulation of cells in S phase, distinct from the G1 accumulation anticipated in growth factor or nutrient deprivation. Substantial donor to donor growth rate variability (mean 0.047 h−1, standard deviation 0.008 h−1) required the growth rate parameter to be refitted for different donors. The model could then be used to predict growth behaviour with full medium exchange, but showed some reduced predictive ability after partial medium exchange. The model could predict the growth inflexion point over a range of phenotypic maturities from early to late maturity erythroblasts; however the secondary phase of growth differed substantially with less inhibition observed in more mature cells. The model provided a framework to optimise culture economics based on cost of production time and input consumables. It also provided a framework to evaluate the benefits of biological process engineering in medium design or cell modification vs. operational optimisation depending on the specific cost scenario of a process developer.",

Currently, there is no standard protocol for predicting agitation rate to maintain aggregate size when moving from one reactor to the next. This study evaluates the use of seven different scale-up parameters commonly used to predict agitation rate in scale-up. For experimental testing, murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were grown as aggregates in 10-mL and 100-mL stirred suspension bioreactors. We showed that depending on which criteria was used for scale-up, the corresponding agitation rates differ greatly, causing significant differences in the cell growth. We determined that if the volume average energy dissipation rate (calculated through CFD modeling) or maximum shear stress were kept constant, aggregate sizes could be maintained through scale-up. Using these methods, we can scale-up stem cell growth efficiently without extensive testing of bioreactor agitation rates.",

Till the current times, researchers have been able to design numerous types of nanoscale fluorescent tool kits for monitoring protein–protein interactions through real time cellular imagery in a fluorescence microscope. It is apparent that supplementing any protein of interest with a fluorescence habit traces its function and regulation within a cell. Our review therefore highlights the application of several fluorescent probes such as molecular organic dyes, quantum dots (QD) and fluorescent proteins (FPs) to determine activity state, expression and localization of proteins in live and fixed cells. The focus is on Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) based nanosensors that have been developed by researchers to visualize and monitor protein dynamics and quantify metabolites of diverse nature. FRET based toolkits permit the resolution of ambiguities that arise due to the rotation of sensor molecules and flexibility of the probe. Achievements of live cell imaging and efficient spatiotemporal resolution however have been possible only with the advent of fluorescence microscopic technology, equipped with precisely sensitive automated softwares.",

     "abstract": "Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are widely used for the manufacture of therapeutic mAbs with high productivity processes generating 5–10 g/L mAb. High productivity processes impose considerable strain on the intracellular metabolic and redox homeostasis resulting in increased oxidative stress. We investigated the mechanisms by which oxidative stress affects the productivity of a mAb producing CHO cell line by controlling bioreactors at dissolved oxygen (DO) set-points ranging from 20 to 175% of air saturation. The results showed that for the 20–75% DO conditions, despite similar growth and viability, there were significant differences in productivity, consumptions of oxygen and amino acids, intracellular redox, and mitochondrial function. Our results demonstrate that as the external dissolved oxygen increased, intracellular H2O2 increased, mitochondrial function diminished, flux into one-carbon metabolism pathway decreased, and cells diverted metabolic activity from mAb production. Intriguingly, although the reductase activities were similar irrespective of the DO concentration, the intracellular reduced-to-oxidized glutathione ratios were low for all conditions, which demonstrated that the intracellular antioxidant mechanisms had difficulties managing oxidative stress. Combined, these results indicate that mAb production may be limited by the cell’s capacity to manage oxidative stress and thus provide a new attribute to leverage during upstream process development.",

To determine whether the relative positioning of immobilized βG to MNP surfaces impacts enzyme activity, MNPs were conjugated with βG using a glutaraldehyde cross-linker for proximal binding with different polyethylene glycol spacer-linkers (MW: 200, 400, 1000). MNP surface modifications were validated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the measurement of saturation magnetization for the bioconjugates revealed minor decreases in magnetic moments relative to core MNPs. All four bioconjugates showed similar binding efficiencies for βG, but measured increases in Km values and decreases in Vmax values, regardless of the spacer length, indicated that the specific activity of βG was lowered upon enzyme immobilization and spacer lengths were negligible. Despite a reduction in βG activity, immobilization conferred thermal stability under conditions in which the native enzyme is inactivated. To evaluate the recycling properties of the bioconjugates, enzyme activity measurements were conducted for ten consecutive rounds at 45 °C. The bioconjugates hydrolyzed total amounts of p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucoside comparable to a single application of unmodified βG following the third recycling round along with significant activity after ten rounds. Based on these results, the enhanced stability of immobilized βG on recoverable MNPs provides a means for reducing the amount of βG required for cellulose hydrolysis, thereby reducing costs associated with ethanol production.",

Regarding the BLIS synthesis, the highest concentration of sucrose (2.0%) and the lowest vinasse level (1.0%) reduced the production of BLIS identified by the decrease in antimicrobial activity (mean inhibition zone of 10.7 mm). Conversely, the lowest sucrose concentration and highest vinasse level exerted the strongest inhibition, with a mean inhibition zone of 12.2 mm against Staphylococcus aureus CECT-239.",

Due to variable and complex composition of real DFW, system performance and behaviour was compared with synthetic wastewater (SWW) in two identical pilot-scale UBR-A systems. Both systems were operated for 334 days first under internal recycle ratios (R) of 2, 3 and 4 and then at solids retention times (SRT) of 140–150, 65–75 and 30–40 days at uniform R of 3. Performance with both wastewaters was comparable with higher nitrification efficiencies ( > 90%) and COD removal (>80%) under all conditions, and lower denitrification efficiencies at R > 3. DFW exhibited significantly lower nitrification/denitrification rates, biomass yield, VSS/TSS ratio and a higher inert COD fraction showing that kinetics, sludge characteristics and organic matter degradation were not analogous. The optimum internal recycle ratio was found as R of 3 at a total hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 4 days whereas at different SRTs, performance efficiencies were mostly comparable however nitrification and denitrification rates significantly increased at lower SRT of 30–40 days.",

However, the problem of high internal resistance (Rint), which results in low power density, is a technical obstacle related to this process, and the preferential conversion of the organic fraction by bioelectrogenesis remains unclear. This study involved designing a novel three-chamber bioelectrochemically assisted anaerobic composting process (AnCBE,III) to dispose of dewatered sludge (DS), which was operated at reduced internal resistance. The maximum power density of the AnCBE,III was higher (7.0–8.6 W/m3) than that of the two-chambered AnCBE,II (4.7–5.7 W/m3), with lower Rint (63.8–88.5 Ω) than that of the AnCBE,II (78.8–98.5 Ω). At the end of composting, the AnCBE,III had higher total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) removal (42.3 ± 0.5%) than the AnCBE,II (32.1 ± 0.5%). During electrogenesis, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) [hydrophilic fraction and hydrophobic acid fraction of EBOM] (extracellular biological organic matter) was substantially removed, the hydrophobic neutral fraction of aromatic macromolecules was increasingly solubilized (by 13.2%), and the aromatic protein-like and humic acid-like substances were substantially removed. The results demonstrate that the increases in both the proton exchange area and cathode surface area in the AnCBE,III can enhance electricity generation and organic matter degradation.",

The proton conductivity of CS separator was comparable to Nafion 117; however, the oxygen mass transfer coefficient of CS separator was lower than Nafion 117, indicating it as superior separator. These separators were used in MCC with Chlorella sorokiniana grown in cathodic chamber. The maximum power density (MPD) and coulombic efficiency (CE) of MCC with CS separator were 3.2 W/m3 and 16.53%, respectively, whereas the MCC with Nafion 117 membrane showed a MPD of 1.8 W/m3 and CE of 8.42%. Although the COD removal efficiency in the anodic chamber of Nafion-MCC (72.14 ± 0.15%) was superior to CS-MCC (65.97 ± 0.83%), the algal specific growth rate at cathode was found better in CS-MCC (2.64 day−1) than Nafion-MCC (2.16 day−1).

Ala234 of D-LDH from S. laevolacticus was found to be an important amino acid residue that positively affects catalytic activity. Site-saturation mutagenesis of the 234th residue was performed. The mutant D-LDH at the 234th residue from alanine to serine or glycine showed enhanced catalytic activity toward pyruvate. The kinetic analysis revealed that the kcat/Km of D-LDH_A234S and _A234G on pyruvate increased 1.9- and 1.2-fold, respectively. Furthermore, the double mutant D-LDH_T75L/A234S improved kcat/Km by 6.8-fold compared to that of wild-type D-LDH.

     "abstract": "Dynamic mechanistic modelling of cell culture is a key tool in bioprocess development to support optimisation and risk assessment. However, the approach is underutilised in the bioprocess industry due to challenges including lack of accessible tools to support a structured approach, the difficulty of realising computationally tractable (low parameter) yet realistic models, and the specialised skill sets required. We have proposed that these issues could be partly addressed by developing a parsimonious framework comprising a set of model building blocks, based on the ordinary differential equation modelling paradigm, representing common cell culture dynamics and modulation thereof. The framework is designed to avoid obvious pathological behaviours. Further, specific model instances within the framework can be simply visualised as a directed graph with vertices representing system species, dynamics and modulations, and arcs representing the interactions between them. The directed graph can be extended to describe the timing and nature of experimental interventions. A visual and intuitive route to describing models with an associated mathematical framework enables realisation in a software interface and integration with standard mathematical tools such as those for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation. Such a framework is sufficient to represent some of the simple mechanisms underpinning bioprocesses that nonetheless lead to highly non-linear and counterintuitive outcomes. It also has a relatively low learning burden for users without formal mathematical training. The concept could be extended to include, for example, partial differential equation-based approaches to stochastic or spatially complex systems built up from a small number of parametrically parsimonious and well-behaved building blocks.",

Flexible incubation capacity can be provided by external incubators if cultures can be safely transported to and from the isolator for processing. We tested a transportable conditioned cell culture chamber (TC4) designed for this purpose. We previously published on good cell growth using this processing system to expand K562. In this study, we performed mock production runs with a highly permissive color-changing bacterial broth. We took samples of the final mock cell product and incubated them for bacterial growth. We also performed environmental monitoring of the cell processing chamber with an air sampler and contact plates. Positive control samples were all yellow and turbid. Negative samples and all test materials were negative for microbial growth.

In this approach, patient’s T cells are isolated, modified, expanded, and administered back to the patient. Modifications may include adding specific T cell receptors (TCR) or chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) to the isolated cells by using retroviral vectors. PG13 cells, derivatives of NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts, are being used to stably produce retroviral vectors that transduce the T cells. PG13 cells are anchorage-dependent cells that grow in roller bottles or cell factories and lately also in fixed bed bioreactors to produce the needed viral vector. To scale up viral vector production, PG13 cells were propagated on microcarriers in a stirred tank bioreactor utilizing an alternating tangential flow perfusion system. Microcarriers are 10 μm–0.5 mm beads that support the attachment of cells and are suspended in the bioreactor that provides controlled growth conditions. As a result, growth parameters, such as dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, and nutrients are monitored and continuously controlled. There were no detrimental effects on the specific viral vector titer or on the efficacy of the vector in transducing the T cells of several patients. Viral vector titer increased throughout the 11 days perfusion period, a total of 4.8 × 1011 transducing units (TU) were obtained with an average titer of 4.4 × 107 TU/mL and average specific productivity of 10.3 (TU) per cell, suggesting that this method can be an efficient way to produce large quantities of active vector suitable for clinical use.",

Glutaraldehyde-activated particles showed higher laccase activity after immobilization and higher relative detection currents for 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (2,6-DMP). The multi-shelled structural morphology of Fe2O3 yolk-shell particles significantly improved the biosensing properties of immobilized laccase compared to that of spherical pure Fe2O3 and composite SrFe12O19 and Y3Fe5O12 particles. The prepared biosensors showed high selectivity towards 2,6-DMP, with a sensitivity of 452 μA/mM/cm2. Under optimum conditions, the linear ranges of detection were as follows: 2,6-DMP (0.025–750 μM), guaiacol (0.10–250 μM), pyrogallol (0.25–250 μM), and 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (1.0–125 μM), with limit of detection values of 0.010, 0.052, 0.093, and 0.273 μM, respectively.

A correction factor (CF) was added to the “Anaerobic Digestion Model number 1” (ADM1) using the Modified Model Aiba Kinetic model (MMAK-CF), allowing to improve the model agreement. Different initial concentrations of substrate were used to study their effect on hydrogen production and bacterial growth. The results show that the cumulative produced hydrogen increases with increasing the substrate concentration to reach a maximum. An optimal value was calculated at the initial substrate concentration of 0.022 mol L−1. Bacterial growth followed the same trend.

While pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) sensors for shake flasks exist since a couple of years, the cell density is still an essential process variable which is challenging to monitor on-line in shake flasks due to the moving liquid wave. Here we characterize the factors which affect the measured signal of an optical sensor based on backscattered light detection. Influences of controllable factors like rotation speed, filling volume, angular coverage of the full rotation by the measurements, flask size and temperature on the measurement performance were investigated for non-baffled and baffled flasks using a turbidity standard solution. For the straightforward calculation of the cell density, a general formula was derived, describing the effects of these factors on the measurement and their interactions. Finally, this formula was applied to a biological model system and a standard operation procedure was developed for the online measurement of the cell density in real cultivations. Through this strategy, maximum measurement resolution and stability are achieved while the labor for setup is simultaneously reduced.",

The results verified that these fluctuation HRT strategies could enhance microbial diversity, while robust against fluctuations in nutrient load of the denitrifying granular sludge. Microbial aggregates appeared in RC, RUF and RDF on days 22, 12 and 7, respectively. The sludge in RUF and RDF achieved complete granulation on days 22 and 14, respectively. Compared to the results of RC and RUF, the acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) concentration rapidly increased, and changed the components of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) resulted in the rapid formation of denitrifying granular sludge in RDF. These results demonstrate that microbial community, AHLs, EPS, and the denitrifying sludge granulation process were associated with each other. Informed from quorum sensing system, a mechanism for the granulation of denitrifying sludge using the DF-HRT strategy was proposed.

Protein adsorption behaviors were investigated using bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme (LZM) as model proteins. The modification led to the net positive charge decrease to approximately zero (A320-C270), and then reversed the net charge to negative till the maximum negatively charge resin A20-C970. Adsorption capacity for BSA decreased from 205 ± 5 mg/mL (FF-PEI-L740) to 65 ± 3 mg/mL (A320-C270), but increased, for LZM, from 31 ± 1 mg/mL (A320-C270) to 281 ± 13 mg/mL (A20-C970) with increasing net negative charge. The uptake rate of BSA or LZM decreased with decreasing net positive charge or increasing net negative charge due to the decreased flexibility of the PEI chains brought from the increased electrostatic attraction or repulsion and/or tight binding due to the high net charge density. Effect of ionic strength (IS) showed that the resins with high net charge densities exhibited high adsorption capacities at high IS. Besides, dynamic binding capacity values achieved as high as 55 mg/mL for BSA and 143 mg/mL for LZM. Chromatographic experiments demonstrated favorable elution of bound proteins at NaCl lower than 370 mmol/L.",

     "abstract": "A new excess phosphate uptaking in an anoxic-aerobic sequencing batch reactor (SBR) using starch as sole carbon source that was different from the traditional biological phosphorus removal in anaerobic-aerobic alternation condition was confirmed and reported previously. To reveal its mechanism and biochemical pathway of metabolism, this study was conducted. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique was applied to trace the carbon metabolism in the SBR applied by supplying 13C label starch. Results show that the phosphorus removal reached 80% without any P release during the whole process. The sludge had a very lower accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) but a higher accumulation of glycogen. The metabolic pathway of glycogn synthesis and phosphorus removal was proposed that during the anoxic phase, the starch was hydrolyzed and then converted to lactic acid by lactic acid producing organism (LPO). Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was generated from the lactic acid formation, and used for polyphosphate (poly-P) synthesis. In the meantime, lactic acid was used to synthesize glycogen by phosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs). In the aerobic stage, PAOs oxidized glycogen to release energy for cell growth and its maintenance, as well as phosphate uptake and poly-P synthesis. The LPO performed the majority of the P removal in the SBR during the anoxic stage. This study improves our understanding to how phosphorus removed in the anoxic-aerobic system.",

For this purpose, MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts were seeded on chitosan-hydroxyapatite scaffolds under different flow rates and directions. We showed that static seeding with a five-day preculture ensured higher mitochondrial activity during perfusion culture. Bidirectional perfusion culture at 0.1 and 0.5 mL/min were applied for 21 days after static seeding and 5 days of static preculture to evaluate the effects of flow rate on the viability, morphology and osteogenic differentiation of cells. We found out that 0.1 mL/min flow rate significantly increased the mitochondrial activity of the cells, whereas osteogenic differentiation could be enhanced by 0.5 mL/min flow rate. In the last part of the study, in combination with static culturing bidirectional perfusion at 0.1 mL/min was applied for cell seeding and culturing.

To this end, bench-scale bioreactors receiving ammonium-rich wastewater were adapted to progressively reduced temperature after 370-day operation (Period I), and subsequently acclimatized to raw leachate for 86 days (Period II). Maximum nitrogen removal rates (NRR) of 218.9, 211.9, 201.1 and 146.9 g N m−3 d−1 were achieved at 30 °C, 20 °C, 15 °C and 10 °C respectively during Period I, mainly ascribing to partial nitritation/ANAMMOX. Furthermore, the SNAD bioreactor turned out to be feasible for prolonged treatment of mature landfill leachate under 15 °C (Period II), with simultaneous degradation of nitrogen (207.9 g N m−3 d−1) and bio-refractory organics (94.9 g COD m−3 d−1) respectively. High-throughput sequencing implied that better denitrogenation performance during Period II might be ascribed to reappearance of denitrifying bacteria (9.88%) and complete suppression of nitrite oxidation bacteria (NOB), although ammonium oxidation bacteria (AOB) and ANAMMOX bacteria (AMX) decreased by 6.05% and 4.56% respectively. Furthermore, the enriched bio-refractory organics degradation bacteria (24.38%) were conductive to the performance robustness.

Of the various polymers, zwitterionic polymers have been found to work as protein stabilizers. Inspired by the literature outcomes, we have herein developed a novel nanoparticle-based carrier modified by grafting a highly hydrophilic zwitterionic polymer, poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) (pCBMA), on silica nanoparticles (SNPs), which was denoted as SNPs-pCBMA. For comparison, an uncharged polymer, poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (pGMA), was also grafted onto SNPs to prepare SNPs-pGMA. The two types of polymer-grafted SNPs were extensively characterized and used for the covalent bonding of two enzymes, catalase and lipase (pGMA-CAT, pCBMA-CRL, pGMA-CRL and pCBMA-CRL). The results revealed that both the immobilized enzymes on SNPs-pCBMA exhibited higher thermal and storage stabilities than those on SNPs-pGMA, due to protective effects of the zwitterionic polymer. For example, by incubation at 50 °C for 20 min, the residual activities of pCBMA-CAT and pCBMA-CRL kept 60.5% and 60.3% of their initial activities, respectively, higher than those of pGMA-CAT and pGMA-CRL (55.6% and 48.3%, respectively). The immobilized enzymes on SNPs-pCBMA also exhibited higher stability under neutral and alkaline conditions and good reusability. Taken together, the research proved that pCBMA-grafted materials were promising support for enzyme immobilizations.",

Results revealed a high proportion of protein materials in the Colloids fraction, while HPO and TPI fractions were mostly constituted of humic-like materials.

The highest interactions were observed between inoculum age and beef extract, followed by substrate to moisture ratio and PEG 8000. The statistical model provided optimal enzyme production conditions as: 5 g wheat bran; mineral salt solution (pH 5) and containing (g/L); NH4Cl (0.5), beef extract (2.0) and PEG 8000 (3.0) substrate to moisture ratio of 1:3.5 and 30% (v/w) 18 h old inoculum.

Polyglucuronic acid is a major component of the algal cell wall. This study focused on applying the two enzymes to a common bloom-forming, toxin-producing algae, Microcystis aeruginosa. We hypothesized the 2 enzymes would kill algae through disrupting the cell wall, with H208F displaying a higher killing efficacy over WT. A fluorescence assay in conjunction with live/dead staining was used to quantify killing of algae treated with each enzyme. SEM analysis was used to observe cell wall morphology in order to verify the killing mechanism. The mutant H208F was confirmed as having potential application as a biochemical, enzymatic algaecide with a 17% greater algicidal efficacy than the WT.

To assess the feasibility of using this enzyme to oxidize aqueous phenols at low concentrations, a five-parameter kinetic model was developed based on previous work to predict the transient kinetics of reactions catalyzed by laccase from Trametes versicolor. The model was calibrated against data collected at pH 5.0 and 25 °C for batch reactions of triclosan, cumylphenol, and estradiol. Phenol data arising from an earlier study was used for comparison. The kinetic model, which incorporated a term for enzyme inactivation, accurately simulated the time course of reactions of all four compounds for ranges of substrate and laccase concentrations that spanned up to 5 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the model made accurate predictions far outside of the range of its calibration. The utility of the model for assessing the feasibility of using laccase to catalyze the oxidation of substrates over a range of reactant concentrations was demonstrated. Modelling and experimental results showed that estradiol, cumylphenol and triclosan can be oxidized through the catalytic action of laccase at aqueous substrate concentrations in the micromolar to nanomolar concentration range, while using substantially less enzyme than required for phenol.",

Accordingly, the use of flocculants was studied here as an alternative to traditional processes for the clarification of CHO cell cultures producing two model glycoproteins: erythropoietin (EPO) and a monoclonal antibody (MAb), selected for their distinctive glycosylation profiles. Ten polymers, including poly-l-amino acids, polyacrylamide co-polymers and polyamines, were evaluated at concentrations between 60 and 100 ppm at different harvest times. The sedimentation rate, clarification efficiency, and DNA and host cell protein (HCP) removal were evaluated. Poly-l-amino acids were the most effective for removing cells, HCP, and DNA. Whereas increasing harvest time decreased cell removal efficiency for most flocculants, it increased HCP and DNA removal. Polyethylenimine was among the best flocculants tested. Its effect on the glycosylation profile of recovered glycoproteins was determined. No effect on the quality (glycosylation profile and charge variant distribution) and interaction with flocculant of the MAb was observed. In contrast, polyethylenimine affected EPO glycosylation, as it removed highly sialylated glycoforms, reducing product quality. These results illustrate cases where flocculation can be successfully used as initial clarification step for recovery of glycoproteins without affecting their glycosylation.

By PPy modification, the corrosion resistance and the power generation performance of the anode can be significantly improved. The maximum power density of MFCs with PPy/SS anode reached a value of 1190.94 mW m−2, which was about 29 times higher than that with bare SS anode. In addition, the results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic-voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterizations showed that the MFC with PPy/SS anode had lower internal resistance and higher capacitance than that with bare SS anode. These ensured the PPy/SS improved corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, power density and made it a promising anode material for MFCs.",

To provide a more rational reasoning behind scale-up of mammalian cell cultures, physical characterization of bioreactors with working volumes of 15 mL, 3 L, 270 L, 5′000 L and 15′000 L was carried out using a combination of computational and experimental methods. Maximum hydrodynamic stress, mixing time and oxygen mass transfer coefficients were experimentally determined for all bioreactor scales. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations based on Reynolds-averaged Navier‐Stokes equation coupled with bubble size population balance equations were used to determine local as well as average hydrodynamic stresses and mass transfer coefficients. Furthermore, mixing times were determined by simulated tracer experiments. All calculations are well in agreement with experimentally measured values, thereby providing a validation of the CFD simulations. This integrated experimental and modeling methodology represents a valuable tool for a Quality-by-Design approach enabling the transfer of mammalian cell cultures in-between reactor scales, even for geometrically different reactors. Additionally, this study provides a rational framework to transfer an operating space developed at small scale to larger scales.",

In this study, a new set of performance indices were defined to quantify the state and potential of cells suspended in a cryopreservation solution, i.e., the survival ratio of cells suspended in cryopreservation solution was provided for the cell state estimation, and the recovery ratio of cells after freezing and thawing, the attachment efficiency of cells after seeding, and the specific growth rate of surviving cells were provided for the cell potential estimation. Using these indices, the time-dependencies of cell viability variation in human induced pluripotent (hiPSCs) and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) suspended in a cryopreservation solution were investigated.

For this study, the biomass, resveratrol and sugar concentrations as well as pH and dissolved oxygen were monitored daily. The experiments were conducted twice over a three month period. The culture was elicited during the exponential growth phase with methyl jasmonate, leading the cells to exhibit a complex behaviour during the resveratrol production phase. A model of the system behaviour involving simple mechanisms is proposed and successfully confronted to the experimental results. This model demonstrates that the system dynamic can be decomposed into four phases: a lag phase (cell growth slowing down), a starting phase (beginning of resveratrol production), a surge phase (significant resveratrol production accompanied by significant cell death) and a stationary phase.

High-throughput method based on microtiter filter plate was used to determine adsorption properties and optimize separation conditions. For resins with anion-exchange groups alkaline condition would be favorable for HSA adsorption, while acidic condition for resins with cation-exchange groups.

Cultivation of the extreme halophilic archaeon Haloferax mediterranei showed suitability of the BCR for continuous halophilic processes. To reduce cost and ecological impact of this process a highly saline industrial waste stream from a chemical production process was used as source for NaCl.

The highest Reynolds differences (3400 < Re < 5400) and low liquid velocity differences between the aqueous and oil phase (0.02–0.05 m s−1) were obtained in the riser at assayed superficial gas velocity (Ug). The hexadecane (HXD) specific mass transfer area was increased due to the presence of a greater HXD volume, which enhanced the volumetric hexadecane gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient (kLaHXD) compared to other works at φ < 0.1. Thus, high HXD transfer rates were obtained through a 14-day batch culture. Conversely, the high φ value promoted a volumetric oxygen gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient (kLaO2) enhancement. The oxygen transfer rates were improved because of an increase in the oxygen saturation concentration. The maximum uptake rates obtained were 3.44–7.74 g HXD L−1 h−1. The increase in Ug with a high φ value, led to a positive effect that improved the mass transfer of HXD and oxygen, allowing high HXD uptake rates.",

     "abstract": "Production of the optically pure enantiomers has attracted much attention for both agrochemicals and drugs due to their more target-specific feature and fewer side effects than racemic mixtures. In the case of ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug, the (S)-(+)-form is remarkably active than (R)-(−)-enantiomer. Lipolytic enzymes were considered as excellent biocatalysts for enantiomeric resolution of ibuprofen. In this study, the gene encoding a thermo-halophile putative esterase/lipase/thioesterase, briefly named ELT, from Rhodothermus marinus DSM 4252 was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Reusability of the enzyme was provided by the immobilization onto biocompatible supports of SiO2 and chitosan coated Fe3O4-nanoparticles (CS-MNPs). Immobilized enzymes were recovered from the reaction mixture and employed to catalyze at least ten reactions with a residual activity above 80%. The storage stability increased from 45% for the free enzyme to 75 and 92% for ELT-SiO2 and ELT-MNPs, respectively, after 14 days incubation at 25 °C. Kinetic studies showed that the ELT-SiO2 had higher substrate affinity and turnover number in comparison to the free enzyme. ELT-SiO2 and ELT-MNPs showed enantioselective potential towards hydrolysis of ibuprofen ethyl ester with the conversion percent of 44 and 42% and the product enantiomeric excess of 40 and 43, respectively. The present reusable biocatalyst can be considered to obtain enantiopure ibuprofen with invaluable impact in pharmaceutical industry.",

In this paper, we investigate the growth rate of an aerobic microbial ecosystem by two series of experiments performed in continuous agitated cultures. Using a constant dilution rate, but different input substrate concentrations in each experiment, the biomass and substrate concentration were measured at steady state to confront their values with those obtained theoretically from the well-known mathematical model of the chemostat using either resource or density-dependent kinetics. The structures of both flocs and microbial communities were monitored in order to interpret the results. The experiments confirm that density-dependent growth-rate can result either from a high concentration of biomass or from the structuration of this biomass into flocs and we have shown that a new parametrized family of growth functions, that we proposed in this paper, suits better the experimental data than Monod or Contois growth functions.",

     "abstract": "White rot fungi possess a powerful ability to degrade recalcitrant lignin within plant biomass. Pycnoporus cinnabarinus PB 94 accomplishes lignin degradation through the combined activity of laccases, peroxidases, and their supporting enzymes. Assembly of the de novo transcriptome for PB 94 resulted in identification of 45,286 transcripts, including isoforms, and a predicted 27,990 genes. Differential expression analysis revealed how the expression of these ligninolytic enzymes was dictated by the nature of the substrate. Growth on lignin containing poplar and switchgrass resulted in as much as a 285-fold increase in expression of peroxidases (auxiliary activity family AA2) and a 36-fold increase in expression of alcohol oxidases (auxiliary activity family AA3) compared to growth on soluble sugars. These findings suggest that expression of these enzyme classes was controlled by the presence of lignin, or triggered by an aromatic break out product of lignin degradation. Laccases showed little significant regulation under these growth conditions, but one laccase transcript (TR10024|c0_g1_i1), similar to laccase gene lcc2 in Pycnoporus sanguineus, was greatly upregulated during growth on cellobiose, suggesting that this sugar may be a mechanism for enhanced expression.

Adsorption isotherms and effects of pH, dissolved humic acid (DHA) and Cu2+ on norfloxacin (NOR) sorption to biochar and MT-BC composite were carried out. Montmorillonite modified biochar showed higher adsorption affinity for NOR. The qmax value increased from 10.58 mg g−1 to 25.53 mg g−1 after surface modified by montmorillonite. MT-BC composite had rich pore structure, with specific surface area (SSA) and pore volume values of 112.6 m2 g−1 and 0.604 cm3 g−1, respectively. The optimum pH range for NOR adsorption on MT-BC composite is 5–11. The presence of DHA (20–150 mg L−1) greatly suppressed the NOR adsorption. The decrease of NOR sorption is attributed to the “competitive adsorption” of DHA with NOR and “pore blockage” by sorbed DHA. Similarly, reduced NOR sorption with Cu2+ was probably due to the competition for sorption sites on biochar surface. Compared to DHA, Cu2+ resulted to a smaller decrease in NOR sorption. This is because the formation of NOR-Cu2+ complexes can slightly increase NOR sorption capacity. The dominant adsorption mechanisms of NOR on MT-BC composite are electrostatic interaction, H-bond and pore-filling. This study provided valuable guidance and effective method for the removal of NOR from aquatic environments.",

This study introduces a two-chamber single-use bioreactor that is capable of cell culture expansion from 1 to 50 L. The prototype is a proof of concept that can help users save costs of purchase and qualification of equipment, reduce factory footprint, and reduce the risk of contamination during culture transfer from one intermediate bag to another. The prototype is made of two chambers of different volumes, interconnected as a single, closed system. The design and construction of the prototype is described in detail and results from the engineering characterization (e.g., mixing time, power input per unit volume, and oxygen mass transfer coefficient) are reported for both chambers. The results are in good agreement with general criteria proposed in literature for bioreactor design and with published data for commercially available bioreactors. Further, the concept is not limited to the two-chamber design presented in this study; additional chambers can be integrated along with different volumes, geometries, mixing, sparging, and heating approaches.",

     "abstract": "Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) has emerged as a powerful approach to recombinant protein biosynthesis for applications in biochemical engineering and synthetic biology. To date, CFPS systems have been most commonly derived from a variety of organism sources including microbes (e.g., Escherichia coli and yeast), plants (e.g., wheat germ and tobacco), and eukaryotic cells (e.g., rabbit reticulocytes and Chinese Hamster Ovary cells), each with their own advantages and opportunities. To expand the palette of CFPS platforms, we recently established a Streptomyces lividans-based cell-free system for the expression, especially, of high GC-content genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of natural products. Unfortunately, batch protein expression yields were limited to ∼50 μg/mL of a model enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Here, we sought to address this limitation and improve protein biosynthesis yields. By increasing the total extract protein concentration in the CFPS reaction, which increases the concentration of catalyst proteins available for protein biosynthesis and energy regeneration, and modifying our extract preparation procedure, we enhanced batch protein biosynthesis yields of EGFP more than 2-fold, to 116.9 ± 8.2 μg/mL. Then, we demonstrated that our simple and robust approach could be applied to six other Streptomyces strains. Looking forward, we expect that our more highly productive and efficient Streptomyces CFPS systems can be used to synthesize, study, and discover natural product biosynthesis pathways in vitro.",

At the laboratory scale, the evaluation of membrane separation performance often involves a ‘stirred cell device’; however, this simple tool is poorly suited for conducting high-throughput studies of separation performance. Here, we designed a high-throughput stirred cell (HTSC) device which is ideally suited for conducting optimization studies, especially at the early stages of bioprocess development when small volumes of feed material are available. The HTSC allows for up to six filtration experiments to be run simultaneously with continuous mixing above each membrane facilitated by suspended magnetic stir elements. Using fluorescently-labeled dextrans as model biomolecules and commercial ultrafiltration membranes, it was shown that the HTSC device gave the same separation performance as a traditional stirred cell, but with the added benefits of operating at a faster pace (due to its parallel nature) and requiring nearly an order of magnitude lower sample volumes. Furthermore, the utility of the HTSC was demonstrated by concurrently evaluating the performance of four different ultrafiltration membranes for the same model biomolecule and the membrane selectivity for a mixture of two model bio-macromolecules.",

The interaction between suspended algal cells and the radiation field within the culture has been modeled.The impact of the light distribution within the cultures on the growth rate rx, as well as on the amount of chlorophylls per unit biomass and on the efficiency of usage of photons, has been assessed. The effects of the alternative use of red and blue light were analyzed in previous studies [17], [41].

     "abstract": "An acid-tolerant tyrosinase, tyrosinase-CNK, was used to form chitosan/gelatin hydrogels without any additional crosslinking materials at pH 4, where appropriate chitosan/gelatin blends were efficiently prepared based on the solubility of chitosan only under acidic conditions. The in vitro gelation degree and rheological studies revealed that the gelation of the chitosan/gelatin solution was successfully achieved within 12 min by the tyrosinase-CNK reaction at pH 4, and the glycol chitosan/gelatin blends were similarly crosslinked within 7 min at pH 6 (the optimum pH of tyrosinase-CNK). Remarkably, tyrosinase-CNK catalyzed the formation of permanent and stable chitosan/gelatin and glycol chitosan/gelatin gels, unlike the previous results of tyrosinase-mediated chitosan/gelatin gelation in which commercially available mushroom tyrosinase only catalyzed transient gel formation. In addition, the pore size distribution was greater than 100 μm in the morphological structure, and the high swelling ratio and enhanced mechanical properties are expected to be suitable for tissue engineering applications. These results demonstrate that the acid-tolerant tyrosinase-CNK can efficiently mediate the in vitro formation of chitosan/gelatin conjugates, and the obtained hydrogels have the potential to be used as a promising scaffold.",

The ANRE process was demonstrated to be high-efficient with the substrate (ammonium and nitrite) removal efficiency up to 97% and the effluent ammonium concentration less than 1 mg N/L. Kinetic analysis indicated that the maximum specific ammonium utilization rate was 46.40 mg N/(g VSS·d) and the half-saturation constants ks was 0.25 mg N/L. The ANAMMOX granular sludge was observed to disaggregate gradually due to the consumption of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS).

An improved strain of Clostridium autoethanogenum, an acetogenic bacteria, was developed by LanzaTech and shows high potential in production of ethanol and 2,3-butanediol from industry waste gas (mainly CO/CO2) via gas fermentation. In this study, a spatiotemporal metabolic model was formulated and evaluated using steady-state CO fermentation data collected from a laboratory-scale bubble column reactor. The spatiotemporal model was comprised of a genome-scale reconstruction of Clostridium autoethanogenum metabolism and multiphase convection-dispersion equations that govern transport of CO, secreted byproducts and biomass. The model provided good agreement with measured ethanol, acetate and biomass concentrations obtained at a single gas flow rate. Then to obtain satisfactory steady-state predictions at three gas flow rates, the upper bound of the proton exchange flux in the genome-scale reconstruction was correlated with the gas flow rate as an indirect means to account for the effects of acetate secretion on extracellular pH. We believe the modeling method established by this work has strong potential to facilitate commercial-scale design of gas fermentation processes for production of biofuel and biochemicals.",

Meanwhile, highly advantageous mutant K47E selected from a random mutagenesis library displayed 1.8-fold increase in activity, and half-life increased by 2.0-fold at 50 °C (T50). The additive effect of these two advantageous mutants K47E/V132F showed 2.2-fold increase in activity than PEL168.

The K47D/V132F/R272W specific activity reached to 5610 U/mg at 1 mM Ca2+, showing highest activity of reported alkaline pectate lyases, with T50 extended to 330 min. Structure comparisons revealed that a much open catalytic clef and increased structure compactness of K47D/V132F/R272W were the main contributors for increased specific activity and stability, respectively.

The CFD models established for the OSR600 were validated by visual comparison of the liquid flow pattern in an experimentally agitated OSR600. In the model, both shear stress and energy dissipation rate (Φ) were calculated to evaluate the hydrodynamic stress environment for cell cultivation. The highest values of shear stress and Φ were localized along the lower part of the conical vessel wall. The effect of filling volume and shaking speed on kLa, Φ and shear stress were also analyzed. An increase of the percentage of the liquid affected by higher shear stress and Φ was observed at filling volumes of 300 mL and 400 mL compared to lower filling volumes. This may be due to the twisted curvature at the base of the liquid wave under these conditions. In conclusion, the CFD model provided a means to characterize the fluid dynamics of the OSR600 under various operating conditions to help identify those most suitable for cell cultivation.",

Furthermore, we proposed that the binding free energy and binding conformation had significant effect on enzyme enantioselectivity simultaneously, and played pivotal role in Km and kcat, respectively. A well-studied, important lipase LipK107, and both positive and negative mutants were explored to validate our finding. Compared with WT, the mutations indeed resulted in the alteration of both binding energy and conformation, which collectively led to the changes of enzyme enantioselectivity. Our work indicated that rational enzyme engineer should attach great importance on both the binding free energy and the binding conformation of substrate and enzyme.

The effects of light-related strategies (including light intensity, photoperiod and light-switching strategies) on lipid production were investigated. It was found that the light requirements for biomass or lipid accumulation varied greatly at different growth stages, probably due to increasing biofilm thickness. By switching the light intensity from 700 to 1134 μmol m−2 s−1 at day 3 in Strategy I, a maximum biofilm/lipid production of 241.67/53.62 g m−2 was achieved at day 8.

SpA-SFP@SiO2 showed a higher performance than commercially obtained SpA-Agarose particles and no loss of matrices. Moreover, in IP assays, SpA-SFP@SiO2 showed an approximately 300% higher precipitation of target protein than the commercial SpA-Agarose product when a small amount of cell lysate was used.

     "abstract": "The fundamental mechanism behind biosorption to recover carbon from wastewater through high-rate activated sludge (HRAS) system is insufficiently studied. The most accepted method of quantifying biosorption capacity of activated sludge depends on higher settling velocity solids. As HRAS had different settling characteristics and in addition, raw wastewater fed to the HRAS system contained approximately 55% settleable organics, the conventional biosorption capacity test was not capable of accurately defining biosorption. Thus, we studied ex-situ aerobic yield as an alternative approach for determination of biosorption in batch systems. However this approach similarly to biosorption capacity was not sensitive enough to quantify differences between HRAS types, potentially due to enhanced storage mechanisms under the feast-famine approach. A viable method to determine biosorption in the batch system was based on measurement of ex-situ oxygen uptake rate (OUR) of HRAS over 40 h and the biosorption yield was considered as the area underneath the OUR curve normalized for solids concentration. In addition, in-situ based biosorption quantification was proposed in this study based on detailed measurement of carbon mass balances including contribution of extracellular polymeric substances. A clear relationship between biosorption yield and in-situ biosorption with carbon mass-balance, carbon redirection and solids retention time of HRAS systems was observed suggesting two viable methods for quantification of biosorption.",

The highest hydrogen productivity (129.0 molH2 m−3 d−1) and yield (5.4 molH2 kgCOD−1) with complete inhibition of methanogenisis were achieved when the reactor was fed with 75% cheese whey and 25% glycerin with an applied volumetric organic load of 23.9 kgCOD m−3 d−1; an increase in productivity of almost 145% and 27% when compared to the anaerobic digestion of cheese whey and glycerin separately, respectively, showing the significant benefit of glycerin addition for anaerobic whey digestion, most likely due to its buffering capacity. A kinetic metabolic model was efficiently fitted to the process to help understand the metabolic routes. Cloning analyses targeting 16S rRNA genes indicated the dominant microorganisms were phylogenetic affiliated to Ethanoligenens and Megasphaera genera.",

Focus of this study was on development of eco-friendly process for the production of flavonoid acetates. By using phloridzin as model compound and triacetin as acetyl donor and solvent, 100% conversion and high productivity (23.32 g l−1 day−1) were accomplished. Complete conversions of two other glycosylated flavonoids, naringin and esculin, in solvent-free system were achieved, as well. Comprehensive kinetic mechanism based on two consecutive mono-substrate reactions was established where first one represents formation of flavonoid monoacetate and within second reaction diacetate is being produced from monoacetate. Both steps were regarded as reversible Michaelis-Menten reactions without inhibition. Apparent kinetic parameters for two consecutive reactions (Vm constants for substrates and products and Km constants for forward and reverse reactions) were estimated for three examined acetyl acceptors and excellent fitting of experimental data (R2 > 0.97) was achieved. Obtained results showed that derived kinetic model could be applicable for solvent-free esterifications of different flavonoid glycosides. It was valid for entire transesterification course (72 h of reaction) which, combined with complete conversions and green character of synthesis, represents firm basis for further process development.",

A major approach for simple and efficient immobilization is introduction of an affinity tag to the target enzyme. Thus, in this study, the recombinant ω-TA with His-tag was successfully expressed in E.coli Rosetta (DE3). To realize the one pot purification and immobilization of ω-TA, Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid functionalized magnetic mesoporous silica nanoflowers (Ni-NTA/MMS-NF) were synthesized for the first time. The morphology, structure, and composition of the Ni-NTA/MMS-NF were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, etc. The immobilized ω-TA had the same optimum temperature with free ω-TA, and the optimum pH of the immobilized ω-TA was shifted from 7.5 to 7.0. Compared to free ω-TA, the immobilized ω-TA showed increased thermal stability, better pH stability, and excellent storage stability. Additionally, the immobilized ω-TA preserved 67.38% of initial activity after reusing twelve times. These results revealed that Ni-NTA/MMS-NF might have great potential in the purification and immobilization of His-tagged enzyme.",

Similar growth rates to the control were observed for PG at 0.2 loading. For MEA, algal growth was accelerated at 0.5 loading but was inhibited at 0.2 loading. This was related to the volatile MEA crossing the membrane and poisoning the algae. Considering the kinetics of CO2 absorption into the solvent, the improvement of microalgal growth and the system stability in case of solvent leakage, amino acids such as PG are the ideal solvent for this application.",

This method, which allows multiple simultaneous replicates from a single low-volume biomass sample, can improve and simplify the model calibration exercise by providing more and better experimental data. To follow up on the interest in microrespirometry, two model wastewater treatment processes were set up and used for model calibration: an aerobic degradation of 4-chlorophenol by acclimated sludge, and a synthetic wastewater treatment by activated sludge, which were well described by a Haldane model and a modified ASM3 model, respectively. For each process, the model parameters were estimated by model fitting, minimizing the objective function for each replicate independently, and minimizing the objective function for all replicates simultaneously (multiresponse approach). Parameter confidence intervals were determined for all parameter estimates, and the impacts of measurement errors, number of replicates, and parameter correlation were assessed. It was observed that the multiresponse approach presents several advantages, including single-step parameter estimation, independent of the number of replicates, and determination of confidence intervals that include the main sources of uncertainty.

A direct peptide–bacteria binding assay for identification of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-derived peptides binding to a probiotic bacterium, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, was performed using an octameric-peptide library spot-synthesized on a cellulose membrane. Twenty-three peptides enhanced bacterial binding (>4-fold increase as compared to no-peptide control). High-density adhesion of L. rhamnosus was observed with 15 peptides synthesized on a glass surface, and six peptides also maintained adhesion at mild acidic condition of pH 5.5. Remarkably, one of the identified peptides, QRCVNLQA, induced aggregation of lactic acid bacteria and promoted bacteria–mucosa interaction. When the QRCVNLQA peptide was co-incubated with L. rhamnosus, it contributed to cellular aggregation and enhanced in vitro adherence to Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells, leading to slight enhancement of MUC2 expression in Caco-2 cells.

The results showed that a higher upflow velocity could lead to a smaller dead space in the CDC reactor, and thus a higher processing efficiency could be achieved. The tanks-in-series (TIS) model was proved to be more adaptive to simulate the flow characteristics of the CDC reactor than the axial dispersion (AD) model under the present experimental conditions.

Although cell growth was promoted by increasing the amount of oxygen supplied, increasing the overall volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient rather decreased the specific BGL activity of yeast cells probably because of the high agitation speed used. To suppress the formation of ethanol, the method of feeding glucose was investigated. Namely, the timely addition of glucose and glucose feed rate were found crucial for increasing both cell concentration and specific BGL activity. When the lowest concentration of dissolved oxygen at 9 h was used as an indicator, the lowest glucose feed rate of 1 g/(L·h) provided the maximum BGL activity of 673.6 U/g-dry cell, which is 1.6-fold higher than that in batch cultivation. By employing the fed-batch technique together with the improved gene cassette containing the SED1 promoter and anchoring domain, we found that the cell concentration and specific BGL activity continued to increase, reaching 15.4 g-dry cell/L and 1866.6 U/g-dry cell after 48 h, respectively.

The resulting branched poly(SPM)-grafted cation exchangers exhibit typical ionic exchange characteristics for lysozyme adsorption and the maximum adsorption capacity reach 450 mg/mL on Sep-BrS-S12B2 whereas γ-globulin adsorption is more dependent on polymer architecture.

Experimental evidences show that the performance of polymer-grafted cation exchanger can be improved by regulating polymer architecture. The calorimetric results further indicate that counter-ions are released from polymer and proteins during protein adsorption. With an increase of the adsorption density, adsorbed proteins experience a change of molecular orientation along poly(SPM) chain.

The enhancement in GOS production is achieved by continuous accumulation of GOS with less degradation as the hydrolysis activity of the mutants is strongly suppressed. The mutant F414S is found to be the most promising engineered glucosidase. Compared to the wild-type (WT), the hydrolytic activity of the mutant F414S deducts by up to 350-fold and the molecular catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for hydrolysis deducts by 22-fold, whereas the production of GOS increases from 138.58 (WT) to 207.63 mM (F414S) by 50%. Most of the mutants result in alteration of catalytic specificity, yielding both galactooligotetrasaccharide (GOS4) and galactooligotrisaccharide (GOS3) compared to the sole product GOS3 by the WT. The molecular docking study presents a plausible explanation for reaction specificity alteration and hydrolysis inhibition for most of the mutants.",

Semi-dilute conditions (1.5–2 times higher than critical concentrations) were considered in order to generate non-Newtonian rheological behaviors and to avoid neglecting particle–particle interactions in opposition to dilute conditions. Observed phenomena as well as hydrolysis mechanisms including solvation, separation, fragmentation, and solubilization appeared to depend strongly on initial substrate properties. For both FP and SCB, suspension viscosities were correlated with particle size distributions and volume fractions during hydrolysis, but they exhibited strongly different trends. With SCB, a viscosity overtaking was clearly observed at enzyme loading ≤10 FPU/g cellulose. This phenomenon is explained by the separation of agglomerates into individual fragments, leading to an increase in the total number of particles and a morphological shift of particles from sphere-like into fiber-like. With FP, the viscosity collapsed at the initial stage in relation to the volume reduction of coarse particles and the number increase of fine particles. Suspension viscosity was strongly dependent on the fraction of coarse population and nearly independent from the glucose conversion yield.",

Typically, SLs are produced using different hydrophobic substrates, such as alkanes, vegetable oils, and industrial effluents. The properties of the SLs are highly dependent on the hydrophobic substrate used for their production. The aim of the present study is to investigate the properties of SLs produced using three new hydrophobic substrates: Tapis oil, Melita oil, and Ratawi oil. The structures of the SLs were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The SLs yields using Tapis, Melita, and Ratawi oil were 26, 21, and 19 g L−1, respectively. The SLs produced using Tapis, Melita, and Ratawi oil reduced the surface tension of pure water to 36.38, 37.84, and 38.92 mN/m, respectively, corresponding to critical micelle concentrations (CMCs) of 54.39, 55.68, and 58.34 mg L−1. These values are comparable with SLs produced using palm oil (surface tension 35.38 mN/m and CMC 48.76 mg L−1). The SLs produced using Tapis oil show a maximum emulsification activity of 71.2%. The produced SLs are active over the pH range 2–10 and for salinity up to 20% (w/v) NaCl. Thus, they show potential for various applications, including microbial enhanced oil recovery and oil spill remediation.",

EPS extract was characterized based on protein and polysaccharide composition, excitation-emission matrix (EEM) and molecular weight (MW) profile. Four methods were applied to extract EPS from activated sludge: combination of formaldehyde and sodium hydroxide, combination of sodium hydroxide and heating, cation exchange resin (CER) for tightly-bound EPS, and sonication for loosely-bound EPS. Extraction methods affected not only extraction efficiency but also composition of proteins and polysaccharides, EEM spectra and MW profile of extracted EPS. Combination of formaldehyde and alkaline is preferable to acquire high extraction efficiency with less cell lysis. Upon EEM analysis, the CER method was appropriate to detect a wide range of fluorescent organic substances, while alkaline extraction was less efficient for detection of humic acid-like substances. Alkaline extraction is more appropriate for extraction of large EPS molecules with a variety of MWs. However, it should be noted that changes in MW distribution may occur during alkaline extraction.

This study aims at gaining an insight into convective diffusion to enhance mass transfer within small (0.5–1 mm), medium (1.5–2 mm) and large (3–3.5 mm) granules. The convective diffusion rates (FCD) of granules at a superficial liquid velocity of 3 m/h were 2–3 magnitudes greater than molecular diffusion rates (FMD), and significantly enhanced the biogas production rate of small, medium and large granules by 4, 1.5 and 1.3 folds.

The large granules possess best mass transfer condition and highest biogas production rate because they had highest FCD due to the biggest permeable area despite lowest η. This work for the first time elaborates the important roles of internal structures in terms of permeability and fractal dimension on the convective mass transfer in anaerobic granules, and it also highlights the importance of molecular diffusion.

Carbonic anhydrase (EC 4.2.1.1) is an enzyme that catalyzes CO2 hydration with high turnover numbers. This work is aimed at developing CA-based biocatalysts applying the technique of magnetic Cross-Linked Enzyme Aggregates (CLEAs) to bovine carbonic anhydrase (bCA) and magnetic nanoparticles (NPs). The CLEAs were obtained by crosslinking the precipitated bCA/NPs aggregates with glutaraldehyde. Optimum conditions for the immobilization procedure were assessed in terms of type of precipitating agent, concentration of glutaraldehyde, crosslinking operating conditions, and concentration of magnetic NPs. The optimization was carried out with respect to the maximum immobilization yield and to the CLEA activity. The maximum immobilization yield was 84% and the maximum activity (1268 WAU/mgCLEA) was measured for CLEAs prepared with 100 mM glutaraldehyde at 4 °C, after 16 h crosslinking and 0.5 gNPs/gbCA. Morphological analysis of CLEAs prepared under different conditions was carried out by optical microscopy. Vigorous stirring during the precipitation step provided reduction of aggregates size that was slightly modified by magnetic field separation. Moreover, the morphological analysis shows evidence of some detrimental effects of high NPs concentration on CLEAs activity.",

Flat sheet membranes were fabricated via thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) method and characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), contact angle, energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), tensile test and pure water flux. The filtration experiments and FESEM confirmed that certain dosages of SiO2 NPs (0.5 wt.%) can increase the membrane porosity. Fouling analysis revealed that the presence of SiO2 NPs in the membrane matrix results in respectively 27% and more than 70% reduction in the total fouling ratio (TFR) and irreversible fouling ratio (IFR) and a little bit increase (16%) in the reversible fouling ratio (RFR). The obtained results showed high efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rates like more than 95% for both membranes coupled biological filtration tests. In order to identify the most likely fouling mechanism, Hermia’s model was used and the obtained results revealed the existence of two fouling phases; in the first phase, cake filtration is the main fouling mechanism for both membranes, while complete blockage model is the prevailing fouling mechanism in the second phase.",

The Chi-squared function was used for the error estimation and the R-squared index (R2) was used for the regression analysis. The results imply that the model can elucidate the interactions of nitrogen converting bacteria in a biofilm system for various feeding characteristics.

For validation, model simulations were performed under three varying scenarios and R2 was more than 0.9 so that all forecasted values lied within the 95% confidence interval. In addition, the estimated physiologic characterization of two dominant anammox species was discussed upon calibration and validation of the model. The maximum specific bacterial growth rates (μmax) for Candidatus Brocadia anammoxidans and Ca. Scalindua sp. were estimated at 0.0025 h−1 and 0.0048 h−1 respectively. Decay rate of Ca.

This reaction is appealing because it represents a double gain: (1) reduction of CO2 and (2) an alternative to fossil fuel based production of CH3OH. The present review evaluates the efficiency of different immobilized enzyme systems and reaction designs that have been explored for optimizing this sequential enzymatic conversion of CO2 to CH3OH, including multilayer microcapsules, bead scaffolds, cationic nanofibers, and membrane systems. The recent progress within efficient cofactor regeneration, protein engineering of the enzymes for robustness, and advanced uses of membrane systems for enzyme reuse and product separation are assessed for large scale implementation of this biocatalytic reaction cascade. Industrial realization of enzymatic CO2 to CH3OH conversion including the option for reaping of formaldehyde and formate during the reaction warrants innovative development. There is a particular need for development of i) better enzymes; ii) improved understanding of enzyme structure function aspects of reverse catalysis by dehydrogenases, iii) quantitative kinetic models of the enzymatic cascade reaction during simultaneous cofactor regeneration, iv) robust systems for regeneration of reducing equivalents.",

So, we have designed a practical and efficient synergetic polymer pair system (SPPS), which can regulate and preserve the enzymatic activity of cellulase with a pair of oppositely charged polymers. First, we designed and synthesized a copolymer, poly(ethylene- glycol)-graft-poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PEG-g-PDMAEMA) with hydrophilic and cationic chains, which was connected with anionic cellulase to form a water-soluble cellulase/PEG-g-PDMAEMA complex to inhibit the enzymatic activity of cellulase completely without loss of secondary structure. In the second step, the enzymatic activity of enzyme/copolymer complex was recovered successfully with the addition of an anionic polymer, poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc). What surprised us was that 81% of the enzymatic activity of the cellulase/PEG-g-PDMAEMA complex was restored after 10 min of heating at 90 °C. Circular dichroism (CD) spectral analysis clearly indicated that there was no significant impact on the conformation of the cellulase of heat-treated enzyme/copolymer complex.",

Hence, in this study, an advanced modeling and optimization technique was applied to optimize medium parameters for enhanced ε-polylysine production by marine bacterium Bacillus licheniformis. The critical nutrients including glucose, yeast extract, magnesium sulphate and ferrous sulphate were incorporated in artificial neural networks (ANN) as input variables and ε-polylysine as the output variable.

Strains and phages were periodically isolated from each co-culture replicate until the phage extinction. In the spot testing, isolates showed an antagonistic coevolution with cumulative development of phage resistance and infectivity against the host strain. The center of infection (COI) assays quantitatively revealed that coevolution entailed a gradual reduction of interaction between hosts and phages. The COI value of the isolates from 38th batch was less than 1% of that of the wild-type pair, and this value was still sufficient for their sustained coexistence. Adsorption assays and single-step growth experiments revealed that coevolution involved the changes in both adsorption rate and phage productivity. A fitness cost of phage resistance was observed as a reduction of the specific growth rate. However, it tended to recover during the long-term coevolution.",

FT-IR and NMR analysis confirmed that the chitosan ester was formed and the lipase selectively catalyzed the acylation of the 6-OH groups of chitosan without protection of its −NH2 groups. The effects of several key reaction factors were investigated and the maximal degree of substitution (DS) value of 0.214 was obtained under the optimum conditions. The X-ray diffraction analysis showed that morphological and crystallographic properties of native chitosan were largely destroyed after modification.

Spherical MBs were fabricated via ionotropic gelation followed by rapid-sintering (1200 °C/5 min), featuring reasonably high open porosity (∼50%), appropriate specific surface area (30 ± 5 m2/g) and multi-modal pore sizes (d50 = 79 nm) for envisaged enzyme immobilizations. After activation and amino-silanization, GOx and CAT were successfully immobilized onto MBs applying an EDC/sulfo-NHS crosslinking reaction. Under varied pH and temperature conditions, the immobilized enzymes showed advantages towards harsh conditions (pH 2; 70 °C) and demonstrated high activities at neutral pH and 21 ± 2 °C (RT), serving as optimal conditions for flow experiments. By varying flow rates (0.1–6 ml/min) in individual reactor compartments, GOx- and CAT-functionalized MBs achieved satisfiable H2O2 conversion rates at 1.0 ml/min for 24 h.

Experiments with nutrient limiting conditions showed that N-limited and P-supplemented conditions were necessary to stimulate phenol uptake if the initial concentration of phenol is <1 mg/L or is between 2.5–5.8 mg/L. Further studies revealed that instead of manipulating nutrients, enforcing the C-limited condition on the microorganisms through a two-staged reactor process, not only did the phenol removal efficiency improve but also eliminated the need to externally manipulate N and P concentrations in the system. The high abundance of hydrocarbon degrading gram-negative bacteria and Pseudomonas species in the second stage of the two-staged process, further confirmed that C-limitation was a better option than the nutrient manipulation. The study thus illustrates methods of acclimatizing microorganisms to remove very low concentration of target substrate (here phenol) in low strength wastewater.",

Three cation exchangers of different ionic capacities (ICs, 140–240 mmol/L) were synthesized, and the alginate-based resins, denoted as Alg-FFs, were studied for lysozyme (Lys) adsorption and chromatography. It was found that the adsorption capacity and effective protein diffusivity of Lys increased with increasing alginate-grafting density or the IC value. The resin with the highest IC value (240 mmol/L), Alg-FF-240, was compared with a commercial cation exchanger, CM Sepharose FF. It revealed that both protein adsorption capacity and uptake rate of Alg-FF-240 were remarkably higher than CM Sepharose FF at NaCl concentrations lower than 100 mmol/L, so the dynamic binding capacity (DBC) of Alg-FF-240 was much higher than CM Sepharose FF at the salt concentration range. Moreover, the DBC of Alg-FF-240 maintained high level at the flow rate up to 1350 cm/h, and at the highest flow rate studied, the DBC of Alg-FF-240 for Lys was about 1.7 times higher than that on CM Sepharose FF. Salt-gradient elution revealed similar protein elution behaviors on the Alg-FF-240 and CM Sepharose FF columns.

To minimize the limitation of enzyme deactivation encountered in these reaction cascades, an organic-single-phase continuous stirred tank reactor (ospCSTR) process was developed. Considering the numerous degrees of freedom of this continuous multistep reaction which due to enzyme deactivation additionally has no steady-state, the process development is a challenging task. Therefore, the influence of operating parameters on the efficiency was studied in detail. Due to the avoidance of harsh conditions, at optimized parameters α-pinene oxide was produced selectively (95%), and with high space-time yields (880 gPO L−1 d−1). The catalytic productivity (118 gPO g−1CalB) was significantly higher than previously reported. To counterbalance the reduced but still present deactivation, the opsCSTR was enhanced with intermittent enzyme dosing which, for the first time, enabled long-term operation, high catalytic productivity, and high space-time yield. With the ospCSTR augmented by enzyme dosing, we report an economical process for a chemo-enzymatic epoxidation of sensitive terpenes like e.g., α-pinene.",

The HA nanoparticles have been synthesized by microwave irradiation method using plectranthus amboincus plant-extract as solvent and its properties have been characterized by XRD, FTIR, and SEM methods The plant-extract-mediated HA NP modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) exhibited improved electrocatalytic behavior towards p-cresol sensing compared to bare GCE and pristine HA NP/GCEs. Under optimized conditions, the proposed sensing platform permits the detection of p-cresol over a wide range of 0.275–23.5 × 10−6 M with the lowest detection limit of 116 × 10−9 M (S/N = 3) in phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.0).The fabricated sensor has high selectivity towards p-cresol in the presence of potential interferents such as nitrophenols, bisphenol A, catechol, hydroquinone, uric acid, glucose, folic acid, ascorbic acid and metal ions Na+, K+ and Mg2+. The sensor has been successfully used to detect p-cresol in female buffalo urine which eventually indicates its readiness for artificial insemination.

To this end, metabolic perturbation experiments were performed in parallel to the operating process with cells harvested at two process times of interest: at the beginning of the l-phenylalanine production phase and at the end of the process with decreasing l-phenylalanine production. Data from the parallelised short-term perturbation experiments (19 min) was used for the evaluation of microbial metabolome, fluxome and thermokinetics. This data was to determine local elasticity coefficients and subsequently the global flux control coefficients. Through the application of this methodical setup, several metabolic reactions were identified which control carbon flux towards l-phenylalanine: reactions that consume and produce phosphoenolpyruvate, while enzymes catalysing reactions of the glycerol metabolism were identified as being highly relevant for l-phenylalanine production. A significant change in metabolic control was detected by comparing the flux control coefficients during the two process phases. At decreasing l-phenylalanine production metabolic control appeared to be redirected towards a limiting fructose-6-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate supply. In all, due to the combination of an experimental approach and the framework of metabolic control analysis, improved knowledge about the metabolic network was generated within one single experiment.",

To improve itaconate production, optimization of medium composition was performed and the availability of the critical substrate cis-aconitate was discovered as the limited factor for higher itaconate production. Then native cytoplasmic and mitochondrial aconitase were overexpressed to overcome the limitation, respectively. Furthermore, an efficient strain TJUIA03 with cytoplasmic aconitase was obtained, and the batch and fed-batch fermentations in a bioreactor were implemented, respectively. Finally, the itaconate titer reached to 1.52 g/L in a 3 L bioreactor, with an improvement of 28-fold than that of the strain TJUIA01, which also highlighted areas for future strain improvement compared to the glucose-based fermentation.

Acid-insoluble lignin totaling 12.5% in the pulp does not deteriorate the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis using an enzyme cocktail of commercial BrewZyme BGX and CelloLux-A. At an initial solid loading of 33.3 g/L, a hydrolyzate was obtained with a reducing sugar yield of 93.0% of the overall hydrolyzables. The high yield is assured only by removal of residual, water-soluble, nitrated lignin by water washing. Alcoholic fermentation was run using Saccharomyces сerevisiae Y-1693. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation with delayed inoculation (dSSF) at an initial pulp loading of 90 g/L was found to improve the ethanol yield by 1.2 times compared to separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF), i.e. 0.428 versus 0.343 g/g cellulose, respectively.

     "abstract": "One of the main problems posed by the growth of microalgae is to achieve efficient lighting in the photo-bioreactors (PBRs). Poor distribution of light within the culture can cause that real productivity achieved in large scale reactors is two to three orders of magnitude lower than those achievable with better distributions. Physical and mathematical modeling is a valuable tool for the design and optimization of these type of bioprocesses. In this study, kinetic models of the growth rate of Scenedesmus quadricauda and of the production rate of chlorophylls, were proposed. These models consider the influence of the radiation wavelength composition and of monochromatic light density on microalgal cultures. The parameters of the kinetic model were regressed from experimental data by using a main computer program based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA), supported by a home-built subroutine that consists on a Monte Carlo (MC) simulator for predicting the values of the relevant properties of the radiation field, which was developed in previous work. With the proposed kinetic models, it was possible to achieve the correct simulation of different microalgal cultures carried out in two types of PBRs, illuminated with light of different wavelength composition provided by different light emitting diodes (LEDs) arrangements.",

     "abstract": "The present paper focuses on the development of a population balance model (PBM) accounting for microbial population dynamics in a fluctuating environment. Heterogeneity within the cell population has two origins: extrinsic/intrinsic noises (cell to cell variability due to biological processes) and external noise (due to fluctuations in the cell environment). Modelling the effects of concentration gradients on the population heterogeneity was addressed in previous works using a population balance model based on the specific growth rate. However that model was unable to predict the distribution of specific growth rates experimentally observed at steady state. Using recent experimental data, we now propose a suitable law for the probability that cells growing at a given specific rate produce daughter cells with a different growth rate. Characteristic times of substrate assimilation and mixing at the cell scale are then combined to produce a generic model for substrate uptake limited by micromixing. The simulated results compare favorably to experimental observations leading to a robust multiscale model for bioreactor dynamics combining liquid-cell mass transfer and population heterogeneity.",

The demixing rates of three ILATPSs with different tie-line lengths (TLL) were measured at different DC voltage levels with normal polarity (NP) or reverse polarity (RP), respectively, and the partitioning of ILs and model proteins (including lysozyme and bovine serum albumin) were investigated simultaneously. [Bmim]Cl-K2HPO4 ATPS had higher overall salt concentrations (>15 wt%) and lower overall IL concentrations (<20 wt%) compared with [Bmin]BF4-based ATPSs, which led to faster two phase separation rates and higher efficiency of electrokinetic demixing mainly due to the salting-out effect. The effects of TLL and DC voltage on the dispersing and gathering of IL molecules in the three ILATPS collectively gave the electrokinetic promotion (accelerate ILATPS demixing rate) and electrokinetic inhibition (decelerate ILATPS demixing rate) for the ILATPS demixing. In [Bmim]BF4-NaH2PO4 ATPS, the highest promotion demixing were at TLL = 55, 90 V (RP), while the highest inhibition demixing were at TLL = 64, 150 V (RP). The movement and type of organic cations or inorganic anions of IL molecules played an important role in IL partitioning in the three ILATPSs, which generally caused the partition coefficient of IL to decrease in NP and increase in RP to different degrees. There were two different protein partitioning characteristics in the three ILATPS that most model proteins distributed in the IL-rich phase in [Bmim]Cl-K2HPO4 ATPS due to the salting-out effect and distributed in the salt-rich phase in [Bmim]BF4-based ATPS due to hydrophobic repulsion.

The model is formulated as a set of continuous differentiable equations, which significantly improves model tractability and facilitates the computation of dynamic sensitivities in all relevant stages of fermentation (batch, fed-batch, starvation).

The ribosome binding site (RBS) used was tested and further optimized for each gene to assure an efficient translation. p-Coumaric acid was successfully produced from tyrosine and caffeic acid was produced either from tyrosine or p-coumaric acid using tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) from Rhodotorula glutinis, 4-coumarate 3-hydroxylase (C3H) from Saccharothrix espanaensis or cytochrome P450 CYP199A2 from Rhodopseudomonas palustris.

Hyoscyamine is converted into 6β-hydroxyhyoscyamine and scopolamine by Hyoscyamine-6β-hydroxylase (H6H). Nowadays, these bioactive compounds are obtained from natural producer plants due to the cost and complexity of their chemical synthesis. In the present work we explored the development of an alternative strategy for the production of the most valuable alkaloids, 6β-hydroxyhyoscyamine and scopolamine, using Escherichia coli harboring the H6H enzyme as biocatalysts. In addition, the protein extracts of the induced bacteria were assayed for the transformation of hyoscyamine into the more valuable alkaloids. For this purpose the h6hcDNA, previously amplified from Brugmansia candida total RNA preparations, was inserted in frame to the trx tag into the pET32a(+) vector. E. coli Origami strains were used as host for the expression. The strategy allowed us to produce enough quantities of a soluble and functional enzyme. Protein extracts and whole cells of the induced bacteria were able to transform hyoscyamine into the valuable products. In addition, we found that except from 2-oxoglutarate, no supplementation of the reaction mixture with the cofactors and co-substrates was needed. The process developed in this work is attractive since it could become an alternative to the traditional isolation of 6β-hydroxyhyoscyamine and scopolamine.",

However, because of the impact of electric double layers (EDLs), salt crystals formed on the electrode, thereby potentially retarding the continuity of sulfate removal during the whole operation. Here, an improved MEC reactor using intermittent electric field was established. It works better in sulfate removal for a longer period, which was higher than the conventional MEC reactor by 2.18-fold after 10 days. Observation on the activity of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and ATP revealed that the formation of salt crystals on the electrode led to plasmatorrhexis. Conversely, improved reactor contributed to extracellular substances production and prevented the salt crystal formation, which was conducive to biofilm formation as further verified by detection through SEM. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests showed that the cathodic microorganisms accelerated electron transfer whereas the salt crystals increased the charge transfer resistance. High-throughput sequencing analysis illustrated that improved reactor could maintain the competitiveness of SRB in the microbial community for a longer period. Moreover, the improved reactor resulted in high species diversity, thereby showing the significant resistance of the microorganisms to arduous environments.",

Knockout of carotenoids synthesis (crt) genes resulted in undetectable carotenoids as expected. However, the production of CoQ10 and biomass were both decreased to half as compared to the wild-type strain. In contrast, upon overexpression of ppsR, the production of carotenoids was decreased from 15.7 mg/L to 2.2 mg/L, and the CoQ10 production and content were enhanced by 28% and 34.2%, respectively. To further enhance the production of CoQ10, crtE was constitutively co-overexpressed with ppsR to improve the supply of GGPP as a key precursor for the isoprenoid side chain of CoQ10.

     "abstract": "Microbial kinetics for simultaneous caffeine degradation and its biotransformation to theophylline has been investigated using Fusarium solani. Caffeine was utilized by the fungus as a sole nitrogen source in the presence of sucrose, which served as the primary carbon source. A reaction mechanism involving Monod kinetics with both substrate and product inhibition was formulated based on experimental evidence. A total of thirteen kinetic parameters were involved in the model formulation and these were estimated using simulated annealing algorithm. Moreover, the parameter estimation was carried out for three different experimental sets simultaneously with varying initial sucrose concentration, in order to obtain a common set. Based on sensitivity analysis, among thirteen parameters, saturation constant of biomass accumulation from sucrose utilization (Ks1), yield of biomass from sucrose utilization ( Y X 2 / X 1 ), lumped parameter which was defined as apparent yield of biomass from caffeine degradation process ( Y X 2 / X 3 ), and yield of theophylline from caffeine metabolism ( Y X 4 / X 3 ), were observed to be highly sensitive. The experimental results were in good agreement with the model predictions and have also been validated for an experimental setup which was not used for calibration. The results of the present study has potential application in the development of a process for detoxification of caffeine containing wastes as well as for production of a value added product theophylline.",

The apparent number of NA molecules conjugated per liposome, nNA was estimated on the basis of fluorescence quenching of biotin-4-fluorescein (B4F) in the presence of neutralized avidin-conjugated liposomes (NALs). The NALs possessed the nNA value of (4.2 ± 1.8) × 102 and the mean hydrodynamic diameter of about 150 nm. The biotinylated glucose oxidase and horse radish peroxidase molecules (b-GO and b-HRP) were mixed with NALs at pH 7.5 under the condition that the total concentration of b-GO and b-HRP ([b-GO] = [b-HRP]) is equal to the apparent concentration of NA (500 nM) in the NAL suspension. When the immobilization was performed at [Lipid] = 0.35 mM, a NAL possessed the enzyme activities corresponding to 1.4 free GO and 50 free HRP molecules. The b-GO and b-HRP-immobilized NALs could continuously catalyze the oxidation of glucose with molecular oxygen producing H2O2 which was consumed for the catalytic oxidation of 2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline 6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS2–). The results obtained demonstrate that the reactive bienzyme system can be fabricated under mild conditions by using the NALs as colloidal scaffolds.",

Microbial degradation has been considered as a major route of removing toxic nitriles from the environment. However, the process is very inefficient for degrading benzonitrile herbicides by natural microbes. In this study, a recombinant microbial cell was constructed to degrade benzonitrile herbicides by co-expression of nitrile hydratase and amidase in Escherichia coli. Both enzymes were functionally over-expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli. The NHase activities of the cell reactor on dichlobenil and ioxynil were 15.4 and 21.3 U/mg dry cell weigh (DCW), respectively. And the amidase activities on 2,6-dichlorobenzamide and 3,5-iodo-4-hydroxybenzamide were 8.3 and 13.6 U/mg DCW, respectively. Furthermore, the degradation of dichlobenil and ioxynil was investigated using the recombinant cell reactor. The degradation process suggested that dichlobenil and ioxynil were degraded to corresponding carboxylic acids via nitrile hydratase-amidase pathway, and the intermediate amides (2,6-dichlorobenzamide and 3,5-iodo-4-hydroxybenzamide) did not accumulate in the reaction mixture. The degradation rates of dichlobenil and ioxynil were 43 and 185 mg/g DCW/h, respectively. The recombinant E. coli cell reactor was observed to be promising catalysts for the bioremediation of wastewater containing benzonitrile herbicides.",

At 38 °C, the sensor will selectively detect cholesterol concentration with the detection range of 25–250 mg/dL since P(NIPAAm-co-AAm) is known to shrink above its lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 36 °C, and will separate GOD from analytes so that PMIGC has no catalysis effect on glucose. When the temperature was switched to 25 °C (below LCST), PMIGC could catalyze the oxidation of glucose since GOD will be exposed to analytes due to the swell of P(NIPAAm-co-AAm). This sensor can be used for the detection of glucose with the detection range of 50–700 mg/dL. The optimal detection conditions for cholesterol were achieved with pH 7.0, 40 °C and 10 mg COD (in 75 mg carrier), and those for glucose were achieved with pH6.5, 35 °C and 12 mg GOD (in 90 mg carrier).

In the current study, the effect of goethite on the methanogenesis of acetate was investigated in batch experiment for a period of 105 days. With the increasing dosages of goethite from 0.45 to 90 mM, the methane yield increased from 0.72 to 0.91 mM-CH4 mM-Ace−1, which was significantly higher than the methane yield of the control without goethite supplementation as 0.56–0.64 mM-CH4 mM-Ace−1, indicating that the added goethite had facilitated methanogenesis. The solid in culture was analyzed by electron microscopy. The tight binding of goethite and microbial cells indicated that the promotion of methanogenesis might be caused by the enhancement of syntrophic effect of methanogenic microorganisms through the electron transfer mediated by the (semi)conduct iron oxide goethite. Based on the analysis of the data from various reports, a novel parameter of iron influence factor (R) was proposed, which represented the ratio of available surface site of iron oxide to the concentration of acetate in reactor, and showed that the methanogenesis was facilitated at goethite lgR values of −3 to 0 and suppressed at goethite lgR values of 1.7–3. This study provided novel insights for the evaluation of iron oxides influence on methanogenesis in anaerobic digestion.",

     "abstract": "Despite recent advances in the development of autotrophic denitrification, wherein the electrode is used directly as the electron donor (known as biocathode denitrification), very little attention has been given to this approach for removal of nitrate in real industrial wastewater. This study shows that a bioelectrochemical reactor poised at −0.50 V (vs. a saturated calomel electrode (SCE)) achieved successful nitrate removal from coke wastewater effluent (CWE) sampled from an industrial aeration tank. The results show that direct exposure to CWE initially led to dramatic inhibitory effects, as evidenced by the observed lack of apparent cathodic current and small variations in the concentration of NO3−–N. However, long-term adaptation of the biocathode to the CWE remarkably increased the rate of dinitrification, from 2.35 (Cycle 1) to 4.93 (Cycle 3), 14.4 (Cycle 7) and 16.5 mg NO3−–N L−1 d−1 (Cycle 10). Both confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS) characterizations provided evidence that long-term adaptation can induce recovery of active cells and promote electron transfer between the bacteria and the cathode. Analysis of bacterial structures suggests that cathode-driven autotrophic denitrifiers represented by Thiobacillus play an important role in nitrate reduction.",

In this study, the generally accepted Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) was extended with sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation to optimize the microaeration process during the anaerobic treatment of sulfate-rich wastewater. The resulting model, termed ADM1‐S/O, was validated against experimental data from two reactors operated under anaerobic and microaerobic conditions, showing a good description of H2S concentrations in the biogas. The biomass composition in both reactors was not significantly affected by microaeration. Additionally, scenario analyses were carried out to assess the effect of the influent S:COD ratio and the aeration intensity (O2:S ratio) on the steady state reactor behavior.",

In this work, the concentration of accumulative VFAs during anaerobic digestion with the presence of ZnO ENMs was found to be affected positively compared to the control (without ZnO ENMs). The enhanced VFAs accumulation in the presence of ZnO ENMs was contributed to slowly production and consumption of VFA during anaerobic digestion.

     "abstract": "Nowadays microbial lipids are emerged as a promising biodiesel feedstock. The recovery of intracellular lipids from oleaginous yeasts is an important step for viable application of this new lipid source. This work evaluated six different techniques for cell wall disruption and supercritical fluid assisted by ultrasound (SFE + US) for lipids extraction from oleaginous yeast cultivated in crude glycerol. Among the disruption techniques (which efficiencies ranged from 12 to 125% of the standard method), shear abrasion showed higher efficiency, as qualitatively confirmed by scanning electron microscopy images. SFE + US using CO2 as solvent was performed for lipid extraction in the whole or previous disrupted cells, at different extraction process conditions. The global yield of SFE + US lipid extraction was statistically equal for three pressures studied with maximum of 4.96% (w/w). However, when a disruption technique was previously applied (shear abrasion), the global yield was 6.17% (w/w). The lipid profile was properly for biodiesel application and showed variable results by using different cell disruption techniques. The different SFE + US conditions did not show influence on fatty acid composition. Then this microbial lipids recovery process presented a promising environmentally friendly alternative.",

The ILs assessed belong to the group of Good’s buffer ionic liquids (GBILs), and were prepared by a combination of Good’s buffer-based anions, namely 2-hydroxy-3-morpholinopropanesulfonate and 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonate, and tetrabutylammonium, tetrabutylphosphonium and cholinium cations. These GBILs possess high biocompatibility and buffering capacity at neutral pH region. The protein recovery capabilities of the aqueous solutions of GBILs were compared with conventional buffers, using the same cell disruption approach. After the proper selection of the buffer solution with higher capability to extract microalgal proteins, alternative disruption techniques such as freeze-thaw, non-ionic detergent-based lysis using Triton X-100 and the combined methods were studied.

The influent component fractionation and key stoichiometric and kinetic parameters were obtained based on experiments. The coupled model was verified using a mass balance approach, and can predict the pollutant removal profile and DO concentration accurately. Furthermore, several control strategies were compared by simulating the aeration process in the WWTP. The control strategies were based on two main control structures: (1) feedback ammonia PI (proportional and integral) control structure, and (2) cascade feedforward and feedback ammonia PI control structure. A comprehensive approach was adopted to assess the optimal performance of each control strategy at different setpoints of effluent ammonia concentration and aeration volumes under control. Meanwhile, the interaction between the feedforward controller and the feedback controller was studied. The results show that the feedforward structure was more reliable and effective than the feedback structure in energy saving and effluent quality control. The feedforward controller had a significant effect on the performance of the feedback controller. However, the feedback structure alone could save up to 13.2% aeration energy without worsening the effluent quality under the proper control volume and ammonia load. Therefore, the feedback structure can be used as an upgrade alternative of the current aeration strategy.",

A preliminary techno–economic evaluation of this system using hydrophobic membrane was carried out. The results were compared with conventional absorption. For the assumed membrane, concentrated ethanol (∼66 mass%) might be achieved using vapour permeation whereas absorption achieves 2 mass%, and needs much more distillation to achieve ∼93 mass%.The ethanol recovery costs for base case absorption and for hydrophobic vapour permeation were calculated to be 0.211 and 1.389 US $/kg, respectively. The ethanol recovery cost decreases with increase in membrane permeability in hydrophobic vapour permeation but the base case cost was not achieved.

Nitritation was achieved at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 6.49 h and dissolved oxygen (DO) of 0.5 mg O2/L. Denitrifying phosphate removal via nitrite pathway caused low PHAs consumption. Regardless of change of nitrifying modes, phosphorus removal always maintained at a high level of about 100%. Abundance of total Accumulibacter increased along with rising of carbon to nitrogen ratios (C/N). Under good performance of complete nitrification and nitritation, IIC and IID clade affiliated with type II (including clades II A-I) of Accumulibacter lineage was dominant (70%–80%), respectively. Clade IID exhibited high tolerance to starving, oxygen-limiting and high nitrite accumulation, and thus became dominant clade under insufficient carbon sources, low DO and nitritation mode. Clade IIC had a positive correlation with C/N ratios, and IIF had a positive correlation with temperature (p < 0.05). Shannon index under nitrification and nitritation mode was 3.54 and 2.38, respectively. That indicated the change of Accumulibacter diversities under different operational conditions.",

However, time-dependent irreversible enzyme inactivation caused by the co-substrate H2O2 and the fouling of the filtration membrane are limiting factors. To facilitate rational bioprocess development and reactor design, we present an overall modeling concept for a continuous operating mode that addresses both limitations. When including H2O2-related VP inactivation dynamic model analyses showed that two H2O2 molecules were required to convert one molecule of the reducing substrate (here, adlerol). In this context, an (initial) enzyme inactivation rate k i 0 caused by factors other than H2O2 (e.g. the used buffer system) was introduced. Because oxygen utilization is characteristic of normal POD actions, the continuous online measurement of dissolved oxygen concentration was useful to monitor enzyme inactivation and therefore an excess of H2O2.",

Hence a kinetic study on the effect of multiple factors such as aeration, substrate and product concentration and pH was done in this paper using Neurospora intermedia as a model organism, whose ability to form mycelial pellets was recently reported. The maximum growth rate of the pellets under uninhibited conditions at its optimal growth pH was 0.318 h−1. The pellets were found to be inhibited by high product (ethanol) concentration with no growth occurring at 70 g L−1 and above. High substrate concentration favoured the formation of loose fur-like fluffy pellets.

However, information about the regulation and mechanism of synthesis of QDs with great fluorescence properties is still limited. In this work, we prepared cadmium-selenium (CdSe) QDs in vivo using Candida utilis WSH02-08. We regulated the fluorescence properties of the bio-QDs through different precursor concentrations, and found that the bio-QDs with high fluorescence intensity and long photostable lifetime were favoured at an elevated Cd content over Se. The synthesis of the high-quality bio-QDs was attributed to the less formation of Se(0) and the increased formation of CdSe and CdS.

To prevent methane emissions from effluent, a post-treatment system consisting of two closed downflow hanging sponge (DHS) reactors for the recovery and biological oxidation of dissolved methane was developed. More than 99% of the dissolved methane was completely eliminated using this system under ambient temperatures for 1 year. In this study, the methanotrophic community composition of the two closed DHS reactors was investigated. The performance of the closed DHS reactor was evaluated at different heights of the reactor in summer and winter. The clone libraries and T-RFLP analyses based on the pmoA gene revealed that type I and type II methanotrophs were present in the closed DHS reactors. Furthermore, type I methanotrophs showed wide diversity and contained uncultured phylogenetic clusters of methanotrophs (FWs and LWs), while type II methanotrophs were dominated by Methylocystis- and Methylosarcina-related clusters. The relative abundance of type II methanotrophs increased during winter. The type I methanotroph population dynamically changed with height of the reactor. These results demonstrate the important role of methanotrophs in removal of dissolved methane from upflow anaerobic sludge blanket effluent treating sewage.",

The urease activity of Pararhodobacter sp. increased with cell growth during cultivation and the bacteria maintained its enzyme activity even after 15-days culture. High urease activity was obtained at relatively high temperature around 60 °C and neutral pH around 8. It is revealed that urease was not secreted in culture medium but would accumulate in/on the cell, and resuspended cells obviously showed urease activity. Meanwhile, the enzyme activity was detected in a soluble fraction of cell lysate. Furthermore, clear band based on urease activity was observed in soluble fraction of cell lysate in native PAGE analysis followed by activity staining. These findings will contribute to the efficient biocementation using this ureolytic bacteria.",

In this paper, we describe a novel route for PET depolymerization using enzymes, via glycolysis reactions. Humicola insolens cutinase showed to act better at 60 °C, whereas Candida antarctica lipase B yielded more products at 37 °C. A comparison with hydrolysis reactions at the same conditions (temperature, enzyme loading) revealed that glycolysis favors the accumulation of more esterified end-products, whereas hydrolysis led to more end-products with free carboxyl groups. Molar fractions of the diesterified compound bis(2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate) of up to 0.88 was observed during glycolysis, revealing that it was the main depolymerization product. These findings add new relevant knowledge for the integration of depolymerization products in existing PET production industrial plants.",

In addition, the targeted biotinylation process does not affect the osteogenic properties of the protein when free in solution or after its functional immobilization onto “bone cement” (Vaishya et al., 2013) [5] materials.

Results revealed the existence of considerable delays in the microalgae response, even when imposing conditions promoting null microalgal activity. Even an extremely unfavourable condition such as 1500 mg L−1 of total ammonia nitrogen and pH 9 takes about 24 h to induce complete inhibition. The existence of DIR may cause serious deviations between predictions given by traditional models and real behaviour of a culture.

The pyranose oxidase enzyme (PROD), immobilized on the surface of AuNPs modified LAPS chip, could catalyze the hydrolysis of 1,5-AG and produce a reductive product H2O2 that enhanced the deposition of Ag. When a bias voltage was provided to the LAPS, a photocurrent which depended on the concentration of 1, 5-AG can be generated. Because the concentration of Ag ions in the electrolyte solution decreased with the deposition of metallic Ag on the surface of AuNPs modified LAPS chip, the potential shift (ΔV) has originated from local surface potential changes and reflected the changes of 1,5-AG concentration. The linear relationship between ΔV and 1,5-AG concentration were very well over the range from 60 μg/mL to 225 μg/mL with a correlation coefficient of 0.9977.

However, the low fermentation yield is a bottleneck to limit its further industrialization and clinical applications. To address this issue, a genome-scale dynamic flux balance analysis (GS-DFBA) model was developed to seek for the bottlenecks of FK506 biosynthesis. After validating under different cultural conditions, lots of targets were predicted successfully with help of Minimization of Metabolic Adjustment (MOMA). Specifically, many uncover targets that heretofore had remained hidden in the complex interconnectedness of central metabolism had also shown significant effects on FK506 accumulation. To validate the model predictions, four identified targets (gcdh, tktB, msdh and ask gene) were engineered in Streptomyces tsukubaensis NRRL18488. All of the engineered strains showed a higher FK506 production, compared with the parent strain. Finally, the best strain HT-△gcdh-tktB/msdh/ask with gcdh-deletion and tktB-, msdh- and ask-overexpression could produce 126.61 ± 4.66 mg/L FK506, 129.8% higher than that of the wild-type strain (55.1 ± 3.83 mg/L).

Carbonic anhydrase (CA) can efficiently catalyze the interconversion between CO2 and HCO3−, which may help accelerate karst processes. To explore the influence of bacterial CA on CO2 capture capacity in CO2-H2O-carbonate system, a flow dissolution experimental device was designed to simulate CO2 absorption by rainwater infiltration or surface water flushing. Results showed that, when bacterial CA was added into the experimental system, it increased not only the rate but also the quantity of CO2 absorption, and the CO2 captured by limestone or dolomite dissolution increased by at least 18.9% and 22.1%, respectively. However, excessively high concentration of CO2 was not conducive to carbonate rock dissolution by bacterial CA. In accordance with the fixed carbon caused by global carbonate dissolution, the contribution of soil CA to the CO2 sinks may reach 0.567–1.938 × 1014gC/a. In summary, the addition of microbial CA could increase the CO2 capture in the form of DIC in CO2-H2O-carbonate system, thereby increasing the carbon sink potential of karst systems.

     "abstract": "Packed-bed bioreactors (PBRs) have been recognized as a breakthrough technology in industrial wastewater treatment plants due to high removal efficiency and low investment and operating cost. A coupled computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model, combining the fluid dynamics with biochemical reactions was developed to simulate the dynamic behavior of formaldehyde (FA) biodegradation by Ralstonia eutropha in an immobilized cell bioreactor with disk-shaped Kissiris pieces operating in batch-recycling and continuous mode. The multiphase CFD model was investigated to promote the design, optimization and scale-up of the existent environmental technologies on the decontamination of aqueous streams. The Eulerian CFD model was developed to evaluate the effect of different inlet substrate concentrations (1.67–20 mol/m3 of FA) and feed flow rates (6–60.3 mL/min) on the treatment efficiency under unsteady-state condition by visualizing concentration profiles for FA depletion. To validate the CFD model effectively, the theoretical calculations were compared against experimental biodegradation data reported in the literature and the time-dependent simulation results illustrated a satisfactory agreement with the experimental data. The results clearly demonstrated that the bioreactor operating in batch-recycling mode was more efficient in means of pollutant elimination while increasing the feed flow rate and inlet FA concentration had reverse effect on FA removal efficiency of the bioreactor. The Eulerian computations have shown promising results on how fluid dynamics can be correlated with biochemical reaction model (Luong inhibition model) and reasonably predict the formaldehyde concentration variations along the bioreactor.",

This study focuses on clarification of a monoclonal antibody by precipitation of the model impurity bovine serum albumin (BSA) with cationic polyelectrolytes. Different types of cationic polyelectrolytes with different functional amine groups and molecular weights are screened for their capability to precipitate BSA in mixture with mAb. Due to the high BSA depletion and mAb recovery achieved, two cationic polyelectrolytes, polyethyleneimine (PEI) and polyallylamine (PAA) with a molecular weight of 65 kDa were selected as most suitable precipitation agents. Additionally, influences of different parameters (polyelectrolyte, BSA and NaCl concentration and pH value) were analyzed by the use of design of experiments (DoE). Herewith, a fast identification of influencing factors and factor interaction was achieved. With DoE, two regression models for the analysis of BSA depletion in dependence of influencing factors were established. This enabled the analysis of the robustness of precipitation as initial clarification step of downstream process of mAb.",

Reynolds stress, turbulent eddy length, cell growth and viability, limonoid production, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) response were analyzed. The most suitable treatment for biomass generation corresponded to shake flask (maximum of 15.69 ± 0.47 g DW/L), whereas limonoid production was favored at 400 rpm (8.37 ± 3.81 mg/g DW). Reynolds stress reached 62.21 ± 8.65 Pa at 800 rpm, and turbulent eddies were similar to the aggregate size. This affected cell growth and viability, while ROS concentration increased significantly (156.1 ± 104.2 FU/min) and GPX activity remained low, 0.04 ± 0.00 μmol TG/(mg protein min), suggesting hydrodynamic stress conditions.

     "abstract": "Existing population models of bacteria and phages have most commonly described single well-mixed reactors. Whilst crucial to gain an understanding of population dynamics, these models are not directly applicable to scenarios requiring multi-reactor models. Using standard approaches we have formulated these models to describe behaviour within multiple interconnected reactors. A model incorporating phage dynamics in wastewater treatment systems was then developed to investigate the potential use of phages as a tool to reduce foaming or bulking. The model couples wastewater treatment dynamics within the commercial software GPS-X (Hydromantis Inc.) with phage dynamics through a newly developed add-on called PhageDyn. Simulations predict that immediately after phage dosing there is a lag period during which no apparent changes are observed, which is followed by a sudden and quick increase in the phage concentration and reduction in foaming biomass. “Normalization” without foaming is achieved within 1–2 weeks after dosing. The system may subsequently relapse back to foaming, requiring additional phage dosing, or be “cured” such that the added phages keep the problematic foaming biomass indefinitely at bay. Kinetic parameters describing the behaviour of the phages, as well as reactor configuration, are key determinants of the final outcome. The model is useful for predicting potential behaviour and for determining the characteristics of phages that are likely to be successful, assisting in isolation and screening.",

The purpose of this work was to develop a trickle-bed reactor (TBR) to improve mass transfer of CH4 and oxygen (O2) to methanotroph growth media for enhanced CH4 oxidation and methanol production. Mass transport of O2 in a TBR packed with ceramic balls was nearly two-fold higher than an unpacked TBR. CH4 oxidation in the TBR (0.4–0.6 mmol/h) was about four times higher than that in shake flasks that used similar inoculum and headspace:volume and biogas:air ratios. Using optimal operating parameters (biogas:air = 1:2.5, 12 mmol formate addition, 3.6 mmol phosphate), methanol productivity (0.9 g/L/d) from the non-sterile TBR was among the highest reported in the literature.

Therefore, the signal peptide-dependent protein translocation pathway is clearly crucial for the sucrose intolerance of SacB-expressing E. coli.

These reactors used magnetic supports or beads with immobilized enzymes as the solid phase. All published researches from the early beginning after the middle of the last century to the present time are discussed and analyzed. These papers used the magnetic field for several purposes including mixing, attracting the particles to prevent their washout from the column and to operate with higher substrate velocities to enhance mass transfer processes. It was found that axial magnetic field is the most preferable for most researchers. In addition, most of the magnetic particles were prepared by entrapment. Many enzymes such as Glucose oxidase, Urase and Hydrolase were immobilized on different supports in these reactors. In most applications, the magnetic field indirectly enhances the immobilized enzymatic activity and the conversion rate. This enhancement is attributed to the improved mass transfer process between the liquid medium and the immobilized enzyme since the applied magnetic field enables an intensive mixing or the operation with higher medium flow rates. Some comments were presented at the end of the review which shows the gaps in this promising application.",

Enzymes are widely applied in the bioindustrial manufacture of bulk and fine chemicals which eventually find application in various areas e.g. food and feed products, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. However, enzymatic processes often suffer from substrate and/or product inhibition, unfavourable equilibria, unwanted product (bio)transformation, and a low stability of the enzyme. Research efforts have been directed towards addressing these drawbacks to a certain extent. This review provides an overview of literature citing examples that use different (membrane based) strategies to intensify enzymatic processes resulting in an increase in the product yield, process productivity, and/or stability of the enzyme. The strategies are described in detail under four major headings namely enzyme membrane reactors, membrane contactors, cascade reactions, and sorption. These are illustrated with cases for the production of peptides from proteins, oligo- and monosaccharides from different polysaccharides such as cellulose, lactose, pectin, chitosan, etc., esters and enantio-pure products from different substrates.",

Recently, we produced pectinases in a pilot-scale packed-bed bioreactor, growing Aspergillus niger on a substrate mixture consisting of 27 kg of wheat bran and 3 kg of sugarcane bagasse (dry mass). However, the agglomeration of particles and shrinkage of the bed created preferential flow paths, leading to overheating within the bed and poor uniformity of pectinase levels at the end of the fermentation. In the current work, we used intermittent agitation as a strategy to minimize agglomeration, comparing one agitation (10 h), three agitations (at 8, 10 and 12 h) and five agitations (every 2 h from 8 to 16 h). The pectinase activity in the bed was uniform after agitation, but poor uniformity occurred when the bed was left unmixed for more than 10 h. The best regime was that with three agitations: For 15 samples removed from different vertical and horizontal positions of the bed at 20 h, the average pectinase activity was 22 U g−1, with a sample standard deviation of 2 U g−1.

One of the reasons for this, could be the lack of knowledge on the enzyme inhibition mechanisms. Therefore, for the first time, here we investigated mechanisms of XR inhibition by major LDBs using XR from Debaryomyces nepalensis. We found that phenol showed competitive inhibition of XR whereas gallic acid, vanillin, furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and acetate exhibited mixed inhibition. The inhibitory constants (KI) of vanillin, phenol, gallic acid, furfural, HMF and acetate were found to be 0.1, 11, 32, 54, 45 and 100 mM respectively. Moreover, the enzyme stability was drastically affected in the presence of phenols. In addition, molecular docking simulations performed using AutoDock 4.2.6 program revealed the putative binding sites of LDBs on XR and corroborated the experimental data.",

     "abstract": "The flocs generated by different coagulants under various coagulation mechanisms produce fundamentally different floc characteristics. In this investigation, the fractal dimensions of aggregates produced by the different types of coagulants and coagulation mechanisms to drilling wastewater were described with image-based techniques. The flocs properties, which were evaluated in terms of floc strength, size and structure, formed by non-composite, polyferric chloride (PFC), and by a novel composite coagulant, polyferric chloride −polydimethyldiallylammonium chloride (PFC-PDM), were comparatively investigated. Besides, an intrinsic unity of relation among the floc properties under various coagulation mechanisms was also reported. It was found that the composite coagulant could exhibit better bridging capacity during coagulation process. Fractal dimension analysis revealed that PFC-PDM tended to form more regular and compact flocs with larger Dpf value than PFC formed. The results clearly demonstrated that the size of PFC-PDM-floc was larger than that of PFC-floc. Additionally, the PFC-PDM-flocs strength were higher than PFC-flocs, indicating that the aggregated flocs induced by the composite coagulant could be more resistant to shear and more recoverable than those induced by the non-composite coagulant. Those presented above results indicate that PFC-PDM may be used as alternative coagulant during wastewater treatment process with some capacities exceeding that of PFC, providing there is an economic and practical method to improve floc properties from its application.",

The results showed that compared with reductions in BaP concentration, the extent of BaP degradation and denitrification was significantly affected by C/N ratios. The Microbacterium sp. strain could use the denitrifying products nitric oxide and nitrous oxide as electron acceptors to degrade BaP and the shortage of electron acceptors did not decrease the BaP removal rates but lead to a decrease in the BaP degradation. The degree of degradation of BaP could be controled by adding appropriate nitrate (nitrite) which calculated based on the fitting equations of the relationship between nitrate (nitrite) consumption and BaP removal amount. The Microbacterium sp. strain performed better under nitrate-reducing condition, and the highest removal rate (84.2%) was obtained at the BaP/nitrate ratio of 1:33 in 10 d.

To this aim, lab-scale anaerobic digestion experiments of Chlorella vulgaris after lipid extraction were carried out to evaluate biogas yield and nutrients recovery in the liquid digestate. Then, this liquid fraction was used as source of nutrients for cultivation of a closely related C. vulgaris species, in order to assess the possibility of re-cultivating microalgae towards a closed-loop nutrient recycling process. The biological methane potential tests resulted in biogas production of about 347 NmL gVS−1 with 43% v/v methane content. In re-growth experiments, the liquid digestate showed an insufficient amount of soluble sulfate and phosphorus. However, by amending these two nutrients, the specific growth rate and final biomass concentration increased to about 2 d−1 and 2 g L−1, respectively, which were comparable to those obtained in a defined control medium. The low content of soluble phosphorus in liquid digestate was mainly due to precipitation and removal with the solid phase. Several techniques were hence tested to enhance phosphorus solubilisation, and highest recoveries of up to 41% were obtained when using NaHCO3. Finally, C. vulgaris was grown in such treated digestate, obtaining a final biomass production comparable to that of the control, without the need of external phosphorus supply.",

     "abstract": "A new approach to rapidly initiate biofilm induced by famine incubation was developed in a membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR). The correlation between extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) component, surface physiochemical properties of biofilm, and biofilm formation rate was evaluated. The results indicated that famine incubation appeared to stimulate bacteria to secrete more bound EPS and resulted in improvement in surface properties of cells in the culture favoring the accumulation of biofilm flocs onto the membrane surface. High contents of bound EPS and bound protein along with the reduced surface charges enhanced hydrophobicity of bacteria. Biofilm formation rate strongly correlated with EPS component and bindability rather than the concentration of total EPS. The study suggested that famine incubation may provide an alternative tool to initiate the rapid formation of biofilm by regulating the component and surface characteristics of biofilm-EPS matrix, which enhanced the efficacy of membrane-aerated biofilm (MAB) for high-rate organic carbonaceous pollutant biodegradation, volatile organic pollutant removal, and nitrification/denitrification processes.",

With different light irradiation, there is approximately a 15% influence on the relative activity of the immobilized pectinase.

The results showed that the model established can effectively describe the sludge transport and concentration distribution in the SSSAB.

     "abstract": "The application of cell-based therapeutics requires development of refined and scalable culture processes. Stirred tank bioreactors facilitate growth of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) while meeting these needs. A process for expansion of hMSCs in a 50 L bioreactor was developed. Parameters evaluated include agitation rate, pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) control set-points, and media formulation. The pH and DO levels were determined empirically in 3 L bioreactors prior to implementation at the 50 L scale. The agitation operating range for microcarrier cultures in the 50 L bioreactor was calculated based on theoretical and empirical analyses of solid suspension and shear limitations. Additionally, small-scale experiments demonstrated that hMSC growth was improved in αMEM supplemented with human platelet lysate in comparison to DMEM supplemented with FBS. A 43-fold expansion of harvested hMSCs was achieved in 11 days in a 50 L bioreactor incorporating these process improvements. Cells expanded in the bioreactor exhibited the expected surface marker expression, trilineage differentiation potential, T cell growth inhibition and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase inducibility. The results highlight that identification of optimal pH, DO, agitation rates and culture medium for microcarrier-based bioreactor expansion of adherent cells is paramount to developing a platform to support cell-based therapies.",

Based on product inhibition and solids concentration constraints, a model was proposed for operation of the membrane-recycle bioreactor. SSF should be run in batch mode into the fermentor for 48 h, and then switch-on recirculation through the filtration module, with pulsed fed-batch addition of recycled paper sludge.This innovative approach can be applied to improve other SSF processes dealing with high-solids concentrations, towards cost-effective lignocellulosic feedstock biorefineries.",

The sorption of the medium components onto the fermented solid follows a multicomponent Langmuir isotherm, while the kinetic equation is expressed in terms of the composition of the sorbed phase. With a single set of parameters, the model adjusted well to the experimental results obtained by Soares et al. for three different ethanol to fatty acid molar ratios (1:1, 1.5:1 and 3:1), not only for the overall conversion profile, but also for the compositions of the bulk phase and the sorbed phase.

To improve PAC formation with S. cerevisiae various Pdc isoforms isolated from an industrial PAC producing yeast strain and mutant versions thereof were characterized. However, none of them could improve PAC production indicating that carboligase activity might not be limiting. In industrial processes the maximal yield of PAC is reduced due to the conversion of benzaldehyde to by-products benzyl alcohol and benzoic acid. Expression of a heterologous carboxylic acid reductase could efficiently re-cycle benzoic acid back to benzaldehyde. By reducing NADPH synthesis the formation of benzyl alcohol was significantly diminished. With these modifications the PAC/benzyl alcohol ratio could be increased more than four times compared to the reference strain.",

The performance was assessed by operating laboratory scale of 1 L simulated MESTs for 171 days at an average HRT of 8.3 days. MESTs utilized inexpensive electrode material of stainless steel AISI 430, and were operated at small external voltage input (from 0.50 V to 0.88 V) and low energy consumption (0.26–37.1 kWh/m3-treated sewage). Total phosphorus (P) removal efficiency was substantially improved by MESTs from 12.2% to 77.2%–98.7% at 25 °C, and from 7.45% to 20.7%–93.9% at 15 °C. Sulfide was completely removed from most MESTs effluents, while the CSTs generated sulfide concentrations of 0.17 mM and 0.06 mM at the respective two temperatures. Comparison of MESTs with other alternative systems like engineered ecosystems and membrane bioreactor showed its substantial effectiveness in P removal and its readiness to be incorporated in current septic systems. In conclusion, MESTs decreased the P load that enters the subsequent percolation field, and the adoption of MESTs would enhance the overall role of septic systems in sanitation and environmental protection.",

Two (αβγ)2 XDH variants, Split166 and Split178, which were designed by splitting the small subunit of R. capsulatus CGMCC 1.3366 (αβ)2 XDH at the N- and C-terminal ends of the L167-A178 peptide linking the iron–sulfur clusters and flavin adenine dinucleotide domains, respectively, were expressed in E. coli.

In addition, binding behaviors of IgG and BSA in column were studied with MMI-B-4FF-100 at various pH values, and the optimized separation conditions were obtained as loading at pH 7.0 and elution at pH 4.0. Furthermore, IgG was effectively separated from IgG/BSA protein mixtures with MMI-B-4FF-100. The purities of IgG monomer reached above 95%, and the recovery kept about 90%. The results indicated that MMI-B-4FF-100 with high ligand density and moderate pore size would be a promising HCIC resin for IgG purification.",

A wide temperature range is used to estimate the temperature-dependent kinetic parameters of the reaction kinetics.

The calculated reaction rates are used to construct a mechanistic fed-batch model. Experimental data from several cycles of very-high-gravity (VHG) ethanol fermentation from sugarcane are used to validate the model. Acceptable predictions are achieved in terms of the residual standard deviation (RSD). In addition, a suitable fermentation temperature profile, nutrient supplementation and micro-aeration during cell treatment are essential factors to obtain a yield of up to 90%, with a productivity of 10.2 g/L h and an ethanol concentration of 120 g/L.",

Generally, the DNA fragments of these heterologous metabolic pathways are constructed via the classic restriction digestion and ligation method. In contrast, the one-step in vivo pathway assembly method has been only rarely applied to Y. lipolytica. Here, with arachidonic acid biosynthesis as a case study, a one-step in vivo pathway assembly and integration method was used for engineering Y. lipolytica. Using rDNA as integrative locus, this study showed that there was a relation between the assembly efficiency and the length of overlapping region. Especially, with an overlap up to 1 kb, the method was able to rapidly assemble the arachidonic acid biosynthesis pathway (nearly 10 kb) into the chromosome with high efficiency (nearly 23%). Meanwhile, the pathway assembled in Y. lipolytica demonstrated long-term genetic stability and the engineered strain exhibited robust growth. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the codon-optimized genes from Mortierella alpina can function efficiently in Y. lipolytica: a high level arachidonic acid production (0.4% of total fatty acids) was produced in the engineered strain. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this method is applied to Y. lipolytica for functional polyunsaturated fatty acids production. This method represents a powerful tool with potential for facilitating engineering applications in non-conventional yeasts.",

The effects of fluoride ions on microbial growth relevant to bioleaching have been extensively emphasized. However, the reasons that the microorganisms present different fluoride tolerance in bioleaching of different minerals have not yet been proposed. A fundamental exploration on the differential fluoride tolerance of sulfur- and ferrous iron-grown Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans was performed. The results showed that the critical fluoride concentration for sulfur-grown A. ferrooxidans was less than 0.1 mM whenever fluoride was introduced. The critical fluoride concentration for ferrous iron-grown A. ferrooxidans was 1.0 mM when fluoride was introduced prior to the lag phase, but it was higher than 10.0 mM when fluoride was introduced at the log phase. The ferric ions generated from ferrous oxidation could significantly decrease the concentration of HF and finally reduce the toxicity of fluoride to A. ferrooxidans. The changes of concentration of metal ions with strong complex ability to fluoride ions, resulted in an illusion of high fluorine-resistant strain in industrial bioleaching heap. Finally, the feasibility of fluoride removal by ferric ion was put forward. This work has meaningful implications for the industrial bioleaching of high-fluorine containing uranium ore.",

In our previous study, the growth and MEV production of AM1-dcel-mvt strain were found to be unstable in the culture media tested (CHOI, MP, MC and HP), which contained ammonium salts, magnesium, calcium, buffers, methanol and trace elements. In this study, we developed a novel MC medium based on MP and CHOI, which improved the growth rate and the reproducibility and replicability of culture process considerably. AM1-dcel-mvt cells cultivated in MC displayed a more homogenous doubling time than cells in other media, which could explain their more stable growth. The optimized MO medium containing a higher phosphate buffer concentration and lower trace elements was developed, which enhanced MEV production by 0.61-fold to 340 mg/L. In fed-batch fermentation in a 5 L fermenter, a MEV titre of 2.59 g/Land a dry cell weight (DCW) of 9.03 g/L were obtained, representing the highest MEV production reported to date for the AM1-dcel-mvt strain.

     "abstract": "This study investigated the degradation of the herbicide isoproturon using Trametes versicolor laccase and its laccase-mediator systems. Isoproturon was poorly degraded with laccase alone, due to the presence of the relatively strong withdrawing electron group (NHCON(CH3)2) in the chemical structure of isoproturon. This study showed that laccase-mediator systems can effectively enhance the degradation rate of isoproturon. Within 24 h, isoproturon was completely degraded in the presence of 0.3 U/mL laccase and 1 mM 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT). Compared with natural mediators, synthetic mediators are more effective in the laccase-mediated degradation of isoproturon. However, laccase activity rapidly declined in the presence of the synthetic mediator HBT. Degradation occurred at an acidic pH and optimum temperature was 50 °C. A high concentration (10 mM) of metal ions Cu2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+ positively enhanced isoproturon degradation with the laccase-HBT system. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) can reduce the HBT dosage in isoproturon degradation with the laccase-HBT system and enhance the degradation rate of isoproturon by increasing laccase stability. Moreover, a higher degradation rate of isoproturon was observed when incubating isoproturon with the laccase-HBT system in real wastewater compared to that in sodium citrate buffer. Finally, transformation products showed much lower ecotoxicity to green algae than the original isoproturon. This study concludes that laccase-mediator systems have great potential to treat industrial wastewater containing the herbicide isoproturon.",

Lipomyces starkeyi, cultivated in hemicellulosic hydrolysate (HH) from sugarcane bagasse composed of 14.0 g/L xylose, 2.9 g/L glucose, 2.6 g/L arabinose, 2.6 g/L acetic acid, 0.04 g/L furfural and 0.02 g/L 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), was not inhibited by HMF, furfural or acetic acid. Furthermore, the inhibitors were depleted during fermentation, possibly due to yeast metabolism. This assumption was supported by analysis of the L. starkeyi genome, which confirmed the presence of key genes related to inhibitor metabolism. Furthermore, a preliminary fermentation using only acetic acid as the carbon source indicated that L. starkeyi was able to use acetic acid (∼3.0 g/L) for cell growth (0.9 g/L) and biosynthesis of lipids (28.4%,w/w). L. starkeyi showed favorable and robust characteristics as a promising microorganism able to convert HH sugars into lipids without previous detoxification.",

Supplementation with lactate decreased cell proliferation and cell number.

The applicability of these reaction cascades is still limited due to enzyme inhibition and deactivation which impair the first – enzymatic – step and thus hinder the following chemical step. To overcome these limitations, a new strategy for the synthesis of peracids was investigated. This is based on a continuous stirred tank reactor and the avoidance of liquid/liquid interfaces by performing the reaction in a single-phase organic solution. With this strategy, full enzymatic activity could be maintained for 50 h, doubling the literature benchmark. The peroxyacetic acid yield with respect to hydrogen peroxide was up to 70%.

In particular, when a net proliferation of filamentous bacteria occurred (during period III with a higher number of cycles per day) both EPSs concentration and filamentous abundance influence the modified scum index obtained after two purification steps (MSI2). Finally, the processing data show that the EPSs hampered also the membrane filtration but improve the pre-filtration action of cake layer.

The performance of self‐agitated impellers was evaluated through comparative analysis of the obtained volumetric mass transfer coefficient values with regard to liquid phase properties and sparger types. Compared to the configuration without impellers, self‐agitated impellers considerably improved reactor characteristics by increasing volumetric mass transfer coefficient up to 82% at smaller superficial gas velocities. At higher gas velocities, corresponding to aeration conditions operated in most cultivation, values of volumetric mass transfer coefficient were 20–30% higher with the insertion of impellers. The effective viscosity played a key role in defining the magnitude of the impellers’ effect on the improvement of volumetric mass transfer coefficient. Superficial gas velocity and sparger design influenced impellers efficiency as well. The highest improvements of volumetric mass transfer coefficient were achieved in the most viscous carboxylmethylcellulose solution by using the least effective type of sparger. Besides proposed empirical correlations, which gave an average relative error of 9.1%, an artificial neural network was also successfully developed to estimate the volumetric mass transfer coefficient.

Here we present a screening and selection of carriers for immobilization of Aureobasidium pullulans cells with potential for yielding high FOS production. Synthetic, agro-industrial by-products and mineral materials were tested and selected regarding their ability to immobilize cells, as well as their potential to produce FOS, through shaken-flask fermentations. Increased amounts of immobilized cells were found for carriers with higher porosity observed at the microscope, higher water absorption index (WAI) and lower critical humidity point (CHP). Reticulated polyurethane foam was one of the most efficient synthetic carriers immobilizing cells (over 75% (w/w) of the total cells were immobilized). Also, high FOS production was obtained: FOS concentration, purity and yield increased in 15, 8 and 12% (w/w), respectively, as compared to free cells conditions. Although walnut shell had a much lower immobilization efficiency, the high amount of cells grown while using this carrier led to a highest increment of FOS concentration, purity and yield, namely, 27, 10 and 25% (w/w). Cells immobilization with the selected carriers holds great promise for FOS production on a larger scale.",

Although lignocellulosic biomasses such as rice husk contain a substantial amount of amorphous silica, the role of silica in enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose is poorly understood. In this study, the interaction of silica with a cellulase enzyme (CTec2) was studied by addressing the role of silica in cellulase adsorption and cellulose (avicel) hydrolysis. CTec2 adsorption on silica surface was found to be influenced by temperature, pH and contact time. The adsorption equilibrium data fitted the Langmuir isotherm model better than the Freundlich isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity (Qm) of silica was found to be as high as 244 mg/g at a temperature of 50 °C and pH of 4.0, indicating strong interaction between silica and CTec2. This strong interaction inhibited avicel hydrolysis; consequently the maximum sugar yield was only 32%. The inhibitory effect of silica was almost completely minimized by introducing PEG1500, and the sugar yield reached 78%, similar to that (81%) obtained in the silica-free system. The results of this paper could, therefore, be useful in designing cellulase-catalyzed hydrolysis of silica containing cellulosic biomasses.",

An extremely high nitrogen removal rate (NRR) of 2.83 kg N m−3 d−1 was achieved, due to the high specific NRR of huge biomass in the reactor. With the improvement of granular structure compactness, it was believed that the EPS accumulation could be beneficial to enhance nitrogen removal performance of granules. In addition, high-throughput pyrosequencing analysis revealed that a co-culture of aerobic and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria, affiliated to genera Nitrosomonas and Candidatus Kuenenia respectively, had been established in mature CANON granules, while the growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria (Nitrospira spp.) was effectively suppressed through substrate competitions between three groups of bacteria.

     "abstract": "The water content (WCR) of packing materials is a key factor that determines the success of biofilters, particularly thermophilic bioreactors, for off-gas treatment. An optimum WCR can be accomplished by directly irrigating packing materials. In this study, the performance of a thermophilic biofilter for SO2 removal was investigated by different irrigation times. The removal efficiency of SO2 was largely influenced by the water content of packing materials, which varied with irrigation time. An average SO2 removal efficiency of 98% could be achieved when WCR was >80%. The thermophilic biofilter required daily irrigation to maintain the optimum WCR. Oxygen distribution varied in polyurethane foam cubes (PUFCs) at different WCRs. PUFCs with a high WCR provided aerobic-low oxygen-aerobic areas. Microbial population also varied accordingly. For the thermophilic biofilter in treating SO2, over 80% was the optimal WCR which could be achieved by continuous irrigation.",

It was noticed that there was significant fructose accumulation during l-serine fermentation process using sucrose as substrates, which is the preferred carbon resource for this strain. Lack of fructokinase may be responsible for poor fructose utilization. In the present study, a shortcut pathway for fructose utilization has been constructed via heterologous expression of scrK (fructokinase). Furthermore, pfkA (phosphofructokinase) was over-expressed to avoid over accumulation of fructose-6-phosphate, the resulting strain showed significantly improved cell growth and l-serine accumulation. In a 5-L bioreactor, the engineered C. glutamicum strain produced 30.6 g/L l-serine (0.99 mol/mol sucrose yield, with a theoretical maximal yield of 4 mol/mol sucrose), whereas the reference strain produced 20.54 g/L l-serine (with a yield of 0.67 mol/mol sucrose) at 120 h. After two feedings of sucrose, the l-serine production increased up to 37.0 g/L at 96 h.",

Study of the best culture conditions made possible a significant increase in production. The optimal culture conditions used minimal medium containing crude glycerol as the carbon source, starting the batch with 100 g/L, and subsequently making four pulses of this crude glycerol, of 25 g/L each. The lipase produced was characterized and compared to commercially available lipase from Aspergillus niger, sold by Novozymes. rLip B proved to be stable in basic pHs and temperatures lower than 55 °C, the optimum conditions being pH 7.0 and 30 °C. The selectivity for medium-sized carbon chains was similar in both, and tributyrine (C4:0) was the best triacylglycerol studied.

With this strategy, acetone production was enhanced while NADH dependent butanol synthesis rate was adequately restricted by glucose limitation via decreasing initial glucose concentration in the medium and adaptively adding acetate/S. cerevisiae during solventogenic phase. Under these conditions, acetone production ability of C. acetobutylicum could be fully utilized by delaying butanol inhibition occurrence time; favorable environment for acetone production was created while incomplete ABE fermentation due to glucose limitation avoided. The proposed strategy could arbitrarily control or maximize acetone concentration and acetone/butanol ratio (A/B) in the ranges of 6–12 g/L and 0.5–1.0, the maximum values could reach the levels of 11.74 g/L and 1.02 which would potentially promote ABE fermentative products flexibility and bio-acetone productions using renewable biomass. The theoretical analysis of A/B ratio based on carbon mass and energy balances showed that, the maximum A/B ratio of 1.04 could be achieved when 60 g/L glucose and 12 g/L acetate were consumed by C. acetobutylicum, which coincided with the experimental data (1.02) well.",

Their concentrations produced in MFC were higher than those in the fermentation system, as well as additional electricity could be recovered in MFC. Furthermore, the degradation of GlcNAc (the intermediate of chitin hydrolysis) by S. oneidensis MR-1 was faster than chitin in MFC and fermentation systems.

As such, a flow cell reactor simulating the hydrodynamic conditions found in CAUTIs (shear rate of 15 s−1) was used to characterize the microbial physiology of E. coli and D. tsuruhatensis individually and in consortium, in terms of the growth kinetics and substrate uptake. Single-species biofilms showed that up to 48 h the cultivable cell counts significantly increased for both species (p < 0.05). When in dual-species biofilm, E. coli outnumbered D. tsuruhatensis up to 16 h and then D. tsuruhatensis gained a fitness advantage. However, the assessment of the spatial distribution of the dual-species biofilm by LNA/2′OMe-FISH revealed that E. coli and D. tsuruhatensis coexist and tend to co-aggregate over time, which suggests that both bacteria are able to cooperate synergistically. Substrate uptake measurements revealed that D. tsuruhatensis metabolized citric acid more rapidly, presumably leaving more uric acid available in the medium to be used by E. coli. In conclusion, E. coli and uncommon bacteria seem to cooperate, when sharing the same environment under dynamic conditions, leading to the persistence of both bacteria in a stable microbial community.",

We constructed a fumaric acid production strain with reduced ethanol yield by deleting the FUM1 gene in pdc1adh1 cells, and RoPYC was found to be more beneficial for fumaric acid production than ScPYC2. In particular, among the 19 RoPYC mutants, only overexpression of the P474N mutant in the pdc1adh1fum1 cells led to a significant increase in fumaric acid production with a yield of 314.5 ± 3.8 mg l−1 at 96 h of fermentation, when compared with the wild-type RoPYC (252 ± 17.0 mg l−1).

Rate constants of the biogas production were typical for substrates with high fibre and lignin content (0.05–0.08 d−1).It has been shown that the improvement of biogas potential and biogas composition in terms of methane content could have been obtained by co-digestion of GS and AS with PS.

This cationic PEI, as the mineralization-inducing agent, catalyzes the condensation of silicate to form silica (biomimetic silicification) on the rGO surface, where enzyme is simultaneously entrapped. The resultant rGO/FeOOH/silica hydrogel shows an extraordinary three-dimensional (3D) porous structure. The silica content on the rGO surface can be facilely tailored through changing the silica precursor concentration. Combined with monolithic macroscale of the rGO/FeOOH/silica hydrogel, the acquired monolithic biocatalytic systems display easy recyclability and elevated pH/thermal/recycling/storage stabilities during the catalytic production of 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) in comparison to enzyme in free form and enzyme adsorbed on rGO/FeOOH hydrogel.

Under the optimal conditions, the detection limit (LOD) for Hg2+ was 0.6 fM (S/N = 3). Furthermore, the biosensor could be easily regenerated by cysteine for cyclic utilization. Some environmental samples including lake sediment pore water and tap water were analyzed by the developed biosensor, the relatively satisfactory results indicated that it provided a green and promising strategy for detection of trace Hg2+ in the practical application.",

Culture medium with trona buffer after absorbing CO2(g) contains high dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration that can help maximize the growth and alleviate the inhibition effect as long as the pH of the medium is controlled at an optimum pH (pH ∼7–8) window for the growth of Nannochloris sp. A supply of high purity CO2(g) did not inhibit the growth. The acid gaseous constituents including SO2, NO, and HCl gases did not significantly reduce the growth as compared to the results previously reported. This study suggests that trona buffer can be effectively used for microalgae cultivation as biological CO2 remediation when it is considered being integrated into a coal-fired power plant after wet flue gas desulfurization system.",

Adding 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA) significantly increased the production of 4-AAQB. Since 4-HBA is an intermediate of the shikimate pathway and 4-AAQB and coenzyme Q (CoQ) are similar in structure, we suspected that the pathway for producing 4-AAQB was closely related to the biosynthesis of CoQ. Since the isoprenoid chain of CoQ is synthesized via the mevalonate pathway, we added oleic acid to the culture medium and confirmed that the addition significantly increased the production of 4-AAQB. Furthermore, adding coenzyme Q0 into the fermentation broth was found to be the most effective way to increase the production of 4-AAQB. We suspect that coenzyme Q0 forms CoQ, after which CoQ is converted to 4-AAQB via unknown steps. The increase in 4-AAQB production due to the addition of CoQ10 further demonstrated that the biosynthesis pathway of 4-AAQB from A. cinnamomea is closely related to CoQ.",

     "abstract": "A biocompatible surfactant, methyl ester sulphonate (MES), was evaluated in protein surfactant precipitation. The amount of lysozyme precipitated by MES was found to be a strong function of both the molar ratio of surfactant to protein (Rp), and pH. Precipitation increased proportionally with an increase in Rp up to an optimum of 16, where full precipitation was achieved, while with pH variations electrostatic interactions were found to be the main driver of precipitation. The precipitate was recoverable by solvent extraction (54–56% activity recovery by acetone, ethanol, 50% acetone/ethanol, and methanol), and counter-ionic surfactant, TOMAC (83.3% activity recovery at Rr = 1.5). Importantly, the structural integrity of the lysozyme recovered, either through solvent extraction or counter-ionic surfactant, was maintained, and this was confirmed by CD spectra and deconvolution. Precipitation with MES was compared to a conventional surfactant, AOT; in contrast with AOT, MES did not resolubilise the precipitate or cause structural transformations at higher Rps. MES exhibited better selectivity than AOT since it had minimal hydrophobic interactions in the absence of electrostatic interactions between the surfactant’s anionic group, and the protein’s positively charged groups (pH > pI). Hence, along with its economic benefits, and environmental features, this work has highlighted the potential of using MES in surfactant precipitation.",

Fouling-induced enzyme immobilization in the porous support of an ultrafiltration membrane was used as strategy for entrapment of glucose oxidase and catalase. The biocatalytic productivity of the membrane reactor was found to be highly related to the oxygen availability, which in turn depended on the reactor configuration, hydrogen peroxide concentration and catalase origin. When glucose oxidase and catalase (from Aspergillus niger) were free in the membrane bioreactor a total biocatalytic productivity of 122 mg gluconic acid/mg enzyme was obtained after five consecutive reaction cycles.

In this configuration only 1-butanol partitions significantly between the two phases. With this procedure, it was shown that oleic acid conversion at equilibrium was influenced by the initial mole fraction ratio of reactants, the volume ratio of the organic phase to aqueous phase, as well as the temperature and the nature of the organic solvent. The value of the equilibrium constant of the reaction, which is required for the calculations, was estimated from experiments at 298.15 K and found equal to 78 ± 3.

By using a temperature-shift strategy of cultivation, consisting in preliminary growth at 28 °C followed by 6-day culture at 20 °C, optimal levels of dry cell weight (DCW), lipid content and GLA concentration were obtained from the recombinant strain: 18.55 g/L, 1.16 g/L and 71.6 mg/L, respectively. These DCW, lipid and GLA values were respectively 25.7%, 19.6% and 60.9% higher than those obtained in the control cultivation experiment at the standard constant temperature of 28 °C. This work demonstrates the excellent capacity of Y. lipolytica for GLA production, by combining metabolic engineering with a temperature-shift strategy.",

Final HA concentrations of 3.48 g L−1 were produced in culture medium containing corn steep liquor (10% v/v) and glucose, being comparable (3.60 g L−1) to the control medium containing tryptone and glucose. The use of molasses (10% v/v) as carbon source produced a marked inhibition of S. zooepidemicus growth and HA production due to a low sugar consumption. The HA produced in CSL culture media had a high molecular weight of 3.8 × 103 kDa, greater than HA produced in tryptone-containing medium (3.0 × 103 kDa).This is the first report achieving HA productions comparable to synthetic a medium in a batch bioreactor using CSL as the main nitrogen source.

Therefore, cells from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a biphasic system consisting of an aqueous phase (100 mM phosphate buffer, pH = 7.0) including the co-substrate glucose and heptane as organic phase were used to reduce two β-ketoesters of different polarity. It was found that biocompatibility and extractability in this process have opposed effects and need to be compromised. The cells were immobilized for 5 h using the CPC reactor and the substrate was reduced steadily. The mechanism of immobilization was evaluated visually and traced back to the centrifugal forces as well as the inability of the cells to overcome the liquid–liquid interface.All in all, the CPC reactor for whole cells has conceptual advantages like easy continuous operation, stable catalyst immobilization without the use of a solid phase and in situ product removal, which may open possibilities for the small scale synthesis of fine chemicals using whole cells.",

Various culture parameters were studied and showed that 1/2th strength MS liquid media with 5.0 % (w/v) sucrose, 0.5 mg L−1 IBA, 0.25 mg L−1 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 0.1 mg L−1 Gibberellic Acid (GA3) and an inoculum size of 2 g L−1 was ideal for enhanced biomass combined and CPT yield. The concentration of ammonium to nitrate at 20:40 mM favoured root growth and 50:10 mM favoured CPT accumulation. A significant increase in root growth was observed at 1.25 mM phosphate and CPT accumulation was unaffected. Roots were grown in a modified nutrient medium (MS1) according to the results obtained with the individual culture parameters and obtained significantly high biomass and CPT production. CPT was estimated using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results revealed the effect of major nutrients, growth regulators and inoculum size on growth and CPT production.

In the current study, the availability of CO2 to the cell, as the dissolved CO2 concentration in the fermentation broth ( C CO 2 ), is shown to define three distinct steady-state regimes. At C CO 2 values between 8.4 mM (±36.8% saturation) and saturation (22.8 mM), there is no evidence of CO2 limiting SA productivity and flux to SA is constant. As C CO 2 is decreased, an upper C CO 2 threshold (±36.8% saturation; 8.4 mM) is reached where metabolic flux distributions remain constant but SA productivity and substrate uptake start to decline with decreasing C CO 2 levels. A further decrease in C CO 2 leads to a lower C CO 2 threshold (±17.1% saturation, 3.9 mM) where SA productivity continues to decrease with a concomitant shift in carbon flux away from SA towards C3 fermentative pathways including ethanol. Since SA production is not limited at relatively low C CO 2 values (±36.8% saturation), adequate CO2 supply to the fermenter can be achieved without requiring major CO2 sparging schemes which is favourable from an industrial processing perspective.",

Around 3.7 × 109 t of agricultural residues and 1.3 × 109 t of food residues occur annually worldwide. This enormous amount of organic material is basically considered as waste and incinerated, anaerobically digested or composted for the production of heat, power or fertilizers. However, organic residues can be used as nutrient sources in biotechnological processes. For example, organic residues can be hydrolyzed to glucose, amino acids and phosphate by chemical and/or biological methods, which are utilizable as nutrients by many microbes. This approach paves the way toward the establishment of a bio-based economy and an effective organic residues valorization for the formation of bio-based chemicals and materials. In this review, valorization of organic residues in biotechnological processes is presented. The focus is on the production of three industrially important added value chemicals, namely succinic acid, lactic acid and fatty acid-based plasticizer, which have been used for the synthesis of environmentally benign materials and food supplements. Furthermore, utilization strategies of residues coming from fruit and vegetable processing are introduced.",

The effect of phenolics extraction on the downstream process was evaluated exhibiting no loss of sugars and an increase in the sugar release efficiency during the dilute acid hydrolysis. In order to suggest an economically feasible process, phenolics extraction and dilute acid hydrolysis prior to ethanol fermentation were optimised by means of experimental design. The responses of the designs were not only the efficiencies of the processes, but also a balance between product recovery and estimated costs. In both cases, decreased efficiencies obtained with low liquid-solid ratios were countervailed by increased products concentrations and higher economical performance. Under the optimised conditions, the purity of the phenolics extract (32%) could allow it to enter the market as a dietary supplement of chlorogenic acid, a product with high trade value.

     "abstract": "Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a biodegradable biopolyester with plastic like properties, which on its own or as part of a heteropolymer, finds application in everyday products, competing directly with fossil fuel based plastics in terms of physical and mechanical properties. In nature, PHB is produced as an energy reservoir for the host cell, when environmental conditions limit growth. It is this inherent condition for PHB synthesis (i.e. an environment unsuitable for growth) that challenges design of conventional batch production systems. Balance between growth (driven by nitrogen availability) and PHB production (enhanced by an excess of carbon) is the critical aspect for consideration in such designs. However, selecting the best operating conditions is not obvious for this system and so a systematic approach has been used in this paper, utilising simulations based on a purpose built model to supplement experimental studies.The interaction between the carbon and nitrogen sources (glycerol and ammonium sulphate respectively) was carefully evaluated and incorporated into a low-structured model able to describe the dynamics of substrate consumption and product accumulation during Cupriavidus necator DSM 545 cultivation at small scale. The kinetic parameters thus determined have been assumed to be constant, fixed accordingly, and the model used to predict the fermentation profiles for different operating conditions. Results showed good agreement with experimental data, supporting the efficacy of this approach. The dual utilization of multiple substrates suggests there is a system capacity to which both growth and PHB production contribute and that sets the maximum total biomass concentration. A logistic type term added to both growth and product rate equations enabled the effective decoupling of cell proliferation and PHB accumulation for a wide range of scenarios. In this way, the combination of predictive modelling and experimental verification potentially reduces, by a significant amount, the number of experiments required to establish operational targets such as specific growth rate and productivity as well as identifying often sought criteria such as optimum C:N ratio.",

A review about different approaches related to the modelling and assessment of biorefineries is presented taking into account raw materials, technologies, processing routes, products, and technical, economic and environmental aspects. Methodologies for biorefineries design as conceptual design, optimization and early-stage approaches are studied. Three main concepts are analyzed for the conceptual design of biorefinery systems: hierarchy, sequencing and integration. Finally, the proposed strategy for biorefinery synthesis is applied briefly to two previously cases developed by the authors. A mass index as a new basic concept is applied for understanding the biorefinery efficiency in terms of processing biomass.",

     "abstract": "Systematic methods, such as mathematical programming methods, are traditionally used in decision making concerning capacity planning, especially at tactical and operational level. However, such methods might have the greatest impact at the strategic level where substantial resources are irreversibly allocated. This study proposes a mathematical programming methodology to assist decision makers in strategic (long term) planning for bioprocessing of renewable resources. The novelty lies on the incorporation of significant detail of the bioprocess design in the strategic model and the use of a relatively accurate model for estimating the cost of manufacture of the alternative bioprocesses. A case study demonstrates the advantages of the proposed systematic methodology focusing on optimal screening of 25 bioprocesses for the conversion of molasses, sucrose and glycerol into 11 metabolic products. The methodology was validated via preliminary techno-economic evaluation of the optimum technology-mix involving the production of succinic acid, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) and 2,3-butanediol.",

     "abstract": "The need to achieve a sustainable process performance has become increasingly important in order to keep a competitive advantage in the global markets. Development of comprehensive and systematic methods to accomplish this goal is the subject of this work. To this end, a multi-level framework for techno-economic and environmental sustainability analysis through risk assessment is proposed for the early-stage design and screening of conceptual process alternatives. The alternatives within the design space are analyzed following the framework’s work-flow, which targets the following: (i) quantify the economic risk; (ii) perform the monetary valuation of environmental impact categories under uncertainty; (iii) quantify the potential environmental risk; (iv) measure the alternatives’ eco-efficiency identifying possible trade-offs; and, lastly (v) propose a joint risk assessment matrix for the quantitative and qualitative assessment of sustainability at the decision-support level. Through the application of appropriate methods in a hierarchical manner, this tool leads to the identification of the potentially best and more sustainable solutions. Furthermore, the application of the framework is highlighted by screening two conceptual glycerol bioconversion routes to value-added chemicals namely 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) and succinic acid.",

     "abstract": "Furfural, which is used as a precursor for the production of many other industrial chemicals, has been identified as one of the major bio-based platform chemicals that can compete with petroleum-based chemicals. On the other hand, the current commercial furfural process has a low yield and is energy-intensive. Therefore, this study develops the biorefinery production process of furfural from lignocellulosic biomass using process heat integration and process intensification. In particular, a distillation unit of the furfural production process requires considerable energy, highlighting the need to improve energy efficiency, which is the motivation of this work. An integrated and intensified distillation sequence, including an innovative bottom dividing wall column with a decanter configuration (BDWC-D) was suggested to enhance the energy and cost efficiency of the furfural production process through a comprehensive and systematic procedure that combines process intensification with heat integration. The structures of the complex columns in all sequences were optimized using the optimization method-response surface methodology (RSM). All simulations were conducted using Aspen HYSYS. The results show the proposed sequence can reduce total annual cost and carbon footprint by 10.1% and 11.6%, respectively compared to the conventional sequence.",

Research is focused on increasing fermentation yields and the reduction of energy that is required to separate the volatile products. The paper addresses both of these challenges combining experimental innovations with a systems engineering approach. IBE is recovered from a gas-stripped fermenter whose potential for adsorption is researched and integrated with downstream options for separation. Design and integration is assisted using a systems approach that relies on mathematical models that regress and extrapolate experimental data for scale-up calculations. Process integration involves synthesis challenges to define biorefinery portfolios and systems integration to combine fermentation, stripping, adsorption, and distillation. The analysis considers 4 alternative biorefinery cases and presents results with significant savings in energy use and costs (up to 87% savings reported) after the application of energy integration to the IBE plant.

Unfortunately, viscosity in fibrous slurries is difficult to measure; therefore this work aimed to understand fermenting substrate rheology and to develop a measurement method. A mixing rheometer with a curved impeller was developed to measure the viscosity of fibrous slurries under anaerobic conditions. Using this, the apparent viscosity of fibrous anaerobic-digester content was shown decrease over time (from 5.5–8.5 Pa s to 3.9–6.0 Pa s after 2 h, γ ˙ = 22 s−1). It was confirmed that fibrous anaerobic slurries are shear-thinning fluids that can be described by the power-law, Casson or Bingham models. It was also shown that the shear-thinning behaviour is less pronounced over time. Using two rheoreactors in parallel demonstrated the very large variability in viscosity measurements from a single fibrous sludge, highlighting the need for replicate measurements. A rheoreactor design for measuring the viscosity of fibrous anaerobic sludge and a measurement procedure to take into account the sample variability, as well as changes in viscosity over time and at different shear rates is proposed. This could be used to characterise rheology in many biogas plants, as well as to evaluate the effect of viscosity-reducing treatments.",

Nowadays there is an unprecedented resurgence of interest in separation and purification technology to recovery ABE from fermentation broth. Here we describe a simple salting out procedure for extracting ABE fermentation products efficiently from model solutions/fermentation broth by employing tripotassium phosphate (K3PO4). Increasing the K3PO4 content permits the liquid-liquid splits and enables the recovery of ABE. The liquid-liquid equilibria were mainly determined by the K3PO4 content and slightly affected by temperature and original solvents level. The correlation between the solubility of ABE and the molality of K3PO4 demonstrated this. More than 90 wt% of ABE was recovered from the model solutions/fermentation broth and more than 99.75% of water was removed. This study provides a means to reduce the energy demand of the subsequent distillation process for ABE purification.",

The effect of intermittent mixing on the process was also investigated. Mixing caused a 31% increase in SL production, with a total yield of 0.235 g per g DM. The Oxygen Uptake Rate (OUR) and the Cumulative Oxygen Consumption (COC) were used to monitor the biological activity of the fermentation processes. There were significant correlations between the SL yield and the oxygen and fats consumed. The SLs were characterized by FTIR and 1H NMR analysis.",

The highest β-carotene content (59.91 mg/g dry biomass) and production (2130 mg/l) were obtained as adding 35 mM of NaAC at stationary phase, which were 77.7% and 80.5% increments compared with that of the control, respectively. Furthermore, the effects of NaAC on expression levels of carotenogenesis genes in mated B. trispora were investigated.

Methylotrophic TMAH-degraders were enriched from an anaerobic digester at a municipal wastewater treatment plant, feeding TMAH as a sole substrate. In the system TMAH was converted to methane via methanol whilst trimethylamine, dimethylamine, monomethylamine and ammonium were sequentially produced with the biomass yield of 0.14 gCOD/gTMAH, maximum specific growth rate at 0.372 d⿿1 and specific decay rate at 0.017 d⿿1 under 23 °C.

Defining curvature in terms of pressure addressed these challenges. Using curvature and numerical analysis, the membrane stress in collapsible tanks designed as bioreactors of volumes between 100 to 1000 m3 were calculated. When the liquid/gas height and static pressure are known, an equation for calculating tension per length was developed. An equation that could calculate the liquid height from the bioreactor⿿s volume, dimensions and working capacity was generated. The equation gave values of liquid height with a maximum deviation of 3% from that calculated by curvature analysis.

In this work, DOE was used to compare supplementation with both butyrate and valerate at 31, 34 and 37 °C to enhance recombinant protein productivity in a CHO cell process. Due to the promising results obtained with valerate, this fatty acid was further investigated. According to the results obtained, 1 mM valeric acid at 31 °C enables high cell viabilities, higher product titres and increases cell specific productivity (qp) by approximately 4-fold. Cell cycle analysis showed that at 31 °C, especially with valerate, a higher percentage of cells was in G0 + G1 phase. Overall, an inverse relation between qp and cell proliferation state [S/(G0 + G1) ratio] was observed.

The results provide a promising tool to increase qp under lower proliferation rates, which can be very useful to develop robust high-cell-density, high-productivity perfusion processes.",

An initial screening study was performed to optimize relevant process conditions (enzyme concentration, stirring speed, 1-butanol to oil ratio). A kinetic model was developed based on concentration time profiles. Important reaction parameters were the oil concentration in n-hexane, the enzyme concentration, the 1-butanol to oil molar ratio; the organic to an aqueous solvent volume ratio, the temperature, the pH setting using a phosphate buffer and the agitation rate. The experimental data were modelled using the Ping Pong Bi Bi mechanism with non-competitive inhibition by 1-butanol and a term for irreversible enzyme deactivation during reaction. Agreement between model and experiments was good (R2 = 0.99, average error 4.2%).",

Seed sludge from the aeration tank of a wastewater treatment plant in Singapore was acclimated with synthetic wastewater formulated to contain colloidal (ca. 40%) and dissolved COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand). The COD removal kinetics and the individual mechanisms involved were determined by subjecting the acclimated sludge to increasing organic loadings (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 g COD per g suspended solid) of synthetic wastewater. Under pH 7, sorption capacity of the acclimated sludge increased with organic loading. Comparison between live and azide-inactivated sludge revealed that under organic loading of 1.0 g COD/g SS, a level similar to a typical contact tank for carbon capture, at least 74% of the biosorption capacity was contributed by carbon storage. Kinetics data suggested that carbon storage was the predominant mechanism in the first 20⿿30 min of the carbon capture biosorption process. The removal kinetics of dissolved COD can be represented by a pseudo-second-order model and intraparticle diffusion model. These suggested the rate-limiting steps could include chemisorption and intraparticle diffusion. On the other hand, colloid COD removal can be described as a first order process with respect to initial organic loading. Taxa capable of carbon-storage which include Chloroflexi, Thiobacillus sp., Xanthobacter sp., Mycobacterium sp., and Nakamurella sp., were uniquely detected in the acclimated sludge.",

A 22 factorial design methodology was used to assess the effects of impeller speed (600⿿1000 rpm) and specific air flow rate (0.4⿿1.2 vvm) on the response variables. The EEDP-EEUP, RT-EEDP, and EEDP-RT combinations gave the best results in terms of oxygen transfer (kLa) and power consumption (P), with mass transfer efficiency (EMT = kLa/P) up to 5.09 J⿿1, which was 87% higher than for the RT-RT combination. For the selected impeller combinations (EEDP-EEUP, RT-EEDP, and RT-RT), the shear effects were quantified in terms of average shear rate ( γ ˿ a v ) and using the Kolmogorov microscale (λ). The EEDP-EEUP dual-impeller combination proved to be the best system, with shear conditions (2174 < γ ˿ a v (s⿿1) < 4287) up to 60% lower than for the conventional RT-RT configuration.

Important questions regarding penetrative hyphae remain to be answered: for example, what determines the final length of a penetrative hypha and why do some fungi produce two types of penetrative hyphae, long and short penetrative hyphae? In this work, we develop a discrete model to describe the biomass distribution of penetrative hyphae as a function of depth inside solid particles and apply this model to Rhizopus oligosporus and Aspergillus oryzae, growing in different media. We use our model to suggest different modes of growth and roles for long and short penetrative hyphae: the long ones, also called scouting hyphae, explore the composition of the particle and search for new colonization sites across the particle, while the short hyphae, also called vegetative hyphae, act as anchors for the colony and as enzyme producers. The same factors, namely the firmness of the solid particle and the pressure drop inside the hypha, may determine the final hyphal length of both hyphae. Scouting hyphae may be longer due to a lower pressure drop along the hypha. These hypotheses regarding growth of penetrative hyphae now require experimental investigation.",

Using glycerol feeding with pH control, an effective fermentation process for recombinant CAH production was established in 7.0 L fermenter.

Experiments were performed from 3 Pa up to 6 Pa and samples were allowed to relax for the required equilibration time to avoid the effects of shear history. The response of these tests at the smaller stresses studied (below critical shear stress of 3.6 Pa) was controlled by non-linear viscoelasticity. Subsequently, a slight increase in shear stress above the critical shear stress by just 0.1 Pa resulted in a dramatic change in the creep flow properties.

The complex was prepared by combining P(NIPAAm-co-AAm) with GOD immobilized on Fe3O4@SiO2(F)@meso-SiO2 nanoparticles using in-situ complex method. Since P(NIPAAm-co-AAm) has the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 36 °C, at the temperature above LCST, P(NIPAAm-co-AAm) shrank and PMIGC could not catalyze the oxidation of glucose. At the temperature below LCST, P(NIPAAm-co-AAm) swelled and catalysis occurred. Because of this temperature sensing characteristics of PMIGC, the temperature controllable detection of glucose can be carried out by the biosensor. The optimal detection conditions for this biosensor were achieved with pH6.5, 35 °C and 12 mg of GOD amount. At 25 °C, a good linear relationship between Ͽ, the phase delay change of the sensor head, and the glucose concentration in the range of 50⿿700 mg/dL (2.78⿿38.89 mmol/L) was observed, the detection limit was 8.33 mg/dL (0.46 mmol/L) (S/N = 3). This linear graph can be defined by the equation of y = 0.01463 + 0.0003313x, R2 = 0.9914. The biosensor has the characteristics of good repeatability and selectivity, and can be used for the glucose detection in practical samples.",

Five endoxylanases from different glycoside hydrolase families and microorganisms were tested with an arabinofuranosidase, Araf51A, for the hydrolysis of insoluble wheat arabinoxylan, which is a structural component of hemicellulose. The optimized combination was XynZ/Xyn11A/Araf51A with a loading ratio of 2:2:1, and the value of degree of synergy increased with the increase of Araf51A proportion in the enzyme mixture. Afterwards, selected enzymes were immobilized on commercial magnetic nanoparticles through covalent bonding. Both free and immobilized enzymes showed a similar conversion to reducing sugars after hydrolysis for 48 h. After 10 cycles, approximately 20% of the initial enzymatic activity of both the individual or mixture of immobilized enzymes was retained. A 5.5-fold increase in the production of sugars was obtained with a mixture of enzymes immobilized after 10 cycles in total compared with free enzymes. Importantly, a sustainable synergism between immobilized arabinofuranosidase and immobilized endoxylanases in the hydrolysis of arabinoxylan was demonstrated.",

Polymer grafting provided a three-dimensional regular arrangement of the ligand and increased ionic capacity of the poly(SPM)-grafted cation-exchangers. The result showed that adsorption capacity for lysozyme enhanced greatly in poly(SPM)-grafted cation-exchangers whereas adsorption capacity for γ-globulin decreased dramatically. It can be attributed to the consequence of the competition between electrostatic interaction and repulsive excluded volume interaction of grafted polymer and protein. For lysozyme, protein adsorption on poly(SPM)-grafted cation exchangers was driven dominantly by electrostatic interaction. By constrast, the repulsive excluded volume interaction between grafted polymer and protein was remarkable in adsorption of γ-globulin on poly(SPM)-grafted cation exchangers. Moreover, the poly(SPM)-grafted cation exchangers exhibited great salt tolerance in protein adsorption and distinct intraparticle mass transfer properties. Finally, the results of dynamic binding capacity (DBC) for lysozyme showed that the poly(SPM)-grafted cation-exchangers had higher binding capacities than did the commercial SP Sepharose FF, and the maximal DBCs reached 192 mg/mL at 50 mmol/L NaCl.

This study is aimed at determining these parameters to identify through a regime analysis the mechanisms limiting the bioconversion process. The volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (kLa) and the Sauter mean drop diameter (d32) values ranged from 10 to 116 h−1 and 8 to 18 μm, respectively. The substrate (kS) and product (kP) global interfacial mass transfer coefficients were determined from a modified Lewis cell.

Thus, in this study, an optimal light feeding strategy coupled with a semi-continuous reactor operation was developed for achieving the above-mentioned goals. At a light intensity of 260 μmol m−2 s−1 as optimized in batch mode, baseline lutein productivity of 4.32 mg L−1 d−1 was obtained, when culturing Chlorella minutissima under optimal process conditions. On switching over to incremental illumination modes, the linear light-feeding (Strategy-III) resulted in higher lutein productivity of 5.35 mg L−1 d−1 with photosynthetic efficiency of 8.38%. When Strategy-III was integrated with semi-continuous mode involving 20% medium replenishment, lutein productivity, photosynthetic efficiency and CO2 sequestration rate were further enhanced by 19%, 41% and 34% respectively. Moreover, on this process optimization and integration, light-energy consumption was significantly reduced by 32%, in comparison with constant-illumination. Thus, this optimal production strategy resulted in significantly higher lutein productivity, content and photosynthetic efficiency, as compared to the relevant studies reported in literature.",

We showed that the expressed RABV-G was recognized by rabies virus neutralizing antibodies; nevertheless the secretion level remained low; being around 128 ng/mL.

The first case study involves the hydrolysis of maltoheptaose by a β-amylase and shows that the fingerprinting method can be applied to schemes involving processivity. The analysis reveals that the native β-amylase has a 1.26-fold preference for attacking maltoheptaose by the processive route over the non-processive route, but that for a mutant enzyme this preference is 0.18-fold. The second case study involves the hydrolysis of β-1,6-N-acetylglucosamine oligomers by DispersinB. Our set of relative specificity constants is more consistent with the results of initial rate experiments than is the set that the authors obtained by fitting a pseudo-first order model to their data. The third case study involves the hydrolysis of galacturonic acid oligomers by an endopolygalacturonase. This enzyme can catalyze a total of 11 different reactions with a mixture of tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa- and heptagalacturonates. We determined the relative specificity constants for these 11 reactions. The fingerprinting method has advantages over the methods that have been previously used to determine specificity constants for branched reaction schemes, being able to use a single experimental reaction profile for determination of all relative specificity constants.",

As the lysozyme content increased from 0 to 2.5% (w/w), the tensile strength of the coating enhanced by 37% (1.1 MPa vs 0.8 MPa), and the contact angle increased by 10% (73.1° vs 80.6°). Those changes are possibly due to enhancement of crosslinking degree and hydrogen bonding induced by modified lysozyme. Based on live/dead staining and colonies number assay, the coatings containing lysozyme (2.5%, w/w) were highly efficient in killing Staphylococcus aureus (91.3%) and Escherichia coil (62.9%) via degradation of cell wall within 2 h, and the colonies number for both strains was significantly decreased to less than 1% after incubation for 24 h. In addition, the killing efficiency of the coatings remained 68.3% after six continuous uses. Such UV-curable waterborne polyurethane coatings containing lysozyme (UWPU-L) may be useful in anti-bacterial stains on various common surfaces in hospital settings and food packaging.",

To date, however, its feasibility has never been evaluated by any full-scale investigation. Here we report a first full-scale (180 m3/day) evaluation of the AEI process and its integration with intermittent sand filter to treat highway rest area sewage that is often neglected but actually brings significant impacts on receiving water bodies in China. The results showed that 70–99% of influent phosphate was removed in the AEI zone, although the sewage contained 23–37% of carbohydrate that is usually considered to be detrimental for BPR. Batch experimental investigation revealed that the presence of glucose (model compound of carbohydrate) promoted the AEI-inducing BPR efficiency, as opposed to deteriorating the conventional anaerobic/oxic regime-inducing BPR performance. Although the performance of AEI zone was affected by seasonal variation, the efficiencies of contaminant removal were stable and excellent (total nitrogen > 86%, others > 92%) in the integrated system. This study offers an attractive option for BPR from carbohydrate-rich wastewaters and also provides a prototype for wastewater treatment in remote areas.",

With the increase of OLR, there were inhibitions existing in the anaerobic digester which showed up in the increase of concentration of H2 and H2S.

The efficiency and stability, which are affected by the permeability and forces on granule surface, are both crucial to its full scale application. In this work, the structural and hydrodynamic characteristics of the granules were investigated using experimental approach and numerical simulations. Aerobic granule was considered to be a porosity sphere composed of smaller particles. Mixture model in FLUENT was used for gas-liquid two-phase flow simulation, and the phase resistance was calculated using schiller-naumann function. The influence of gas holdup and granule size on the surface force was simulated and the results show that the shear stress increases with the gas holdup, while the granule size has little effect on the surface force. Using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical model, it was demonstrated that the convection path lines for the granules colored by the velocity magnitude increase with the Reynolds number and the primary particle diameter. The model also indicated that improving the permeability of a granule can reduce the total pressure on the granule surface, but it has less effect on the strain rate. In addition, a new simulation was developed to evaluate the fluid collection efficiency, which proved to be in good agreement with the results determined by formulas and experiments.",

In addition to high product titer, cell numbers and product quality, the composition and concentration of host cell proteins were taken into account. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated within this work. A model CHO cell line producing IgG was used to develop a medium, which generates higher titers and cell numbers as well as a lower amount of HCP. The new composition of HCP was designed to simplify subsequent purification steps. Experiments were statistically planned and the results were validated, all resulting in higher product titers but lower HCP levels.In the next step, the influence of the cultivation and cell harvest operations on the impurities was investigated. Centrifugation, filtration and aqueous two phase extraction were evaluated regarding their ability to separate cells and HCP without product loss. ATPE distinguished itself as the cell harvest operation of choice by high cell separation efficiency, high yields, and a substantial removal of HCP which could not be met by centrifugation and filtration.",

The objective of this article is to develop a kinetic model of the microbial production of sodium gluconate by using generalized stoichiometric equations and a typical enzyme kinetic structure called power series to overcome the shortcomings of previous methods.The proposed kinetic model can describe the microbial growth of fungus as well as the interaction among dissolved oxygen, fungal metabolism, and product formation. Six batches were selected from seven batches of experimental sample data for modeling and analysis. The fitting precision was acceptable. The key parameters were analyzed based on the model.

This study aimed to maximize the loading of glucose oxidase (GOx) on the surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), thereby enhancing the generation of electric power or sensing signals. Because the concentrations of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), and glucose oxidase significantly affected the immobilization efficiency, these factors were optimized by the Box–Behnken design. The physically adsorbed enzyme was almost completely removed by washing the GOx-bound MWCNTs with buffer solution containing 5 g/L of Tween-20. Enzyme loading was found to be ∼3.3 ± 0.3 mg-GOx/mg-MWCNTs under the optimal conditions (430 mM NHS, 52 mM EDC and 8.7 mg/mL GOx). The formation of carboxyl group on the surface of MWCNTs and the covalent bonding between GOx and MWCNTs, and immobilized GOx were observed by FTIR and AFM, respectively. The biochemical analysis showed that the immobilized GOx possesses high activity for the conversion of glucose into gluconic acid. The cyclic voltammetry data showed that the anodic current density of electrodes loaded with the highest amount of GOx was much higher than those of electrodes loaded with smaller amounts of GOx.",

In this study, PQQ overproduction in G. oxydans was attempted by overexpressing PQQ biosynthetic genes using the promoter of pqqA and the elongation factor TU (tufB).

     "abstract": "Spirulina platensis can mitigate CO2 emissions and simultaneously produce an antioxidant called C-phycocyanin (C-PC), which is a high value nutraceutical product. An innovative pH control system was used to cultivate S. platensis, in which CO2 feeding, instead of acid/alkaline titration, was used to control the pH of the culture. The optimum culture pH was 9.5. Compared to continuous CO2 feeding system, the pH control system improved the CO2 removal efficiency from 13.6% to 62.3%. The C-PC content and productivity were also enhanced to 16.8% and 0.17 g/L/d, respectively. Therefore, the proposed pH control system is economic and sustainable as it avoids the use of acid/alkaline and reduces the overall CO2 emissions. A two-stage C-PC purification process combining fractional precipitation and ion exchange chromatography could achieve the highest purity (A615/A280) of 4.33 with a 33% C-PC recovery.",

The metabolic activity of microorganisms, which is strongly dependent on environmental parameters, may also be affected by stressful conditions. The influence of pre-incubation of the fungus Chrysosporium pannorum in different stress conditions (organic solvents, medium pH and temperatures) on its activity in the oxidative bioconversion of α-pinene to verbenone and verbenol was examined. The total bioconversion activity increased over 2-fold after 15-min pre-treatment with 1.4-dioxane as an abiotic stress factor. Also, the change of the medium pH from the optimal 5.6 to 2.0 and 10 for 1 h before biotransformation enhanced product yield nearly 1.5-fold. Moreover, the use of dioxane, chloroform and ethanol and thermal stress at 50 °C caused changes in the oxidation product profile (predominance of trans-pinocarveol over trans-verbenol). A maximum increase in the yield of verbenol was observed when the biocatalyst was subjected to 15-min dioxane stress before 24-h biotransformation of 1% (v/v) pinene. The significance of the data presented is that abiotic stresses may improve the bioconversion activity or create changes in the proportion of the main biotransformation products.",

A simple model to describe highly-loaded aerobic COD removal reactors has been developed. A one-year-set of measured data from a full scale wastewater treatment plant has been used to calibrate the efficiency of the adsorption and to evaluate the ability of the mathematical model to describe the measured data in both steady state and dynamic conditions. The approach lumped the efficiency of the settler and the adsorption with a simple but powerful approach which includes the use of the measured sludge retention time (SRT) and the settling efficiency. The effects of dynamics in terms of (i) seasonality (for water temperature, flow rate and concentration of pollutants), and (ii) daily variations in flow rate were investigated. Results showed how during winter the low water temperatures negatively impacted the efficiency of the A-stage, producing a higher COD concentration in the effluent, which eventually could impact the performance of the nitrogen removal in the B-stage. General guidelines for the application of the model to similar highly loaded A-stage reactor systems were provided.",

The influence of salinity variation on N2O emission was analyzed by gradually increasing the inlet salt concentration from 0 to 10 g NaCl L−1.The observed results showed that the N2O concentration of the gaseous samples was strongly influenced by the salt concentration. This result was likely related to a worsening of the nitrification activity due to the effect of salinity on autotrophic bacteria. Dissolved oxygen concentration and salinity were found to be the key factors affecting N2O concentration in the gaseous samples withdrawn from the anoxic tank. Despite the fact that the N2O concentration in the anoxic tank was higher than in the aerobic one, it was found that the aerobic tank emitted around 25 times more N2O than the anoxic one.",

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the P(3HB-co-3HV) production from Cupriavidus necator in a repeated fed-batch system with external cell recycle, maintaining a controlled residual cell growth during the production phase by nitrogen feeding strategy. The glucose, at the feeding culture medium, simulated the carbon concentration usually found in agro-industrial wastes. Two cultures were performed: one conducted with nitrogen exhaustion and another with nitrogen feeding in limited concentrations, during the production phase. Propionic acid was added to allow 3HV production. In both cultures 73 % of P(3HB-co-3HV) was produced, but at the culture with nitrogen feeding, during the production phase, productivity reached 1.24 gP(3HB-co-3HV).L−1.h−1 and qP(3HB-co-3HV) remain at the maximum level (0.13 gP(3HB-co-3HV).gXr−1.h−1) during more time. The 3HV percentage was similar at the end of both cultures.

GC–MS was used to have a comparative characterization for chemical composition changes of aromatic groups (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), sulfur-containing heterocycles (SCHs) or polycyclic aromatic sulfur heterocycles (PASHs), and aromatic biomarkers) during different remediation processes. Bioaugmentation had faster startup (higher total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) removal efficiency on Day 30) while phytoremediation had higher TPH removal efficiency at the end of experiments (90 days). The 90-day TPH removal efficiency of phytoremediation (64.0 ± 1.6%) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of bioaugmentation (54.6 ± 1.3%) which was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of natural attenuation (20.7 ± 2.8%). GC–MS analysis shows that the removal efficiencies of most of individual PAH and SCH compounds by phytoremediation were also significantly higher (p < 0.05) than bioaugmentation which were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than natural attenuation. GC–MS analysis also shows that the removal efficiencies of individual PAH and SCH compounds for all three treatments (phytoremediation, bioaugmentation, and natural attenuation) decreased with increases in ring number and degree of alkyl substitution. Overall, this study shows that phytoremediation with T. arundinacea and bioaugmentation with a halotolerant microbial consortium are two effective approaches for remediating saline soil contaminated by heavy crude oil.",

Overfeeding should be avoided because even slightly higher concentrations may result in an inhibition or even poisoning of the microbial culture when toxic substrates are used. Therefore, bioprocess monitoring and control play a key role. This paper introduces a new bioprocess state classification methodology combining expert knowledge and automatic signal analysis, suitable for on-line application. A fed-batch cultivation of the strain Pseudomonas putida KT2442 grown on octanoic acid was used as a model process. The classification was performed in two steps – a manual classification done by an expert, and a subsequent automatic classification using the results obtained by the manual classification. The manual classification strategy was based on the analysis of time profiles of selected process variables related to substrate feeding, such as dissolved oxygen tension and substrate feeding rate. Three process states were recognized – normal feeding, overfeeding and underfeeding. Ridge regression was then applied to the data results of the manual classification in order to design an automatic classification strategy for easier on-line use. This strategy can distinguish between the normal and other feeding states, using a limited number of on-line measurable output variables and their time fluctuations.",

Ethanol is produced first followed by the growth of oleaginous yeast employing the residual carbon and nitrogen left from the first step. Two yeasts were compared for ethanol production. Trichosporon oleaginosus was cultivated for lipid production. The yeast selection for the first step was the most important factor for achieving a high ethanol yield and the effect of inorganic nitrogen addition was not significant. The remaining sugars consisted of a mixture of sucrose and fructose and no residual glucose was detected in any of the runs. In the second step T. oleaginosus DSM 11815 grew in the pooled juices remaining from the first step for 168 h and produced biomass with 28% lipid content. Glucose showed the highest uptake rate, sucrose was utilized until low glucose values prevailed, and fructose was slowly metabolized and a substantial amount remained. Although the two step process has flexibility in choosing the proper microorganism for each step, it is necessary to look for a rapid fructose uptake strain for both fermentations.",

In the UASB operation, the highest OLR handled was 6 kg COD/m3/d, in which the attained biogas production rate, phenol degradation, and CH4 contents were 2.1 m3/m3/d, 79.0%, and 75.3%, respectively. Syntrophorhabdus and Clostridium were found to be the dominant bacteria, whose sum occupied around 60% of total bacterial sequences. In particular, there was a significant increase in Syntrophorhabdus (39.2% of total bacterial sequences), known to degrade phenol to benzoate and subsequently to acetate and hydrogen in syntrophic association with a hydrogenotrophic methanogen. In terms of archaea, Methanosaeta (42.1% of total archaeal sequences), and Methanobacterium (24.5% of total archaeal sequences) became dominant as operation continued, which were negligible in the inoculum.",

However, glycerol anaerobic digestion effluent (ADE) consists of carboxylic acids and 1,3-PDO, imposing difficulties for separation. The objective of this study was, therefore, to investigate microbial removal of carboxylic acids from 1,3-PDO in glycerol ADE by polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) producing consortium. Growth tests on carbon sources showed Corynebacterium hydrocarbooxydans had preference for butyrate while Bacillus megaterium for acetate and glycerol. Consequently, their consortium had a higher cell density and a faster substrate utilization rate than single strain grown in glycerol ADE. Acidic pH at 6.0 and 5.2 strongly inhibited cell growth and activity, while C:N ratio (w/w) at 8:1 could balance nitrogen demand for cell growth and PHA synthesis. Kinetic study further revealed over 80% of fed 1,3-PDO was preserved after depletion of carboxylic acids. Correspondingly, total organic carbon (TOC) contribution from 1,3-PDO rose from initial 55.8% to 84%. Produced PHAs comprised 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) units. The results showed this study as the first attempt to provide a win-win solution to remove carboxylic acids from 1,3-PDO in glycerol ADE and converted them into PHAs as a secondary value-added product.",

However, the primary mechanism for accelerating the decomposition of complex substrates contained in WAS remains unclear as so far. In this study anaerobic sludge digestion operated in a single-chamber methane-production MEC was investigated. It was found that the decomposition rate of proteins and carbohydrates were significantly accelerated in MEC, which resulted in the improvement of methane production as compared with the common anaerobic sludge digester. The energy income from the increased methane production was equivalent to 13.4 times as more as the electric energy supply. Further bacterial community analysis showed that anaerobic fermentative bacteria were largely enriched in MEC especially its anodic biofilm. Together with anodic exoelectrogenic bacteria (mainly Geobacter species) accounting for the dominant part of bacterial community in the anodic biofilm, it was suggested that the potential for syntrophic interaction between anaerobic fermentative bacteria and anodic exoelectrogenic bacteria enriched might be the important reason for accelerating the decomposition of complex substrates contained in WAS, which further resulted in the high-efficiency methane production as well as energy recovery.",

Solid-state fermentation has the potential to produce low-cost pectinases for such biorefineries, but it is difficult to control the process at large scales. In the current work, Aspergillus oryzae was cultivated in a pilot-scale packed-bed bioreactor, on 15 kg of a substrate containing 51.6% citrus pulp and 48.4% sugarcane bagasse (w/w, dry basis). The sugarcane bagasse gave a high bed porosity and ensured a stable bed structure, avoiding problems of bed shrinkage and the formation of compact agglomerates within the bed. As a result, bed temperatures were controlled to within 1 °C of the inlet air temperature and pectinase yields of 33–41 U g−1 were obtained across the bed. When the fermented solids were dried and added directly to a pectin solution, they gave a profile for the release of d-galacturonic acid similar to that obtained with a commercial pectinase.

As an efficient approach for solving these biochemical dynamic optimization problems, control vector parameterization encounters the difficulty of selecting an optimal discretization level which balances the computational cost with the desired solution quality to obtain high accuracy solution. To tackle this issue, a new slope analysis is proposed to analyze the control variables and discretization time grid, results find that low slope time grid nodes have less effect on the improvement of performance index and can be regarded as unnecessary nodes, while high ones are important time points. Based on this, a novel non-uniform adaptive grid refinement control parameterization approach is therefore presented, where the slope analysis is applied to refine or to coarsen the time grid so as to obtain a suitable discretization level with a small number of control intervals. By application in three well-known biochemical optimization problems, results show that the proposed method is able to achieve similar or even better performance indexes with small numbers of control intervals and lower computational costs.",

The effects of changes in the enzyme surface and changes of the support particles size, on substrates mass transfer restrictions were studied on the alcoholysis of Camelina oil in the presence or not of t-butanol as co-solvent.Significant changes of the support particle size were detected after their chemical modification. The particle size of Lewatit VP OC 1600 support of Novozym® 435 diminished in solvent-free systems. Alcoholysis rates in t-butanol media were enhanced caused by two favorable effects of this solvent: substrates dissolution and support swelling. This latter effect was not sufficient to promote protein desorption during processing. The hydrophobic environment created by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzensulfonic acid (TNBS) derivatization favoured the oil conversion. The TNBS derivative was also more stable than Novozym® 435 in methanolysis with solvent.Scanning electron microscopy revealed that after 14 reaction cycles of 24 h, a large proportion of biocatalyst particles were broken; however, matrix rupture did not cause biocatalysts inactivation.

After the validation step, this model was used as a predictive tool to search for optimal dilution rate and C/N ratios for continuous culture. A continuous culture was then launched using these culture parameters, revealing that the experimental data fitted the model predictions.

     "abstract": "The enzymatic delignification of lignocellulosic biomass for separation of cellulose, Earth’s most abundant biopolymer, has been generally acknowledged as an environmentally friendly process. However, this approach for lignin degradation has been found to be very slow due to the difficulties in enzyme accessibility to the solid substrate. To address this issue, this paper reports a delignification process of oil palm frond biomass (OPFB) that combined an ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment (dissolution and recovery of treated OPFB by anti-solvent), followed by enzymatic delignification. The pretreatment of biomass was conducted using a hydrophilic IL [EMIM][DEP] (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium diethyl phosphate), which possesses very high solubility for lignocellulosic biomass. Pretreated and untreated materials were characterized by scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and chemical methods. IL pretreatment significantly enhanced the rate of enzymatic delignification of OPFB. The lignin content of produced materials was about 8.5 wt%, much lower than 24.0 wt% lignin content of untreated OPFB materials. Obtained cellulose-rich OPFB fibers exhibited higher thermal stability compared to untreated OPFB, possibly due to removal of lignin. These results indicate that IL pretreatment may provide unique advantages to separation of cellulose rich OPFB fibers for composite, textile and other industrial applications.",

Cascade process of HFRLM was carried out to recover penicillin G from the aqueous solution using di-n-octylamine in iso-octanol and kerosene as the liquid membrane phase and K2CO3 aqueous solution as the stripping phase. The mass transfer performance of the process was evaluated in a hollow fiber module with 1000 microporous and hydrophobic polypropylene (PP) hollow fibers. The cascade process of HFRLM was feasible for penicillin G recovery and the enrichment factor, extraction and recovery efficiency were larger than that of single-stage process. The stripping phase of 0.5 mol L−1 K2CO3 solution could not only keep the efficiency of re-extraction, but also ensure the stability of penicillin G. Besides, the results indicated that 0.2 mol L−1 potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution as the buffer solution in the feed solution could greatly reduce the loss of penicillin G due to the pH fluctuation. In the cascade mode operated at the flow rates of 45 mL min−1 in the shell side and 20 mL min−1 in the tube side, the extraction and recovery efficiency of 97% and 82% for penicillin G were achieved after 7 stages respectively.

The flow patterns of the SSSAB under super-high (hydraulic loading rate L = 18.45 L L−1 d−1, biogas production rate G = 80.24 L L−1 d−1) and high loadings (L = 9.23 L L−1 d−1, G = 40.12 L L−1 d−1) tended to the completely mixed flow, while under middle (L = 4.61 L L−1 d−1, G = 20.06 L L−1 d−1) and low loadings (L = 2.31 L L−1 d−1, G = 10.03 L L−1 d−1) tended to the plug-flow.

Experiments were also performed at controlled dissolved oxygen (DO) and citric acid concentration increased with DO up to 60% of saturation. Thus, due to the simpler operation setting an optimal kLa than at controlled DO, it can be concluded that kLa is an adequate parameter for the optimization of citric acid production from crude glycerol by Y. lipolytica and to be considered in bioprocess scale-up.

So far, accurate diagnosis is still a problem, especially in endemic areas and in the tracking and screening of asymptomatic dogs, which are good reservoirs and main host in urban areas. Recombinant antigens based on DNA technology have provided more reliable serological diagnostics since the specificity can be achieved easier than using whole extracts. This work reports a sensitive piezeolectric immunosensor for anti-Leishamnia antibodies based on rLci2B recombinant antigens immobilized on quartz crystal electrode. The electrode surface was assembled by a nafion film recovered by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to promote a greater amount of rLci2B due to the increase of surface area and stability on bonds. The immunosensor distinguished the positive VL canine serum showing a good linearity (r = 0.989; p < < 0.01) and a low relative error (<5%) at 1:400 to 1:1600 serum dilutions. The system based on AuNP achieved better results regarding sensitivity and reproducibility than the cysteamine-based immunosensor without AuNP (r = 0.769; p = 0.147).

     "abstract": "Kinetic modeling is a key aspect of systems biology with biotechnological applications. However, a limitation of building kinetic models of metabolism (particularly from stoichiometric reconstructions of metabolic networks) is that they often ignore the allosteric regulators. This can cause discrepancies in the model predictions. In this paper, we derived an approximated lin-log ODE model of the Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism, with and without metabolite-enzyme regulators. Next, we analyzed the influence of incorporating this level of metabolite-enzyme interactions in the metabolic network by performing several in silico single-gene knockouts and enzyme under-/over-expression changes. Through comparing these model predictions with those generated with a reference mechanistic kinetic model for E. coli, it is shown that including of allosteric regulation affects the flux control patterns over serine production and reveals more details of the model behavior in a general sense. The present work demonstrates that the regulatory (allosteric) structure in metabolic networks plays an essential role to further improve kinetic model prediction capabilities. The incorporation of allosteric regulation interactions in building a kinetic model can lead to different hypotheses in order to suggest enzyme targets for strain design through metabolic engineering.",

The tests comprehended lactose hydrolysis followed by glucose-galactose anaerobic fermentation in a batch system. A CCRD was proposed to evaluate the following factors: concentration of hydrolyzed CWP, and N, Mg and K supplementation, where the system response was considered to be cell growth. The cultivation media NLP model was empirically determined by a statistical methodology, and was also based on the elemental composition and the stoichiometry of the yeast anaerobic cultivation. The kinetic mathematical model of the yeast cultivation was proposed, where inhibition by the substrates of fast-glucose and slow-galactose metabolization, inhibition by the product ethanol, catabolite repression by glucose, and metabolic products formation were adequately considered. In addition, the response surface provided by the kinetic modeling was also analyzed.

Results showed that foaming stimulated surfactin production, resulting in 1.13-fold higher surfactin producing abilities (17 mg/g h) and higher biomass yields (∼0.27 g/g) in comparison to fermentation performances achieved by using cells not subjected to foaming.

Second, continuous foam fractionation experiments enabled controlled segregation of cells by foaming. This revealed that foamed cells displayed 2-fold higher specific surfactin production rates (16 mg/g h) than non-foamed cells (8 mg/g h). Furthermore, cell growth, surfactin titers, and volumetric productivities were further enhanced by re-using spent B. subtilis cells from the column overflow.

Furthermore, the impact of the selected extract on the oxidative stability of biodiesel, measured as peroxide, P-anisidine and totox value, was evaluated using biodiesel samples contaminated with 1000 and 2000 ppm of Fe3+, Cu2+ and Al3+ and stored for different periods (0, 4, 8 and 12 days).The highest total phenolic contents 46.50 mg GAL/g dry weight (DW), total flavonoids (16.06 mg catechin/g DW), DPPH radical scavenging activity (87.69%) and reducing power activity (2.90, absorbance value) were recorded for aqueous ethanol (ethanol:water, 80:20 v/v) extract. The peroxide values of biodiesel samples subjected to 1000 and 2000 ppm of Fe3+, Cu2+ and Al3+ contamination at the end of the storage period (12 day) were about (1.45;1.96), (1.27;1.61) and (1.21;1.52) times as high as in control sample without additives, respectively. Biodiesel samples subjected to 2000 ppm of Cu2+ and Fe3+ had the highest values of p-AV (17.89 and 16.37) and Totox (92.98 and 85.23) at the end of the storage period, respectively. Addition of LCL extract at level of 800 ppm caused decreases in the formation of peroxide ranged from 53.48 to 66.00%, in the formation of secondary oxidation products from 47.58 to 69.64% and in Totox values varied from 54.56 to 66.25% compared to those samples subjected to metal contamination without antioxidant.",

Results showed that the gas stripping technique was effective since ethanol concentration was maintained below threshold of toxicity (no more than 60 g/L in all cases), as well as sugar containing was consumed almost completely. Furthermore, a mixed mathematical model combining a complex term for the ethanol entrainment from gas stripping fermentation was proposed based in robust models for sugarcane molasses previously presented in literature. Parameters Y p x , μ max , P max , Y x , X max were estimated and presented itself within previous ranges validated for sugarcane molasses.

     "abstract": "Ionic liquids (ILs) have been increasingly exploited as solvents and/or reagents in many applications due to their “green” properties as well as their tunable physicochemical and biological properties. One of them is the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass prior to enzymatic hydrolysis for bioenergy and biomaterials production. Generally, the process composed of an IL pretreatment/recovered followed by enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. Another approach was developed in which simultaneous pretreatment and saccharification of biomass in ILs were performed. However, the use of ILs in this integrated process, in which enzymatic hydrolysis is done in the presence of IL applied for biomass pretreatment, can easily inactivate the enzymes. Cellulases, one of the most important hydrolytic enzymes used to catalyze the polysaccharide, showed good levels of stability in many ILs. In addition, various approaches were made including synthesis of enzyme-compatible ILs, screening ILs-tolerant enzymes and media engineering to improve cellulases performance. In this review paper, recent advances of the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass in a single-step process in ILs will be highlighted. Various cellulase stabilization approaches and the design of enzyme compatible biomass-dissolving ILs are also discussed. We strongly believe that IL-compatible cellulase systems would eliminate the need to recover the regenerated biomass and lead to a simple, in situ saccharification of cellulosic materials, which would be beneficial in developing integrated bioprocesses.",

Phycobiliproteins have high potential pharmaceutical and biological properties but their application is confronted with two major obstacles: (i) the upstream and downstream processes still have some hindrances such as selection of suitable microalgae strains, bioreactor design, culture conditions, etc.; (ii) the purification of phycobiliproteins from microalgae is still low. Biosynthesis of higher purity phycobiliproteins from microalgae is a multiple concomitant steps for which the main criteria and factors were discussed in this paper.

     "abstract": "The ability to incorporate non-natural amino acids during protein biosynthesis has greatly broadened the amino acid sequence space available for protein engineering. The increasing number of non-natural amino acids provides novel sidechain chemistries, structures, and functionalities for engineered proteins including enzymes. Therefore, understanding how non-natural amino acid incorporation (non-natural amino acid mutagenesis) affects protein function is crucial. This study investigates the positional effects of hydrophobic non-natural amino acid mutagenesis of the enzyme surface on the enzyme structure and function with the ultimate goal of identification of permissive sites for non-natural amino acid mutagenesis. A bulky, hydrophobic non-natural amino acid, 3-(2-naphthyl)-alanine (2Nal), was site-specifically incorporated at the solvent-exposed surface of a murine dihydrofolate reductase (mDHFR) enzyme. Incorporation of 2Nal was performed at six solvent-exposed sites (V43, E44, F142, E143, F179, and E180), generating six mDHFR variants. Incorporation of 2Nal into F142 or F179 did not exhibit any substantial change in the secondary structure and catalytic activities, whereas 2Nal incorporation at hydrophilic Glu sites significantly changed the secondary structure and catalytic activities. Such different responses upon 2Nal incorporation at hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues were likely due to the structural changes caused by the hydrophobicity change upon mutation. A non-conservative mutation of V43 with 2Nal significantly reduced the catalytic activities suggesting that a substantial size change of sidechain also causes the structural changes. These results suggest that even hydrophobic, bulky non-natural amino acids can be incorporated at the enzyme surface without compromising the enzymatic activities.",

Grinding the orange peel (2.5 glimonene L−1) did not influence the BMP values, but slowed the kinetics, due to the increased availability of CEO caused by the grinding.The effect of (R)-limonene (0–3000 mg L−1) on the batch anaerobic digestion of microcrystalline cellulose was also assessed. The half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50, was 423 mg kg−1 in an initial run and 669 mg kg−1 in a second run of batch experiments. The methane course and IC50 values indicate that there are reversible inhibition and biomass activity recovery during the anaerobic digestion process, despite the non-reversible antimicrobial mechanism described in the literature for limonene to date.",

     "abstract": "Carboxylic acid reductases (CARs) have been harnessed in metabolic pathways to produce aldehydes in engineered organisms. However, desired aldehyde products inhibit cell growth and limit product titers currently achievable from fermentative processes. Aldehyde toxicity can be entirely circumvented by performing aldehyde biosynthesis in non-cellular systems. Use of purified CARs for preparative-scale aldehyde synthesis has been limited by in vitro turnover of model CARs, such as CarNi from Nocardia iowensis, despite robust conversion of substrates associated with expression in heterologous hosts such as E. coli and yeast. In this study, we report that in vitro activity of CarNi is inhibited by formation of the co-product pyrophosphate, and that pairing of an inorganic pyrophosphatase (PpaEc) with CarNi substantially improves the rate and yield of aldehyde biosynthesis. We demonstrate that, in the presence of PpaEc, Michaelis–Menten kinetic models based on initial rate measurements accurately predict CarNi kinetics within an in vitro pathway over longer timescales. We rationalize our novel observations for CarNi by examining previously posed arguments for pyrophosphate hydrolysis made in the context of other adenylate-forming enzymes. Overall, our findings may aid in increasing adoption of CARs for cell-free in vitro aldehyde biosynthetic processes.",

In this study, two thermostable enzymes including an AI from Lactobacillus fermentum CGMCC2921 and a β-galactosidase from Thermus thermophilus HB27 were co-expressed in Escherichia coli. The order of the two genes, the downstream Shine–Dalgarno (SD) sequence and the aligned spacing (AS) length were optimized to balance their expression levels. One recombinant E. coli strain showed balanced activities for the two enzymes using GAAGGAGA as the downstream SD sequence and 10 nucleotides (nt) for AS. During whole cell bio-catalysis, the recombinant E. coli cells showed optimal catalytic temperature and pH at 70 °C and 7.0, respectively.

The experimental results indicated that the effects of ILs on the casein hydrolysis depended on their concentrations; at low IL concentration, the addition of ILs could remarkably increase the lumbrokinase activity due to enhancing the hydrophilicity of casein by forming the IL-casein complex. However, at higher IL concentration, significant decrease in lumbrokinase activity was observed because the presence of ILs disturbed the hydrogen bond network in the active site of lumbrokinase. At the IL concentrations beyond their critical micelle concentrations, the incorporation of substrate into the micellar pseudo-phase also contributed to the decrease in lumbrokinase activity. When a more hydrophilic substrate was adopted, the effects of ILs on the lumbrokinase activity were negative in all cases. Fluorescence analysis indicated that hydrogen bonding was the main driving force ruling the interaction of ILs and lumbrokinase.",

Due to the magnetic nature and the presence of triazine functionalized groups, the as-prepared Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles were employed as magnetic carriers for xylanase immobilization. The xylanase immobilized on functionalized MNPs (Xy-MNP) exhibited excellent catalytic activity at pH 6.5 and 65 °C. Notably, Xy-MNPs had significant effect on juice clarity and showed quite impressive stability, even after 10 reaction cycles in the enrichment of the juices clarification, it could still retain about 55% of the initial activity. The Xy-MNPs illustrated similar clarity enrichment for three types of fruit juices, after 5 h incubation at 50 °C. The effect of metal ions and organic solvents on the activity of immobilized xylanase was investigated. The results showed an increasing in the catalytic activity of Xy-MNPs in the presence of some metal ions while they have inhibitory effect on the activity of free xylanase. Also both free and immobilized xylanase were inhibited in the presence of 50% (v/v) organic solvents, whereas the Xy-MNPs activity was significantly increased in the presence of 10% (v/v) organic solvents.

     "abstract": "l-menthol, one of the world’s largest flavor components, is widely utilized in food and cosmetics industries. Disappointingly, menthol which was synthesized by thymol hydrogenation route consisted of diastereomeric menthol mixture, containing several isomers leading to undesirable taste. Therefore, there is a need for efficient and economical way of preparing optically pure l-menthol from diastereomeric mixture. In our work, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia CGMCC 4254 lipase (SML) was chosen as a potential biocatalyst for diastereoselective acylation of l-menthol. Subsequently, different reaction factors were investigated, such as organic solvent, acyl donors, temperature, menthol concentration and molar ratio of donor to l-menthol. SML-catalyzed l-menthol acetylation reaction at 641 mM concentration and 35 °C resulted in 95.1% conversion (24 h) and 93.4% diastereomeric excess (d.e.p), which were much better than commercially available lipases tested. Finally, the acetylation reaction was scaled up to 0.9 L, resulting in an average l-menthyl acetate volumetric productivity 1.33 g/L/h with 93.4% d.e.p and 95.1% conversion. Therefore, SML is a potentially promising biocatalyst for preparation of optically pure l-menthol from diastereomeric mixture in an industrial scale.",

The study presents a new type of BOD sensor using a Geobacter-dominated biofilm selected with ethanol as the sole carbon source. Ethanol selected for biofilms with a broader substrate usage than those selected with acetate, making them better for BOD biosensing applications. The biosensor was operated at room temperature with a voltage input of −0.08 V vs SHE (−0.36 V vs Ag/AgCl) and calibrated using several dilutions of synthetic wastewater with known BOD concentrations ranging from 174 mg/L to 1200 mg/L. The charge transferred by the biofilm over a reaction time of 17.5 h was linearly correlated (R2 = 0.96) with BOD. Once calibrated, the biosensor was used to measure the BOD of cow’s milk with a reproducibility of 94% and an error of only 7.4% compared to BOD5 values. In contrast to the 5 days incubation currently required by standard BOD methods our novel biosensor offers a rapid monitoring alternative for assessments of the BOD of dairy effluent.",

     "abstract": "High-solids anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge has advantages of smaller digesters and a lower energy requirement for heating than conventional digestion, but its efficiency is negatively influenced by high solids concentration. To discover the mechanism causing this deteriorative performance, the specific methanogenic activity (SMA) of high-solids digestate was measured using typical substrates including acetate, propionate, butyrate, glucose, microcrystalline cellulose and hydrogen and carbon dioxide. When the total solids content increased from 4.2% to 14.4%, the SMA of the digestate decreased 40%–50% for most substrates except hydrogen and carbon dioxide, mainly because of blocked mass transfer in the high-solids digestate. On the other hand, some features remained stable: acetotrophic methanogens exhibited more activity than hydrogenotrophic methanogens, butyrate fermentation rather than propionate fermentation was still the main metabolic pathway during the degradation of glucose and cellulose, and hydrolysis was still the rate-limiting step during the anaerobic digestion of cellulose.",

Results of p-nitrophenyl laurate hydrolysis showed optimal stability of these biocatalysts at pH 6–8 and between 20 and 45 °C. The immobilization of lipase on nano-sized magnetic particles increased thermo and pH stabilities of the enzyme. Both catalysts displayed high hydrolytic activity on triolein and on triacylglycerols in vegetable oils in 5 min. The free lipase showed a strict 1,3-regioselectivity, whereas the immobilized lipase was only slightly 1,3-regioselective, in hydrolysis reactions of triolein and vegetable oils. Both lipases were able to hydrolyze saturated esters, but showed no typo-selectivity for this group. However, the lipases are selective for the hydrolysis of unsaturated esters, especially for 18:2 fatty acids. These results give a better knowledge of this lipase hydrolytic activity, both in the free form and immobilized and widen their potential biotechnological use, especially in the synthesis of structured lipids.",

     "abstract": "Heat treatment is often used during the processing of plant-derived biomass to precipitate host cell proteins (HCPs) and thus simplify the purification of target proteins. Plants uniquely allow this precipitation step to be applied within intact leaves rather than large volumes of cell culture supernatant or extract. However, it can be expensive and time consuming to identify the optimal conditions for HCP removal even when applying statistical experimental designs, such as the design of experiments (DoE) approach. An alternative strategy that additionally yields mechanistic insights is the modeling of heat transfer within solid-state biological specimens, such as whole leaves. Here we present a method for the numeric simulation of heat treatment in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves, and N. benthamiana leaves and whole plants, using input parameters such as the heating temperature, heat transfer coefficient, specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity, taking convective and conductive heat transfer into account. Incubation times of 0.5–1.0 min were sufficient to reach thermal equilibrium at typical heat transfer coefficients of 20–100 J s−1 m−2 K−1, and convection rather than conduction was the limiting factor, in agreement with published empirical data. The model can thus form the basis of a quality-by-design approach to remove HCPs by heat precipitation. The limits and benefits of modeling are discussed and we provide examples of potential future applications.",

Higher flux and lower HSA transmission were observed in EUF process with the feed consisting of a mixture of 1 g/L PEG and 1 g/L HSA, compared to conventional ultrafiltration (UF) process, while the PEG transmission was nearly the same. When the concentration of PEG increased from 1 g/L to 10 g/L while keeping the HSA concentration the same, more HSA passed through the membrane in the UF process due to reduction in protein diffusion and hydration by PEG. When the HSA concentration increased from 1 g/L to 10 g/L with the PEG concentration being 1 g/L, the PEG transmission decreased significantly. The application of electric field resulted in high flux and PEG transmission and low protein transmission through the membrane.

Gas hold-ups were determined by a manometric method, and VLR was calculated by circulation time of spheres with the same liquid density. Energy losses were calculated using a semi-theoretical method. The total energy dissipated in the riser and downcomer was greater for DTA reactors, whereas in the bottom was greater for SCA reactors. Non-Newtonian fluids showed higher VLR in SCA reactors, while the opposite was observed for Newtonian fluids. Excellent fits to the experimental data were achieved using simple correlations to predict εR and εD, as well as dimensionless correlations that incorporated the desired parameter (VLR).",

However, most of these studies have been restricted to production using pure cultures that require expensive reactor systems operating with high sterility and clean sugar feedstocks translating into high overall processing costs. We produced a stable lactic acid producing culture through extended non-sterile cultivation of a strain of Bacillus coagulans (strain AD) isolated in our laboratory from a thermophilic biogas reactor. The culture operated with complete and consistent production of lactic acid as the only fermentation product in a similar manner to that of the pure culture. In the present study, we assessed the effect of pH and residence times on the continuous fermentation of clarified corn stover hydrolysate for lactic acid production using our stable culture. A continuous fermenter was set up at 50 °C with pH conditions ranging from 5.5 to 6.0 and residence times ranging from 6 to 96 h. Maximum lactic acid productivity of 3.69 g/L/h was found at pH 6.0 and residence time of 6 h with a lactic acid yield of 0.95 g/g biomass sugars. It was found that the productivity increased with decrease in residence time but there was no significant effect of pH or residence time on the overall lactic acid yield. Maximum lactic acid yield was found to be 1.086 g/g biomass sugars at pH 6.0 and a residence time of 24 h showing that the culture consumed sugars other than the conventional C5 (xylose) and C6 (glucose) that was used for the yield calculation.

     "abstract": "High-salinity biotopes in Turkey and Spain have been demonstrated to be a suitable source of lipolytic enzyme-producing halophilic microorganisms. Three strains turned out to grow at high NaCl concentration (greater than 15%) and their ability to synthesize lipolytic enzymes was demonstrated on tributyrin and olive oil-containing plates by the formation of transparent or orangish halos around the colonies. The three isolates were cultivated in liquid medium and one of them was cherry-picked in terms of the enzyme production levels. It was subsequently genetically identified as Halomonas sp. LM1C. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on central composite design was used to optimize the culture conditions for lipase production, concluding that the maximum levels of lipase biosynthesis were obtained at 21.6 °C and pH 6.9. The impact of NaCl on the lipolytic activity of the obtained halophilic crude enzyme revealed an improved resistance against deactivation, when compared with a commercial lipase from Candida rugosa. The optimum reaction conditions (obtained by RSM) for the crude enzyme-biocatalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl laurate turned out to be neutral pH and 29 °C. The process at optimum conditions was kinetically characterized by means of logistic equations, obtaining maximum activities near to 250 U/L and the use of a Luedeking & Piret type model allowed elucidating the metabolic characteristics of the synthesized lipolytic enzymes. The present investigation lays the foundation for implementing a biotechnological process to produce highly resistant lipolytic enzymes able to perform its biocatalytic function under extreme salt conditions.",

In addition, ribitol oxidization for the production of d-ribulose has not yet become an industrial reality because of the lack of efficient biocatalysts, resulting in higher production costs as well as a poor yield. In this study, we have employed the Enterobacter aerogenes ribitol: NAD+ 2-oxidoreductase (EaRDH), which could efficiently and selectively convert ribitol to d-ribulose. The purified EaRDH enzyme and the recombinant Escherichia coli strain (as a whole-cell catalyst) were used to produce d-ribulose. Ribitol was efficiently converted to d-ribulose by EaRDH with a yield of ∼85%, suggesting the usefulness of this enzyme for the in vivo and in vitro production of d-ribulose from ribitol. The oxidation of ribitol to d-ribulose by EaRDH was accomplished in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of NAD+; therefore, d-ribulose production was further enhanced by the incorporation of diaphorase for continuous NAD+ regeneration. The biocatalytic process presented should be a promising route for the biotechnological production of d-ribulose (and related branched pentoses) at an efficient and industrially relevant scale.",

In this paper, a two-dimensional axisymmetric model is proposed for steady-state momentum transport in the three compartments of rPBBs under conditions and for construct permeability typical of tissue engineering applications. Transport in the inner hollow cavity and outer peripheral annulus is described according to Navier–Stokes equations, while Darcy–Brinkman equation is used for transport across the annular construct. Model predictions were qualitatively validated against literature data. Effects of the performance-determining dimensionless groups on radial flux distribution along the bioreactor length were investigated, and a criterion was proposed to design and operate rPBBs in which radial fluxes are uniformly distributed along the bioreactor length under conditions typical of tissue engineering. Bioreactor designs and operation meeting the criterion will avoid non-uniform development of tissue structure and functional properties.",

The inhibition processes caused by a high substrate concentration, lack of K+ and overloading were investigated in a long-term experiment. All the inhibition processes led to the excess of substrate that further inhibited the anammox reaction. In the substrate-based inhibition processes, ammonium, nitrite and unsuitable pH were shown to synergistically inhibit the anammox activity. Free nitrous acid (FNA) was considered the most toxic factor and should be kept below 1.5 μg L−1 to maintain stable operation over the long-term. The SAA (specific anammox activity) tests also indicated that nitrite played a major role in the substrate-based inhibitory processes. After three inhibition episodes, the substrate tolerance ability was significantly improved in the batch tests. While all the inhibition processes were able to be reversed by various compensation methods, restoration was time consuming. The consumption ratio of NO2− to NH4+ (RS) was lower than the reported ratio (1.32) and varied with changes in the operational conditions.",

To determine the volumetric mass transfer coefficient kLa or the maximum oxygen transfer capacity OTRmax the sulfite system is commonly applied.

This work proves this to be valid only for shaking frequencies above 300 rpm. Below the proportionality factor depends on the shaking frequency. More than 350 experiments with different concentrations of the sulfite system, 16 different media compositions and 10 different microorganisms were evaluated varying the shaking diameter (1.25–10 cm), flask diameter (51–131 mm), filling volume (2–160 mL) and shaking frequency (100–450 rpm). For the first time the properties of the culture media are coherently represented by a term based on the easily accessible osmolality. An universal consistent equation to calculate the OTRmax for non-baffled shake flasks for an exhaustive range of shaking conditions was developed and validated by experimental data.

F51 cells with high efficiency, but this study focused only on HPH treatment. Effects of homogenization pressure, cycle number and cell density on cell disruption efficiency were investigated. The degree of cell disruption increased with increasing high homogenization pressure (10–40 kpsi) and cycle number (1–4). Cell density in the range of 2.0–90 g/L did not affect the performance of cell disruption process, while a higher specific energy consumption arised when using a lower cell concentration. The HPLC analysis showed that the main carotenoids present in Desmodesmus sp. F51 were neoxanthin, violaxanthin, lutein, α-carotene and β-carotene. Moreover, the developed HPH model could well describe the cell disruption behavior at various high homogenization pressures (10–40 kpsi) and cycle numbers (1–4). The obtained parameters indicate that homogenization pressure is a more significant factor than cycle number in achieving high cell disruption efficiency.",

These independent variables were tested in duplicate at three levels, while dry biomass productivity was used as the response. The results were used to construct two models, one based on Response surface methodology (RSM) and another on Artificial neural network (ANN). Two different training methods (10-fold cross validation and training/testing) were utilized to obtain two different network architectures, while a Genetic algorithm was utilized to obtain optimal concentrations of the above medium components. A quadratic regression by RSM (R2 = 0.840) was the best modeling and optimization tool under the specific conditions selected here. The highest biomass productivity (approximately 2.14 gDW/L h) was ensured by the following optimal levels: 7.04–9.99% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.430–0.503% (w/v) magnesium sulfate and 4.0% (w/v) ammonium sulfate.

Therefore, alternative processes are under investigation. Many human mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (hMSC) bioreactor-based manufacturing processes, in particular, are complicated by the requirement to separate cells from microcarriers with high cell yield and viability whilst maintaining target phenotypic and functional characteristics. Here we review currently available technologies and ongoing development for the expansion of cellular therapeutics, with focus on allogeneic hMSCs and microcarrier-based processes. Upstream challenges include the interplay between the cell culture substrate and media formulation, sourcing of high quality animal-free reagents, and considerations for the use of microcarriers in stirred-tank systems.

     "abstract": "Cell-based therapies have the potential to contribute to global healthcare, whereby the use of living cells and tissues can be used as medicinal therapies. Despite this potential, many challenges remain before the full value of this emerging field can be realized. The characterization of input material for cell-based therapy bioprocesses from multiple donors is necessary to identify and understand the potential implications of input variation on process development. In this work, we have characterized bone marrow derived human mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSCs) from multiple donors and discussed the implications of the measurable input variation on the development of autologous and allogeneic cell-based therapy manufacturing processes. The range of cumulative population doublings across the five BM-hMSC lines over 30 days of culture was 5.93, with an 18.2% range in colony forming efficiency at the end of the culture process and a 55.1% difference in the production of interleukin-6 between these cell lines. It has been demonstrated that this variation results in a range in the process time between these donor hMSC lines for a hypothetical product of over 13 days, creating potential batch timing issues when manufacturing products from multiple patients. All BM-hMSC donor lines demonstrated conformity to the ISCT criteria but showed a difference in cell morphology. Metabolite analysis showed that hMSCs from the different donors have a range in glucose consumption of 26.98 pmol cell−1 day−1, Lactate production of 29.45 pmol cell−1 day−1 and ammonium production of 1.35 pmol cell−1 day−1, demonstrating the extent of donor variability throughout the expansion process. Measuring informative product attributes during process development will facilitate progress towards consistent manufacturing processes, a critical step in the translation cell-based therapies.",

In addition, we also reported a scaleable protocol for the detachment from microcarriers in spinner flasks of hMSCs from two donors. The essence of the protocol is the use of a short period of intense agitation in the presence of enzymes such that the cells are detached; but once detachment is achieved, the cells are smaller than the Kolmogorov scale of turbulence and hence not damaged. Here, the same approach has been effective for culture at NJS and detachment in-situ in 15 mL ambr™ bioreactors, 100 mL spinner flasks and 250 mL Dasgip bioreactors. In these experiments, cells from four different donors were used along with two types of microcarrier with and without surface coatings (two types), four different enzymes and three different growth media (with and without serum), a total of 22 different combinations. In all cases after detachment, the cells were shown to retain their desired quality attributes and were able to proliferate.

To fill this gap, this study used both CFD Reynolds-Averaged and Large-Eddy Simulations to characterize the hydrodynamics inside 250 mL mini-bioreactors, which is a relevant volume for hMSC cultures. Five impeller geometries were studied. From the velocity and turbulence fields calculated, an energy dissipation/circulation function, related to both frequency and intensity of potentially damaging hydrodynamic events for the cells, was determined for various operating conditions. Based on the simulation results, the marine propeller operating in up-pumping mode seems to be the most adapted condition, since it exhibits a low frequency of exposure to an acceptable intensity of the turbulent dissipation rate. From a general point of view, the new methodology proposed should be used in the future to screen the most adapted bioreactor geometry to biological constraints.",

The decisional tool comprises a bioprocess economics model linked to a search algorithm to assess the financial impact of manual and automated bioprocessing strategies that use 2D-planar tissue culture technologies. The tool was applied to a case study that examines the production of patient-specific iPSC-derived neurons for drug screening. The production strategies were compared across three analytical drug screening methods, each requiring cell production at a distinct scale (manual patch-clamp analysis, high throughput screening and plate-based pharmacology), as well as different annual cell line utilization requirements (‘throughputs’) (between 10 and 100 lines) so as to represent different industry scenarios. The tool determined the critical cell line throughput where the most cost-effective production strategy switched from the manual to automated workflow. The key process economics driver was the number of iPSC expansion stages required. Stochastic modelling of the bioprocess illustrated that the automated was more robust than the manual workflow in the scenarios investigated.

In an aerobic environment, the microbes in biofilter oxidize odorous gases like hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and ammonia (NH3) to non-odorous sulphate and nitrate. This paper describes a pilot plant biofilter setup at a local waste water treatment plant (WWTP) which has been in continuous operation for more than 150 days, removes both H2S and NH3 at an average removal efficiency of 91.96% and 100%, respectively. Unlike a conventional biofilter, the pH of this biofilter was not adjusted by addition of chemicals or buffers and the H2SO4 produced from the biological conversion of H2S is periodically washed down and allowed to accumulate in a concentrated form at the base of the biofilter. NH3 entering at the base is removed, not by biological oxidation, but by the chemical reaction of ammonium with sulphate to form ammonium sulphate. The ammonium sulphate produced in biofilter is washed down and the volume of leachate produced is less than 0.2 mL of leachate/L of reactor/day. Estimated cost savings of converting the current chemical scrubber used at the WWTP to a similar biofilter described in this study is included with this paper.",

The binding pH ranges for the two ligands were different, but the optimum pH values were the same for each other (pH 6.0). Both the ligands showed high specificity and bound hIgG mainly by electrostatic interactions. Ligand binding competition experiments revealed that the binding sites on hIgG for the two octapeptides were similar to those for Protein A. Finally, hIgG was purified from human serum with high purities and recovery yields with the two peptide affinity columns. Thus, among the 15 peptide candidates, a total of five octapeptides were identified as high-affinity ligands of hIgG. The five ligands were all derived from the same peptide model FYxHxxxE (where x denotes any amino acid) and contained four common hot spots F132, Y133, H137, and E143 of the affinity motif of Protein A.

It was found that over-expressing acs2 (encoding acetyl-CoA synthase) and deleting mls1 (encoding malate synthase) increased SAM by 0.86- and 1.30-fold, respectively. To eliminate feedback inhibition of SAM synthase, a codon-optimized metK1 was introduced into 2842, and an increase of 1.45-fold of SAM was observed. Subsequently, metK1 and acs2 were co-expressed in the mls1 deleted strain, obtained the highly SAM-productive strain Ymls1 △GAPmK, and 2.22 g/L of SAM accumulated, which was 3.36-fold that in 2842. Moreover, the Ymls1 △GAPmK strain yielded 6.06 g/L SAM, which was 9.18-fold that in 2842, by fed-batch fermentation in a 10-L fermenter. Finally, the isolation and purification of SAM from yeast cell and preparation of SAM sulfate were preliminarily investigated. This study demonstrated that up-regulating acs2 and deleting mls1, which elevated intracellular acetyl-CoA levels, effectively enhanced the intracellular methionine biosynthesis. The elevated intracellular acetyl-CoA levels ultimately enhanced SAM accumulation, whereas the introduction of metK1 enhanced the redirection of acetyl-CoA to SAM biosynthesis in Ymls1 △GAPmK strain.",

Greater than 75% removal of volatile solids and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) were observed. The high effluent quality was attributed to the formation of a biologically active floccular sludge layer, which allowed for separation of hydraulic and mean cell residence times (HRT and MCRT). A reduced order transport model was developed and validated using field tracer study data. Key assumptions of the reduced order model were verified via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. The mean HRT predicted by the reduced order model was 23 days and was in good agreement with the tracer experiment. A simplified floccular sludge biological process model was developed and used to estimate an average MCRT of 115 days. The results showed that household-scale tubular anaerobic digesters can provide enough biogas to meet households’ cooking energy needs, which was consistent with field results.

Herein, a primary amino-functionalized resin (ESR-1) was selected for immobilizing rPPE01W187H, and the resulting immobilized enzyme, rPPE01W187H@ESR-1, exhibited notably enhanced stability. No obvious inactivation was observed for rPPE01W187H@ESR-1 following its incubation at 30 °C for 1440 h, whereas the half-life of the free enzyme was only 50.2 h under the same conditions. A continuous process was subsequently developed using rPPE01W187H@ESR-1 in a packed bed reactor, which allowed for the immobilized enzyme to be conveniently recycled. The space-time yield for biocatalytic resolution of 2-acetoxy-2-(2′-chlorophenyl)acetate in this packed bed reactor reached as high as 3.34 kg L−1 d−1 following the optimization of the critical process parameters, including the initial pH, H:D ratio and flow direction.

This study reported an on-site method using the torque meter equipped on hydrolysis reactors for its rheological property measurement. The measured torque data were transformed into the apparent viscosity and then the rheological parameters of the power law model after correlation. The determined parameters were applied to develop the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for simulating mixing efficiency and power consumption.

COD/NO3−-N ratio of 8.0 was proved to be a critical point of the SDM process and sludge at this ratio was selected for analysis. BET, SEM, FTIR and zeta potential measurement were used to characterize the micro-structure, functional groups and surface charge of the granular sludge related to nitrate addition. SEM observation showed that rod-shaped bacteria were predominant at the surface of granules and FTIR spectrum (1745 cm−1) presented an evidence for the carboxyl group protonation upon reduction of the cytochrome c oxidase. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to analyze the microbial structure and diversity. Archaea was found to be accounted for 3.33% of the total microbial communities and Methanosaeta and Methanobacterium were the dominant archaeas. Otherwise, Proteobacteria (63.00%), Bacteroidetes (21.79%) and Firmicutes (9.73%) phyla were identified to be the three dominant bacterial communities. Enterobacteriaceae was detected with a content of 50.24% of the total bacterial sequences and might be the core bacterium contributed to the SDM process. The results would provide vital guidances for the design and stable operation of nitrate-containing wastewater treatment.",

     "abstract": "Hydrogen production by fermentation with granular anaerobic biomass has been regarded as one alternative to obtain clean energy. However critical aspects such as process conditions to obtain hydrogenogenic granules have been scarcely investigated. In this work two inoculum pretreatments and different upward liquid velocities (ULV) in expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactors were applied to determine the influence of these parameters on the formation, structure and specific hydrogenogenic activity (SHA) of the granules. Heat pretreated inoculum produced granules with greater manipulation resistance compared to those produced with wash-out pretreatment. Furthermore, the increase of ULV (2.5–4.5 m/h) generated bigger granules with a granule size distribution with a trend to a normal distribution and higher protein to carbohydrate ratios. Mass balances showed that propionate was the main metabolite, nonetheless, its production decreased substantially as the ULV applied increased, indicating a selective wash-out of propionate-producing bacteria. In the opposite way, SHA values were higher as the ULV applied increased as a result of selective enrichment and better mass transfer conditions. The whole results indicated that the inoculum pretreatment and hydrodynamic conditions play a key role in the formation, structure and in the biological properties of hydrogen-producing granules in EGSB reactors.",

     "abstract": "Co-culture strategy has drawn increasing interest in the last a few years to ferment the mixture of glucose and xylose or lignocellulosic hydrolysate. However, existing research has been mostly qualitative which mainly examined the ethanol production performance of the co-culture system such as final ethanol yield and productivity, with little or no attempt made to understand the dynamic interactions between the two microbes. This is partially due to the difficulties associated with monitoring and control of co-culture systems. In this work, we developed a bioreactor and associated protocols and control strategies to facilitate quantitative and systematic study of co-culture systems. In particular, the reported equipment, operation protocols and control strategies can deliver chemostat operation under controlled stable operation conditions by achieving stable oxygen utilization rates at various levels. In addition, the developed membrane-separated co-culture bioreactor enables independent control of the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels in each chamber, and easy tracking of individual biomass of each strain. The new protocol is a dual continuous/pseudo-continuous operation mode, which allows the control of constant biomass by adjusting the operation time of each mode, dilution rate and feed concentration. Experimental results on the co-culture system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Scheffersomyces stipitis are provided to demonstrate the capabilities of the developed co-culture bioreactor. With the developed equipment and protocol, simultaneous and complete utilization of both glucose and xylose was achieved around 70 h into the experiments we conducted, and was maintained as long as 800 h. Such complete utilization can be maintained even longer if desired. In addition, different OUR conditions (ranging 0.0036–0.0045 mmol O2/gDCW/h) were tested under controlled chemostat. Under the different operation conditions tested, ethanol yields and conversion rates varied in the range of 0.12–0.44 g/g and 0.22–1.95 g EtOH/L/h, respectively, which are in line with results reported in the literature.",

Despite this success, the future presents new challenges that include productivity increase, product quality modulation for comparability and biosimilarity, and efficient manufacturing of novel modalities. While empirical process development techniques will continue to play an important role in addressing these challenges, approaches based on mechanistic understanding are likely to be more impactful for solving the more complex multidimensional problems by providing insights into the interplays between the cell line, bioprocess, and product quality. Systems biology is one such approach that provides information on cellular physiology at the molecular level, which, when rigorously interpreted, can provide targets for cell line and/or process modifications. We present a general framework for applying systems biology to biotherapeutic-producing mammalian cells and summarize published work that exemplifies successful applications of this technique. We highlight gaps in our current understanding that limit widespread application of systems biology to mammalian cell-based bioprocess development and propose remediation methods that can encourage increased adoption. More nuanced understanding of cellular physiology and the interplay between expressing novel proteins and product quality attributes is possible through systems biology and this understanding will better position the field to successfully engage with the challenges of the future.",

Phenol and TCE were fed into the reactors alternately, and both were efficiently removed during 6 weeks of operation. Compared with the control reactor receiving no TCE, biomass in the TCE-fed reactors had lower phenol-dependent specific oxygen utilization rate, but higher concentration, bigger size, and better settling ability. The morphology of the biomass in TCE and control reactors exhibited distinct characteristics. Granules in the TCE reactors slightly broke up early in the operation, but generally retained their shape and structure throughout. The biomass in the control reactor, however, lost its granular structure and totally disintegrated into flocs. Therefore, TCE co-metabolism likely improved the structural integrity of aerobic granular sludge, and co-metabolic degradation of TCE by phenol-grown aerobic granules showed long term stability.",

Total nitrogen (TN) removal was markedly enhanced from 45.8% to 61.9%, as the internal recycle ratio increased from 100% to 300%. N2O generation was increased from 3.47 to 9.81 × 10−2 mg/L during the treatment process, with the anoxic section showing the largest N2O increment from denitrification. This phenomenon is attributed to the increased amount of nitrate (NO3−-N) substrate available for denitrification, due to the increased volume of internal recycle liquid, as well as the increased amount of oxygen, which could restrain the activity of nitrous oxide reductase brought to the anoxic section. Nitrous oxide reductase was more sensitive to oxygen than nitrate and nitrite reductases. Microorganism analysis indicated that the population of nosZ gene-containing bacteria was only slightly affected by the recycle ratio. However, the number of nosZ gene copies decreased as the internal recycle ratio increased from 100% to 300%; this result reveals noticeable decreases in the denitrification capacity of the system for reducing N2O to N2.",

With real municipal wastewater at low carbon/nitrogen ratio (COD/TN = 3.50), the influence of hydraulic retention time (HRT = 6 –12 h) in the AAO reactor on denitrifying phosphorus removal was observed. The mass balance analysis demonstrated that the system saved about 30–35% carbon sources compared with traditional biological nutrient removal (BNR) systems. HRT of 10 h was found to be optimal for denitrifying phosphorous removal due to the limitation of poly-β-hydroxyalkanoates (PHA) utilization and denitrification capacity (NO3−-N/PO43−-P ratio). It was also determined that the NO3−-N concentration of the middle settler should be kept around 1.50–2.50 mg/L to prevent secondary phosphorus release. Finally, anoxic duration and NO3−-N loading were the major limiting factors for denitrifying phosphorus accumulation organisms (DNPAOs) growth.",

The variation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in conditioning process was investigated in detail to unravel the reaction mechanism. The results indicated that sludge dewaterability was improved by decreasing solution pH in terms of filtration rate and cake solids content. At acid conditions, protonation of EPS resulted in reduction of negative charge and densification of sludge floc. Sludge conditioning efficiency was improved with decrease in pH. Ferrate can solubilize EPS through oxidation process and also remove a portion of soluble EPS (SEPS) by charge neutralization and interfacial adsorption of hydrolyzed ferric ions, consequently compressing EPS and decreasing total extractable EPS content. In addition, when pH and potassium ferrate were 3 and 0.1 g/gTSS, the sludge filtration dewatering rate and extent reached the maximum. Deterioration of sludge dewaterability was observed as the ferrate was overdosed (>0.2 g/gTSS). This could be attributed to the release of a large amount of bound EPS (BEPS) as a result of ferrate oxidation, consequently increasing the sludge filtration resistance.",

A novel method based on fluid dynamic gauging has been developed for measuring the thickness and the shear stress needed for removal of the biofilms formed on cylindrical surfaces. The device operates with the test cylinder immersed in liquid: liquid is withdrawn or ejected from a nozzle located near the biofilm surface. There is no net change of liquid volume, making it ideal for sterile and aseptic operation and for studies using valuable liquids. Biofilm removal may also be tested by using appropriate hydrodynamic conditions.Calibration tests using ejection and suction flows in the laminar regime (Reynolds number around 100) indicated a measurement accuracy of ±19 μm and showed good agreement with computational fluid dynamics simulations. The device was commissioned in tests on Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilms formed on high density polyethylene (HDPE) and stainless steel (SS) cylinders of diameter 25 mm under conditions of mild shear stress (around 2 Pa in these tests). The biofilm thickness was not uniform to the eye and measurements made over the surface of the test cylinders confirmed this: layer thicknesses ranged from effectively 0–300 μm.

Since oxygen dissolution under oenological conditions is not fully understood, these additions are carried out empirically, resulting in unpredictable concentrations and heterogeneous oxygen distributions within the fermentation tank. In this research, we develop a model to predict the evolution of the oxygen dissolution rate in the must during alcoholic fermentations. The model includes two partial differential equations that describe oxygen spatial distribution during the fermentation in both liquid and gaseous phases. These equations incorporate the effects of recirculation and mixing. Also, a set of ordinary differential equations describing the kinetics of relevant fermentation variables is included. The model is validated by fermenting a Sauvignon blanc must in a bubble column with five micro-bubblers for oxygen injection. Additions are made every ten points of decrease in the fermenting musts’ density. Model simulations and experimental results confirm that CO2 is responsible for the observed reduction in the oxygen dissolution rate during the exponential growth phase, and that viable yeast cells significantly reduce this rate compared with an abiotic bubbling CO2 system. The model developed will help to design more effective oxygen addition systems through micro-bubbling for wine fermentation tanks.",

The enhancement of nitrite consumption was consistent well with the acceleration of methane depletion, further confirmed the electrical stimulation of n-damo process. However, the enhancement could only be realized under continuous electrical exposure mode, rather than intermittent mode. The above results demonstrated that electrical stimulation could lead to an enhanced denitrification of n-damo bacteria.",

     "abstract": "Recently, the focus of biotechnological research has shifted towards the improvement of biological processes. Among the various approaches to achieve this goal, the use of cell-free technology is receiving considerable attention because it offers several economic and technical benefits. This technology improves biological processes in several ways, leading to enhanced efficacy, stability, specificity, and selectivity, as well as allowing reconstruction of target metabolic pathways. However, the adaptation of this technology to large-scale industrial processes remains a major challenge. This review describes the major constrains of whole-cell-based biological processes and how cell-free systems have been used to overcome such limitations. Furthermore, the shortcomings of conventional cell-free systems and possible solutions involving developments in immobilization technology are discussed. Finally, we illustrate the development of synthetic metabolic systems using the principles of metabolic engineering and discuss their possible advantages in the production of biofuels and bioproducts. In short, this review describes the fundamentals of and provides new insights into cell-free and immobilization technologies for the improvement of synthetic metabolic systems.",

This study investigated the treatment of brewery wastewater using an advanced anaerobic membrane reactor (AnMBR). The results suggest that the AnMBR can achieve a COD removal higher than 98% when treating brewery wastewater, with a biogas yield of 0.53 ± 0.015 m3 biogas/kgCOD at 35 °C. It was found that the 0.04-μm UF membrane played an important role in reducing COD concentrations in the AnMBR effluent. The observed specific MLVSS growth rate and yield for the AnMBR system tested were determined as 0.022 ± 0.001 gVSS/gVSS/d and 0.029 ± 0.001 gVSS/gCOD, respectively. The critical flux for the membrane filtration with the AnMBR system tested was in the range of 8.64 ± 0.69 L/m2/h, and the results showed that chemical recovery cleaning is necessary to maintain a stable, long-termoperation at a filtration flux of 8 L/m2/h when treating brewery wastewater. The size fraction analysis of the EPS showed that particulate proteins and polysaccharides were the dominant forms of EPS in the AnMBR, which could exert a critical influence on the filtration behavior of the membrane process under the sub-critical flux condition in AnMBRs.",

The highest enhancement of AG accumulation was achieved in 34 day-old AMHRCs elicited by 157.4 μM MJ for 18.4 h. The resulting AG yield was 5.5 ± 0.13 mg/g dry weight (DW), which was 2.1-fold higher than that of non-treated control (2.7 ± 0.05 mg/g DW). Moreover, transcriptional analyses revealed that MVD, IDI, FPS and SS were the potential key regulated genes in AG biosynthetic pathway.

     "publication date": "01-2016",
     "abstract": "Thermodynamically constrained stoichiometric-based models have been widely used for the estimation of feasible flux distributions of a metabolic network. The prediction of a zero net flux through a reaction indicates that this reaction is either blocked (the enzyme is absent) or at equilibrium (the enzyme is present but the Gibbs free energy change of the reaction is zero). The estimation of the thermodynamic equilibrium of a reaction requires the exact knowledge of environmental conditions and metabolites’ concentrations. This information, however, is not always available. Here, the effect of considering that a reaction is at equilibrium instead of being blocked on the metabolic flux distribution is analysed. The central carbon metabolism of Actinobacillus succinogenes for the production of succinic acid from glycerol has been used as case study, based on results from experiments in 1.8 L batch bioreactors. The impact of changes in ionic strength (I), temperature (T), intracellular pHc and medium pHe was also investigated, revealing that only I and T affect the prediction of flux distributions compared with those obtained at standard biological conditions when zero flux reactions are considered either as blocked or at equilibrium. In general, the range of fluxes estimated for the equilibrium case is narrower than that for the blocked case.",

     "abstract": "In enzymatic reactions, the modeling of the degree of hydrolysis (DH) is desirable given its influence on many functional and biological activities. Empirical approaches are preferred to phenomenological ones to model the complexity of enzymatic reactions. Artificial Neuronal Networks (ANN) are able to process large sets of data where no linear relationships between them are expected. In this work, a feedforward ANN, comprising 10 neurons in the hidden layer, was successfully employed to model the DH as a function of the initial concentration of horse mackerel protein (tested at 2.5 g/L, 5 g/L and 7.5 g/L), the reaction temperature (40 °C, 47.5 °C and 55 °C), the time of reaction (up to 4 h) and the percentage of subtilisin in the enzyme mixture (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%). The resulting ANN model was optimized by an evolutionary algorithm, obtaining a maximum (DH 17.1%) at 2.54 g/L, 40 °C, 4 h and an enzyme mixture comprising 38.3% of subtilisin and the rest of trypsin. The combination of trypsin and subtilisin led to higher DH than the sole use of subtilisin (DH 15.5% at 52 °C). Furthermore, the former optimum was attained at lower reaction temperature, which reduces both the operational costs and the nutritional losses.",

From day 26 and onwards, partial nitritation was stable and operated with an effluent NO2－-N/NH4＋-N ratio of 1.15 ± 0.09, which was a suitable mixture to feed subsequent anammox. The free ammonia overwhelmingly restrained the activity of nitrite oxidizers. High nitrite accumulation efficiency of 94.6 ± 3.1% was achieved throughout the experiment.

Similar E. coli kinetics were observed at an initial kLa of 46 h−1, but not at 92 h−1 where differences in DOT and culture parameters were found, mainly in growth rate and biomass yield on glucose, which is the result of different oxygen transfer rates due to the increased gas pressures in RAM.",

Rheological properties of raw and pretreated lignocellulose materials had been characterized in previous studies. A large gap of rheological properties between the raw and pretreated lignocellulose raised a difficulty for designing proper pretreatment reactors with maximum efficiency and minimum power consumption. In this study, the dilute acid pretreatment was operated in a 20-L reactor equipped with helical ribbon impeller agitation at high solids content up to 70% (w/w) dry solids. The operation was stopped at different time points, and then the completely or incompletely pretreated lignocellulose materials were released and sent for rheological property measurement. The changing rheological properties of lignocellulose materials were recorded into an evolution profile. The apparent viscosity change was found to be closely related to pretreatment temperature, and then affected the consequent enzymatic hydrolysis yield. The dynamic rheological parameters were fitted into power law model and the CFD model was established for high solids content pretreatment and used for industrial reactor design. Furthermore, the apparent viscosity of the raw and pretreated corn stover and wheat straw increased, instead of decreased, raising an instinct difference with the system of rigid solid particles and water.

Using a library of the XCXPXRX repertoire displayed on the p3 protein coat of fd phage, we devised a phage screening strategy for identifying FGE substrates. Our methods of screening phage possessing possible substrates for enzymatic activity made use of the unique aldehyde residues produced on the substrate by reaction with FGE, which facilitated covalent capture of phage onto magnetic beads. This sequence dependent conversion/capture in conjunction with an unexpected sequence dependence of the enzymatic elution step used to liberate the phage for propagation served as the evolutionary selection pressures. The resulting HCTPRRP sequence identified from this phage screening procedure was an effective substrate for FGE, and through the course of the screening process it was selected for its propensity to be cleaved by trypsin. We anticipate this unique methodology for enzyme substrate screening may be applicable to selection of novel enzyme-substrate pairs by virtue of either sequence dependent immobilization or sequence dependent elution.",

     "abstract": "Improved understanding of heterogeneous cellulose hydrolysis by cellulases is the basis for optimising enzymatic catalysis-based cellulosic biorefineries. A detailed mechanistic model is developed to describe the dynamic adsorption/desorption and synergistic chain-end scissions of cellulases (endoglucanase, exoglucanase, and β-glucosidase) upon amorphous cellulose. The model can predict evolutions of the chain lengths of insoluble cellulose polymers and production of soluble sugars during hydrolysis. Simultaneously, a modelling framework for uncertainty analysis is built based on a quasi-Monte-Carlo method and global sensitivity analysis, which can systematically identify key parameters, help refine the model and improve its identifiability. The model, initially comprising 27 parameters, is found to be over-parameterized with structural and practical identification problems under usual operating conditions (low enzyme loadings). The parameter estimation problem is therefore mathematically ill posed. The framework allows us, on the one hand, to identify a subset of 13 crucial parameters, of which more accurate confidence intervals are estimated using a given experimental dataset, and, on the other hand, to overcome the identification problems. The model’s predictive capability is checked against an independent set of experimental data. Finally, the optimal composition of cellulases cocktail is obtained by model-based optimisation both for enzymatic hydrolysis and for the process of simultaneous saccharification and fermentation.",

Here we report the synthesis of gelatin nanofibers by electrospinning, followed by testing them as a potential carrier for oral drug delivery system for a model hydrophobic drug, piperine. Electrospun gelatin nanofibers were crosslinked by exposing to saturated glutaraldehyde (GTA) vapor, to improve their water resistive properties. An exposure of only 6 min was not only adequate to control the early degradation with intact fiber morphology, but also significantly marginalized any adverse effects associated with the use of GTA. Scanning electron microscopy imaging, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis were done to study nanofiber morphology, stability of drug and effect of crosslinking. The pH of release medium was also varied as per the gastrointestinal tract for in-vitro drug release study. Results illustrate good compatibility of hydrophobic drug in gelatin nanofibers with promising controlled drug release patterns by varying crosslinking time and pH of release medium.",

     "abstract": "Glucose oxidase (GOD) enzyme is widely used as a sensing molecule for glucose and is thus immobilized in different porous hosts for sensing applications. We have synthesized different morphologies of mesoporous silica (SBA-15) host particles and impregnated GOD in it. Rod and cuboid shaped SBA-15 particles having internal pore diameters of 6.8 and 11.4 nm respectively, were synthesized, in order to measure enzyme activity. The latter primarily determines the performance of a glucose sensor. In this quest, we therefore developed a mathematical model to predict variation of glucose concentration with time, by considering diffusion, adsorption and reaction rates of glucose by immobilized GOD. The model was validated with our own experiments, by fitting diffusion coefficient of glucose inside mesopores and the competitive product inhibition constant of GOD. The validated model indicates that, specific activity of GOD immobilized in SBA-15 is lower at higher GOD loading. Thus, this provides insight into the effect of pore-confinement on diffusion and reaction kinetics of the substrate (glucose) by an immobilized enzyme (GOD). Understanding the interplay of chemical transport and reaction kinetics issues in a porous solid nanoparticle host (SBA-15) can lead to superior detection and measurement of glucose concentration.",

In order to understand how the of enzyme is influenced by ionic liquids, we performed a combined experimental and molecular dynamics simulation study of Renilla luciferase in ionic liquids. Our results revealed a main tunnel in the structure of Renilla luciferase, and demonstrated that the conformational changes of the main tunnel are directly related to enzyme activity and the enzyme activity is decreased severely in the presence of [BMIM][BF4] and [BMIM][PF6]. While the main tunnel shows a screw in shape in the region near to active site in the presence of [BMIM][BF4], the entrance to the main tunnel is modulated by alanine 150 and isoleucine 265 in the presence of [BMIM][PF6]. The protein-ionic liquid interactions also have impact on the structure of enzyme, especially in [BMIM][PF6], where interactions of Renilla luciferase (with α/β Fold) with fluorine anions causes a conformational collapse in the exposed α-helices. Based on the results, the structural distortions in Renilla luciferase in the presence of ionic liquids is started from the outer layer of the enzyme, a model which is called the “α-shield collapse” model.",

Instead of NAD, both Aa-LDH and As-LDH utilized various organic dyes as the electron acceptor. In addition, Aa-LDH and As-LDH exhibited substrate specificity for d-lactate only.

The chemical synthesis of adipic acid is of serious consequences such as greenhouse gases and heavy pollution to the environment, etc. The researchers are struggling to establish more reliable, renewable and affordable adipic acid synthesis methods, and among which, biological synthesis of adipic acid is attracting the most attention. There are two biological routes for adipate synthesis: (1) biological accumulations of precursors of adipic acid such as d-glucaric acid and cis,cis-muconic acid, which can be further catalyzed to adipate; (2) synthesis of adipate directly from carbon source. With the emergence of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology, biological synthesis of adipic acid from renewable substrates is now feasible.

The SWRBR was designed after applying the three fundamental concepts of TRIZ and identification of the principal contradictions in SWTBR. The proposed coupling between the essential ecosystems characteristics especially, the trophic reactions and the matter recycling was used to solve the identified contradictions in SWTBR and to design SWRBR. The dense microbial communities especially associated with animals through gastrointestinal tract and plants through rhizosphere constitute excellent models to design sustainable wastes recycling bioreactors (SWRBR).

A density of phospholipids within the range of 10–30% could reduce both the rate of production and the final yield of biodiesel. Phospholipids in the oil leads to the formation of water-in-oil phospholipid-based reverse micelles. The water that activates the enzymatic process is observed to be trapped inside these reverse micelles. This has resulted in the inactivation of the reaction systems and has subsequently led to the deactivation of the immobilized lipase by the extended residence time of the added methanol. A reaction system involving gentle agitation and higher amount of water was found to reduce the reverse micelles formation. This simple technique improved the conversion efficiency by approximately 3-folds, producing a final biodiesel of more than 90%, using immobilized A. oryzae whole cells expressing Fusarium heterosporum lipase. This demonstrates that, the above technique could be successfully applied to the enzymatic biodiesel conversion of oils containing high amounts of phospholipids such as that from microalgae.",

The relevant rate constants were evaluated by changing water, methanol, FFA and enzyme concentrations. The results were compared to the immobilized catalyst Novozym 435 (Nvz). The intriguing difference was observed for the apparent equilibrium constants of CTL (high Keqapp) and Nvz (low Keqapp). This thermodynamic “inconsistency” was explained by absence or presence of the catalyst carrier. Nvz carrier particles apparently help to disperse water, increasing its surface and hydrolytic activity in comparison to CTL. Another reactant, methanol, had a dual effect acting as (i) a substrate and (ii) a solvent of water in oil phase. The latter effect added to hydrolytic activity and decreased Keqapp at increasing methanol (0–0.5 M). Inhibition and inactivation of CTL by methanol (<8% v/v) were insignificant.

The decomposition temperature of cyanophycin was around 230 °C for both forms of cyanophycin, as measured by thermogravimetric analysis. Soluble cyanophycin showed no toxicity to Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells at a concentration of 5 mg/mL as revealed by the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide method. When the insoluble cyanophycin formed thin films, the films exhibited a structure of stacking lamellae. CHO cells grown on the films had a higher relative cell density, or 107–142% that of those grown on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS), 48 h after seeding. After the removal of serum-containing medium, the CHO cells maintained cell morphology for up to 72 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium without serum, and the relative cell density was 150–170% that of the cells grown on TCPS 48 h after serum removal, indicating that the cyanophycin substratum could provide sustained cell growth. When RAW 246.7 cells were grown on the films of insoluble cyanophycin for 96 h, nitric oxide concentration released from the macrophages was below 2 mM/mg protein, suggesting that a minimal immune response was elicited. The results showed that cyanophycin might have the potential to serve as a biocompatible, degradable material in biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering and drug delivery.",

     "abstract": "Cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) from Bacillus sp. C26 was highly stable when it was immobilized in mixed alginate–gelatin gel beads. Enzymatic synthesis of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) from starch by immobilized CGTase was performed in a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) and a packed-bed reactor (PBR). A comparative study on reaction kinetics found that the apparent maximum production rate (Vmax,app) for reaction in CSTR (0.5742 g L−1 h−1) was higher than that in PBR (0.33 g L−1 h−1) likely due to the higher mass transfer rate in CSTR. The lower apparent Michaelis–Menten constant (Km,app) in PBR (31.88 g L−1) compared to that in CSTR (58.3 g L−1) indicate that the enzyme in PBR required lower amount of substrate to become half-saturated. The appropriate dilution rate for operation in both reactors was the same at 0.75 h−1. To effectively produce β-CD, an integrated CSTR-PBR was developed. Through this integrated system, the final β-CD concentration and yield were improved from 6.10 g L−1 and 15.3% in a single CSTR up to 10.6 g L−1 and 26.5%, respectively. Moreover, the immobilized CGTase had good operational stability for 96 h of continuous use. This study has shown that the integrated CSTR-PBR was effective for continuous production of β-CD from starch and may greatly contribute to developing industrialized production of β-CD.",

The stability consists of shear stability and removal stability, which are characterized by the shear sensitivity (Kss) and by the relative standard deviation of the specific nitrogen removal rate for three consecutive days (RSD-N3), respectively. Two upflow granular sludge blanket (USB) reactors under different hydraulic shear conditions were used to culture granular sludge. The Kss of the mature granular sludge in USBH (G = 24.7 s−1) and USBL (G = 14.5 s−1) were 0.000024 and 0.0051, respectively. The USBH only required 56 days to obtain mature granular sludge, whereas the USBL required 70 days. These results indicated that higher hydraulic shear tended to shorten the granulation time and enhance the shear stability of the granular sludge. The RSD-N3 of the USBL during the maturation period was only 3.68%, which is approximately 32.84% of the value for the USBH, indicating better removal stability for the nitrogen with the USBL. SEM indicated bacillus bacteria were the largest component of the granular microbial community, and metagenomics using high-throughput sequencing identified Methyloversatilis and Azospira as the dominant microorganisms. These findings are important for the development of technologies in this field and have extensive applications in the denitrification of granular sludge.",

We obtained an EG-SFP-encapsulated silica matrix (EG-SFP@Silica) via the EG-SFP-mediated auto-silicification process under ambient conditions. The immobilization efficiency was 90%. The introduction of SFP did not significantly affect the functionality of EG, and moreover, EG-SFP@Silica demonstrated higher thermostability by 5 °C than free EG-SFP or EG. In addition, EG-SFP@Silica retained 90% of its initial residual activity with up to 18 uses.

Furthermore, dual stage pH and agitation control regime was considered where in the initial 10 h the pH value was 7.5 and the agitation rate used was 200 rpm favoring bacterial growth, while these values were subsequently changed to a pH value of 6.5 and an agitation rate of 150 rpm leading to enhanced accumulation of 2,3-BD. Production of 85 g/l of 2,3-BD was achieved with ethanol and acetoin as the only by-products. Total productivity of 1.73 g/l/h with a yield of 0.48 g of 2,3-BD per g of glucose was achieved in the 150 l bioreactor.

The cold storage of trypsin in ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.2) with the addition of cryoprotectants, such as glycerol or lysine, led to protein stabilization (complete secondary structure content preservation was detected by FT-IR), higher activity recovery (>90%) and modest autolysis (<10%). High activity recovery (>90%) was also detected with the addition of propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol, saccharides and arginine. Nevertheless, trypsin stored at pH 8.2 with the addition of glycerol or lysine was as efficient as untreated trypsin in the trypsin mass fingerprinting analysis of BSA, suggesting that the cold storage of trypsin in slightly alkaline conditions with the addition of cryoprotectants could prolong its shelf life.",

     "abstract": "This work investigated the operational characteristics of a multi-habitat membrane bioreactor to reveal its internal variation and membrane fouling. During the 100d operating period, a combined anaerobic and aerobic zone gradually formed in a single membrane bioreactor. In the anaerobic zone, DO decreased to nearly zero, while in the aerobic zone, DO value still remained at above 3.1 mg/L, which created beneficial conditions for the removal of nitrogen (TN removal = 87.1%) and phosphorus (TP removal = 90.2%), although the phosphorus removal efficiency decreased in the later stage of operation (TP removal = 44.6%). The increase of torque in the bioreactor accorded with the Boltzmann model (r2 = 0.97891), and the growth trend between torque and apparent viscosity of the fluid was highly consistent, which implied that an on-line torque approach may play an important role in the timely detection of rheological information about the mixed liquor suspended solids. As operational time increased, the size of sludge particles in the aeration zone tended to decrease, and the permanent membrane resistance gradually increased. These relationships revealed the reason for accelerated membrane fouling. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the membrane fouling was mainly caused by a compact fouling layer that formed on the surface of membrane module.",

To promote rapid blood vessel growth in the engineered tissue, we preincubated aortic fragments, as well as, co-cultures of aortic fragments and osteoblast-like cells in matrigel-filled PLGA scaffolds before implantation into the dorsal skinfold chambers of balb/c mice. Despite an acceptable and low inflammatory response, preincubated aortic fragments accelerate early angiogenesis of tissue-engineered constructs; the angiogenesis was found to occur faster than that observed in previous studies. Thus, the time-period for achieving a denser microvascular network could be reduced to half. In addition, co-culture with osteoblasts enhances this angiogenic effect significantly (against preincubated aortic fragments alone). During the preincubation period, aortic fragments begin to form a network of vessel-like structures additionally supported by osteoblast-like cells. After transplantation, further development of a dense microvasculature continues rapidly. Therefore, preincubation of aortic fragments, especially in co-culture with osteoblast-like cells, in 3D extracellular matrices supports the rapid vascularization of tissue-engineered constructs. This method is a promising approach to establish a dense microvascular network in these constructs.",

However, the exact mechanism of the substrate channeling remains unclear. In this work, we used mathematical models to describe the mass transfer in the physical tunnels and to gain further understanding of direct proximity channeling. Simulation with a diffusion-reaction model showed that the reduction of the diffusion distance of intermediates could not cause proximity channeling. A second kinetic model, which considered the physical tunnel as a small sphere capable of preventing diffusion of the intermediate into the bulk, was then constructed. It was used to show that the maximum channeling degree in branched pathways depends on the strength of the side reactions, suggesting that proximity channeling in a physical tunnel is more suitable for a pathway with strong side reactions. On the other hand, for a linear pathway, proximity channeling is more beneficial when the constituting enzymes have relatively low activities and expression levels. Our kinetic model provides a theoretical basis for engineering proximity channeling between sequentially acting enzymes in microbial cell factories and enzyme engineering.",

Owing to the hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions between enzyme and the support, the immobilized CAT exhibits zero leaching, desirable stability and excellent reusability.",

     "abstract": "Sludge biodegradation using thermophilic bacteria is a promising method for sludge treatment. In order to further enhance the efficiency of sludge reduction and hydrolysis, low-frequency ultrasound was used to promote this process. We isolated a thermophilic strain that is effective in secreting extracellular protease to hydrolyze sludge. Then the key ultrasound parameters were selected using the response surface methodology method. After 12 h treatment using thermophilic bacteria with short-time ultrasound promotion, volatile suspended solids (VSS) reduction ratio was achieved 32.8%, which is 41.4% higher than that without ultrasound promotion. Meanwhile the contents of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), protein and carbohydrate were increased by 20.2%, 16.8% and 15.9%, respectively. The composition of dissolved organic matter of sludge products evaluated by excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy demonstrated the promotion effect and eliminated the possibility of the direct sludge degradation caused by ultrasound treatment. Low-frequency ultrasound could effectively promote the thermophilic bacteria hydrolysis to achieve higher sludge biodegradation ratio without directly degrading the raw sludge. The promoted process of sludge biodegradation can further reduce the environmental risk and make sludge to be more readily usable.",

The cell growth along the microfluidic microchambers was observed and the kinetic parameters determined, with values statistically similar to those of conventional batch cultivation. Monod kinetic parameters could also be determined in the microfluidic device using small substrate concentrations. These results show the potential of this microbioreactor to investigate yeast growth with microliter samples and to evaluate experiments in triplicate performed and in parallel.

The system achieved higher chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, volatile solids (VS) reduction, and methane yield than the conventional 20 days HRT single-stage system.

Based on the dependency between energy requirements of the genus Gluconobacter and substrate uptake as well as its constant relationship between gluconic acid production and total substrate uptake, the total substrate concentration profile during the exponential growth phase could be used for estimating μmax without cell concentration measures. In this case, the high selectivity of the strain for glucose in comparison to fructose resulted in no fructose consumption during the batch; so, just using the glucose concentrations data during the exponential phase allow us to obtain an estimation of μmax.

A maximum of 10.4 g L−1 of oligosaccharides was obtained, for a severity factor of 3.6, where 74.5% of the original hemicellulose was solubilized.The process kinetics is presented, modeled (based on the Arrhenius equation) and its scale-up is discussed.

Furthermore, all oligosaccharides are also stable at 100 °C for 1 h, in pH values between 1 and 11, enabling their industrial processing, and at 37 °C for 3 h, in pH values between 1 and 3, thus indicating its potential classification as non-digestible oligosaccharides. The remaining cellulose enriched solids presented an increased enzymatic digestibility (as a function of the autohydrolysis severity) that assures its efficient use in subsequent processes (e.g., bioethanol production).The upgrade route developed in this work in combination to the previously reported use of A. cherimola seed oil for biodiesel production can lead to an integrated zero-waste valorization strategy within the biorefinery framework.",

It is observed that the thermodynamically spontaneous encapsulation in the 4 nm nanopore (ΔG ≈ –40 kJ/mol) is annihilated when the solid diameter narrows down to 3 nm, and that the confined DNA termini directly contact the hydrophobic walls with no solvent slab in-between.

As expected, diffusion is anisotropic, with the pore main axis as the preferred direction, but an in-depth analysis shows that the instantaneous velocity probabilities are essentially identical along the x, y and z directions. The 3D velocity histogram shows a maximum probability located at <v> = 30.8 m/s, twice the observed velocity for a single-stranded three nucleotide DNA encapsulated in comparable armchair geometries (<v> = 16.7 m/s, D = 1.36–1.89 nm).

Bioethanol is the most promising biofuel and can be generated from lignocellulosic biomasses. Forest residues are outside the human food chain and inexpensive raw materials, but they need a previous pretreatment, in order to improve the cellulose accessibility for further bioconversion.The study of bioethanol production from rockrose pretreated by steam explosion (SE) was carried out employing separate enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) or simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) approaches. Saccharification of untreated rockrose attained only 0.9% of sugars yield. However, the steam explosion pretreatment promoted the disruption of interfibrillar surfaces of fibers with partial degradation of lignin thus enhancing the accessibility of polysaccharides toward enzymatic hydrolysis. Alkaline extraction after steam explosion pretreatment of rockrose residue (R-SE-OH) led to the partial removal of lignin, hemicelluloses, and other degradation products from fibre surface allowing an increase of 75% in the glucose yield. Bioethanol production in SSF mode was faster and slightly more efficient process than SHF providing the best results: ethanol concentration of 16.1 g L−1, fermentation efficiency of 69.8% and a yield of 22.1 g ethanol/100 g R-SE-OH.",

     "abstract": "Aerobic granular sludge was successfully developed on a simulated textile effluent with an added azo dye, on a non-tubular sequential batch reactor (SBR), with better granulation results than in a dye-free control SBR fed with the same base medium. The overall performance of the treatment was very good, with high color and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal yields (up to 85% and 80%, respectively). Operation under two sequencing batch cycle strategies, i.e., with a single anaerobic/aerobic reaction phase or under intermittent aeration, showed that the latter generally improved the treatment performance. Under intermittent aeration, biomass accumulation was induced, with faster settling aggregates, leading to a higher COD removal yield. Although a lower decolorization rate was observed in the first 30 min of anaerobic reaction, as compared to the single phase strategy, the overall color removal remained high. This work demonstrates the applicability of the new aerobic granular sludge technology for the treatment of textile effluents.",

The mass transfer coefficient was found to increase with the 0.425 exponent of the superficial gas velocity, at relatively high superficial gas velocity a limiting mass transfer coefficient was reached. The mass transfer coefficient was found to decrease slightly with increasing bed height, ring diameter was found to have a little effect on the rate of mass transfer. The data were correlated for fixed beds placed in the riser and fixed bed placed in the downcomer by dimensionless equations involving the groups J, Re and Fr. Comparison of the present data with previous studies on sparged fixed beds confirmed the superiority of packed bed airlift reactors to packed bubble column reactors.

ATCC 31749 fermentation at various DOTs (5–75%). The estimated kinetic parameters were used to establish models with Origin 8.0.

The combined kinetic models satisfactorily fit the experimental data. The optimal dissolved oxygen profile was obtained using genetic algorithms coupled with iterative dynamic programming algorithms in MATLAB 10b. The optimal dissolved oxygen during curdlan production (20–120 h) was approximately 52% DOT, and the maximum curdlan concentration of 48.5 g/L was obtained at this DOT profile.

The Monod model best simulated the soluble protein and carbohydrate degradation, whereas the Contois model best simulated the particle protein and carbohydrate degradation. The improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) proved to be the best algorithm for parameter estimation.

Both pollutants were completely transformed within a few hours in presence of laccase and ABTS, as well as, for SMX, in presence of AS or SA. The three mediators were consumed during the reaction (no catalytic reactions observed), at a ratio mediator/pollutant between 1.1 and 16 mol/mol. Faster oxidation kinetics were observed at lower pH values, but also higher mediator/pollutant ratios were required. Several transformation products were formed, including cross-coupled products.

The resulting mutant, C. glutamicum SYPS 062-33a, accumulated 65.4% more l-serine (11.0 ± 0.25 g/L) and exhibited higher growth and production of other amino acids (such as l-alanine, l-valine) compared with the parent strain. Interestingly, this mutant harbors a better ability to consume sucrose, which is the main composition of economical molasses.

In addition, a novel mechanism was exploited to enable facile separation of cocultured cells. Rabbit bone-marrow derived MSCs (rMSCs) and rabbit ACs (rACs) were encapsualted in alginate gel beads, respectively. In rACs-laden beads, magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were incorporated. Dynamic coculture was performed in a spinner flask. Fe3O4 nanoparticles had no negative effects on growth of rACs, although a slight inhibition on production of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) by rACs was noticed. An alginate concentration of above 1.8 w/v% was favorable for dynamic culture of rMSCs and rACs. Coculturing rMSCs with rACs in chondrogenic medium in this system demonstrated an improved chondrogenesis than monocultured rMSCs according to GAG quantification, histological staining, and gene expression analysis of collagen I, II and X. However, supplementation of 2% FBS did not show posive effects on chondrogenesis of cocultured rMSCs.

While the large datasets generated by microarrays are a potential goldmine of information, ironically, it is their large size that also makes data-mining a cumbersome task. This can get further complicated by unavoidable batch effects generated when different datasets are combined. Furthermore, gene expression profiles are dependent on combinations of various complex intracellular events and as such identifying the signals primarily related to the phenotype of interest poses a substantial challenge. In this study we addressed these issues by utilizing a workflow that allows adjustment of time-course gene expression datasets for batch effects and incorporates the use of sparse partial least squares analysis to identify specific genes of interest. We were able to identify a set of relevant genes that displayed a strong correlation with cell growth in fed-batch bioreactors under different nutrient compositions. By conducting further biological network analysis, we identified four transcriptional regulators, namely ATP7B, SREBP1, SCAP and INSIG2 that are responsible for regulation of these genes and are likely important drivers for cell growth differences in response to change in nutrient composition.",

Fluid hydrodynamics, oxygen mass transfer coefficient (kLa) and light intensity distribution in the mPBr were first investigated as a function of orbital shaking frequency. High speed video analysis of the shaken wells indicated rapid fluid flow and good mixing while measured kLa values varied between 20 and 80 h−1.

The reusability was achieved by a sandwiched system using secondary rabbit-immunoglobulin antibodies (r-IgGs) tagged with core shell of gold coated iron oxide nanoparticles (r-IgG–Au-Fe3O4), which can be used to regenerate the bioelectrode. A competitive mode was employed, between free and coated AFB1 for fixed concentration of nanoparticle conjugate (r-IgG–Au–Fe3O4). After the competitive interaction, immunoelectrode was washed with phosphate saline buffer (PBS) at pH 7.4 and examined by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance-cyclic voltammetry (EQCM-CV). Under the optimized conditions, the fabricated immunosensor can be used to detect AFB1 quantitatively with a linear range of 0.05 to 5 ng mL−1. For reliability, the fabricated immuno sensor was tested using cereal samples spiked with different concentrations of AFB1. In addition, this immuno electrode displays good reproducibility, and storage stability.

We used a tank reactor with baffles and mechanical stirring with Cowles impellers that can feasibly be up-scaled and allows for the production of homogenous chitosan nanoparticles. First, we explored the effects of temperature on the production of chitosan (CHI)/pentasodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) nanoparticles. We compared the effect of gradual temperature decrease between 40 to 55 °C with the effect of isothermal processes (25, 45 and 55 °C). CHI/TPP nanoparticles produced by the gradual temperature decrease technique had polydispersity indices (PDIs) that were significantly smaller than the nanoparticles produced by isothermal processes. To further control the production process, we employed an experimental design to determine the effects of CHI and TPP concentrations and CHI/TPP mass ratios in the gradual temperature decrease technique. Under all conditions, the sizes of the CHI/TPP nanoparticles were on the nanoscale. Gene delivery capacities of the nanoparticles were evaluated; the plasmid pEGFP-N1 was incorporated (10 and 40% of the chitosan weight) into the nanoparticles and incubated with 293A cells. The in vitro transfection efficiencies were evaluated over 120 h and indicated sustained gene delivery at 10% pDNA. The polyplexes demonstrated some cytotoxicity after 120 h.

This research provided an efficient and controlled approach for the synthesis of ion-exchange beads with high adsorption capacity via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) by grafting methacryloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride to a micron-sized poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (pGMA) matrix. The result showed that grafting of polymeric ion-exchange groups significantly increased the ionic capacity of the micron-sized beads and the adsorption density for γ-globulin. The adsorption capacity for γ-globulin could be optimized by tuning the chain length and the density of the charged polymer grafted onto the beads. The maximal saturated adsorption capacity for γ-globulin reached 808 mg/g wet beads, which is nine times higher than that of non-grafted ion-exchange beads. In a batch kinetics experiment, γ-globulin achieved adsorption equilibriums rapidly (within 10 min). This finding indicates that the protein was involved in a distinct adsorption mechanism during the protein binding to surface-grafted polymer chains.

     "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of oxygen supply on nitrogen removal performance, by applying different oxygen supplies to four SBRs during aeration. That resulted in four different volumetric oxygen transfer coefficients (KLa), which were 3.64 h−1, 10.56 h−1, 16.82 h−1, 28.17 h−1. The research showed that the overall specific nitrogen removal load increased from 0.64 to 3.03 mmolN CmolX−1 h−1, with the increased oxygen supply. Total nitrogen removal reaching above 97%, even with KLa of 10.56 h−1. When oxygen supply increased (KLa increased from 3.64 to 16.82 h−1), the percent of SND decreased, while the rate of SND increased. However, they both decreased when oxygen supply continued to increase (KLa increased to 28.17 h−1). Besides, stronger oxygen supply in aeration preserved more PHB at the start of anoxic stage, which facilitated endogenous denitritation rate from 0.58 to 3.68 mmolN CmolX−1 h−1. In summary, stronger oxygen supply benefits nitrogen removal performance.",

     "abstract": "Dynamic optimization of the state constrained chemical and biochemical engineering problems has always been the research hotspot due to the difficulties of handling constraints. In this paper, a novel approach, CVP–IMOPSO, is presented to tackle this kind of problems, where the original optimization problem is firstly converted into a multi-objective dynamic optimization problem based on a method of handling state constraint; and control vector parameterization (CVP) is then applied to transform the resulting infinite dimensional problem into a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem; finally, an efficient iterative multi-objective particle swarm optimization (IMOPSO), embedded with an region reduction strategy, is proposed to tackle this MOO problem. This strategy reduces the search space gradually during the iteration process so as to further promote the convergence rate and diversity of MOPSO. Three well-known classic optimization problems for chemical and biochemical engineering processes have been tested as illustration, and the detailed comparisons among IMOPSO, MOPSO and NSGA-II are carried out for seven benchmark problems. The research results not only show that the proposed IMOPSO is an efficient algorithm for MOO problems, but also reveal the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Initially, various signal peptides and different types of lipases were evaluated for levels of secreted protein. The mature peptide of GehC (MgehC) fused with the nattokinase signal peptide (aprN SP) yielded recombinant lipase, which was the desirable combination for secretion and stability of GehC produced by B. subtilis PT5(MT1-MgehC).

The maximum average lipid productivity was obtained after 12 days of incubation and it was higher with the sterilized wastewater than with the non-sterilized one (117 g/L/d vs. 91.3 g/L/d), due to the higher biomass concentration. Because of the unexpected increase of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the cultures, second experiment was conducted to characterize the composition of produced DOC in non-sterilized wastewater. Carbohydrate content increased in the liquid phase but decreased in the biomass after nitrogen had been exhausted. After 12 days of incubation, soluble chemical oxygen demand (CODs) was 414 ± 56 mg/L, biomass production was 2.8 ± 0.15 g/L, and lipid content was 30.3 ± 1.2 wt%.

Phenolic acids are bioactive compounds in S. miltiorrhiza, the biosynthesis of which shares the general phenylpropanoid pathway with flavonoids. Chalcone synthase (CHS) is the entry point enzyme of the flavonoid pathway and plays a crucial role in flavonoid biosynthesis. In this study, the transcript of CHS was suppressed through RNAi-mediated silencing, and salicylic acid (SA) was added to the CHS silencing lines and wild-type lines as elicitor to investigate effects of the genetic modification and/or elicitor treatment on the production of phenolic acids in S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots. The results showed that the silencing of CHS enhanced contents of phenolic acids and decreased the accumulation of total flavonoids. The contents of phenolic acids in the SA treated CHS silencing lines were much higher than that in the CHS silencing lines and the SA treated wild-type lines. Our results imply that the substrate flow is directed to the phenolic acids pathway when the flavonoid pathway is interrupted, and combining the genetic modification and elicitor treatment is a new way to improve the production of phenolic acids in S. miltiorrhiza hairy root cultures.",

This model is the first to simulate the production kinetics of fermentative aromas and provides new insight into the synthesis of these volatile compounds.

The maximum rhamnolipid concentration was 6.87 g/L, and the culture broth exhibited a higher emulsification efficiency of 58.3% on n-hexadecane and reduced the surface tension of broth to 22.7 mN/m.

Furthermore, the fluidity of oil had been well improved after degradation. It can be concluded that not only could WCO stimulate the bacterial growth, but also it could enhance the crude oil degradation. Core displacement experiment demonstrates the efficiency of water flooding was just 5.8%, but the microbial flooding produced by Pseudomonas sp.

This study aims at demonstrating the potential of a Centrifugal Partition Chromatography (CPC) apparatus as a novel type of intensified reactor (termed Centrifugal Partition Reactor, CPR) for biphasic (water-organic solvent) enzymatic reactions. The reaction of esterification of oleic acid with n-butanol catalyzed by the Rhizomucor miehei lipase was tested as the model reaction.The influence of rotation speed, flow rate, enzyme and substrate concentrations on esterification reaction were studied. The CPR proved to be efficient to generate sufficient interfacial area (weakly dependent of the flow rate) and sufficient residence time (30 min) to achieve good conversion (85%). Also, increasing rotation speed of the CPR surprisingly decreased performances, probably due to very specific inner hydrodynamics. For a given configuration, the productivity of the CPR (40.5 g h−1 L−1) was found to be more favorable than the conventional batch process (21.6 g h−1 L−1). Steady state operation of the reactor at 22 °C, (i.e., constant conversion at the output, see Fig. 8), was reached after about 2 residence times and lasted for 24 h. After 24 h, the output conversion slowly decreased due to the low intrinsic stability of the enzyme at room temperature.The promising results obtained in this study are a good incentive to promote the CPR as a competitive innovative technology for operating continuous two phase enzymatic reactions.",

The results show that reducing the BSA concentration made the protein structure more unfolded so that it enhanced the protein aggregation induced by the gas-liquid interface. In foam fractionation, the BSA aggregates were mainly formed in the desorption of the BSA molecules from the gas-liquid interface. Their formation was closely related to the BSA enrichment ratio. In the concentration from 0.05 g/L to 0.20 g/L, the highly unfolded BSA structure and the high enrichment jointly resulted in the formation of insoluble aggregates.",

YlCR showed a broad substrate spectrum toward aldehydes, ketones, α- and β-keto esters. Among them, α-chloroacetophenone was found to be efficiently converted to (R)-2-chloro-1-phenylethol, the precursor for the synthesis of anti-depressants and α- or β-adrenergic drugs. Using 2-propanol as the hydrogen donor, α-chloroacetophenone (50 mM) was reduced with the recombinant E. coli, and the obtained conversation and enantiomeric excess (e.e) were both 99%. When the α-chloroacetophenone concentration was up to 200 mM, the conversion achieved 63%, and the e.e was always 99%. The present study serves as a valuable guidance for the future applications of this versatile biocatalyst.",

In this study, a high throughput, tablet-sized, low cost photobioreactor, herein referred as “PhotoBiobox”, was fabricated and tested for screening and culture optimization of microalgae suitable for biomass and biodiesel production, and CO2 sequestration. PhotoBiobox is equipped with a LED array and photo gradient filter offering different light intensities. PhotoBiobox was fabricated to screen and cultivate several microbial strains in 96-well plate in wide temperature range and CO2 atmosphere. To test its efficacy, a total of 12 microalgal strains were isolated from Korean freshwaters, identified and screened for high growth and lipid accumulation potential. Among the 12 strains, Parachlorella sp., JD076 showed highest growth rate, remarkable stability and tolerance to different temperature regimes. Optimization experiments using PhotoBiobox revealed that this strain had optimum temperature range and light intensity of 24–25 °C and 400 μmol m−2 s−1, respectively, with high growth rate and lipid content in 5% CO2 condition. The screening and optimization of culture conditions using PhotoBiobox took just 15 days, in total, which could radically reduce both screening costs and time. PhotoBiobox can be used as a screening and optimization reactor in several areas of microbiology and cell biology, while serving as a prototype for furthering research on miniaturization in this field.",

     "abstract": "Wax esters are fine chemicals which are produced in low volume but are highly priced with varied industrial applications. They are formulated in numerous personal care products due to their excellent emollient properties. The conventional technology for the preparation of wax esters are based on reaction between long chain carboxylic acids and alcohols at high temperatures in presence of a strong catalyst. This process is unselective and the removal of used catalyst and byproducts requires several stages which increases the production cost. Enzyme technology is an alternative which is eco friendly and requires lesser stages of purification. The present study aims at the enzymatic preparation of wax esters like dibehenyl adipate and dibehenyl sebacate in presence of immobilized lipases from different microbial origin e.g., RM-IM, TL IM, NS40013 and NS 435. Various reaction parameters like temperature, reaction time, mole ratio, enzyme concentration and solvent selection were optimized. The work clearly indicates NS 435 as the most efficient enzyme and can be recycled for 20 times without significant change in product quality. Trial run was given in a packed bed bioreactor using NS435 which produced 89% and 91% of dibehenyl adipate and dibehenyl sebacate, respectively.",

The chimeric sensor protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by affinity chromatography. Following binding of zinc, FRET ratio increased with increasing the Zn2+ concentration. Affinity mutants were constructed with binding constants ranging from 50 μM to 1 mM. In vitro analysis with bacterially purified sensor showed that it is specific for Zn2+ and responds only weakly to Cd2+ with no response for other biological metal ions.

Draft genome sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of the complete degradation pathway for atrazine and phenol. Gene annotation results indicated that atrazine was degraded via the chlorohydrolase route with atzA/B/C/D/E/F genes, while phenol was converted to catechol via a multicomponent phenol hydroxylase from the phc pathway. Genes from the ortho pathway were responsible for the further biodegradation of catechol; a result that was confirmed by enzyme assays. A model to describe the growth and biodegradation of atrazine, phenol and related compounds was applied and fit to a series of aerobic batch degradation experiments. Kinetic studies revealed that EGD-AKN5 showed potential to degrade both phenol and atrazine simultaneously using phenol as the carbon source and atrazine as nitrogen source. Gene expression studies indicated a longer lag phase for expression of genes from the atrazine degradation pathway, when compared to expression of phenol and catechol degradation.",

For this purpose, autoclave sterile OP for the elimination of d-limonene and natural microflora was evaluated with regard to yeast viability, nutrient consumption and cell ability to produce flavour active compounds. Non-sterile OP was also used to follow pros and cons of the sterilization process. Yeast cells showed better growth performance under sterilized process conditions, than under non-sterilized ones. In the first case, the enhanced de novo synthesis of “fruity” esters was demonstrated (48.7, 25.2, 9.3, 6.3 and 4.5 mg/kg of fermented OP for isoamyl acetate, ethyl dodecanoate, decanoate, octanoate and phenyl ethyl acetate, respectively, after 72 h). Yeast cells exhibited accelerated synthesis of ethyl hexanoate (154.2 mg/kg OP at 48 h). Biotransformation of naturally occurring aroma compounds by yeast may be considered in this process. The proposed process, resulting in high yields of industrially important volatile aroma esters (total of ∼250 mg/kg OP), could be applied to a sustainable biorefinery for the valorization of OP waste.",

The critical micelle concentration of the produced rhamnolipid was only 27 mg/L and its emulsification index against n-hexadecane reached around 59%. Moreover, it reduced the surface tension of water from 71.8 mN/m to 24.1 mN/m and the interfacial tension against n-hexadecane from 29.4 mN/m to 0.9 mN/m. Results of biosurfactant stability show the rhamnolipid was effective when the salinity was lower than 8% and pH value ranged from 4 to 10, and it was quite thermostable based on thermal gravity analysis. Furthermore, it maintained high surface activity even after incubation under extreme conditions i.e., pH of 4.0, salinity of 8% and temperature of 80 °C for half a month. Based on free fatty acids metabolism analysis, Pseudomonas SWP-4 consumed palmitic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid chiefly.

However, due to the strict d-enantioselectivity of most hydantoinase enzymes, the process is less efficient for l-amino acid production. We present a new chemo-enzymatic cascade reaction for natural and non-natural l-amino acid production from racemic mixtures of 5-monosubstituted hydantoins. This system comprised the following enzymes: d-hydantoinase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens BQL9, hydantoin racemase 1 from A. tumefaciens C58 and l-N-carbamoylase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus CECT43, together with N-succinyl-amino acid racemase from G. kaustophilus CECT4264. This latter presents catalytic promiscuity and racemizes N-carbamoyl-amino acids. This activity avoids the accumulation of N-carbamoyl-d-amino acid in the reaction due to the strict d-enantioselectivity of the hydantoinase. The optimum pH for the system proved to be 8.0, whereas optimum temperature range was 50–65 °C, with the maximum reaction rate at 60 °C. The metal ion cobalt was added directly to the reaction mixture (end concentration 1 mM), but in the case of d-hydantoinase, overexpression in presence of 0.5 mM Co2+ was also necessary. The enzymatic cascade reaction produced different optically pure l-amino acids by dynamic kinetic resolution, achieving 100% conversion even at high substrate concentrations (100 mM) with no noticeable inhibition. This total conversion demonstrates that the “double-racemase hydantoinase process” upgrades the classical “hydantoinase process” for natural and non-natural l-amino acid production.",

To reveal the metabolic differences between these two culture methods, the intracellular metabolic profile characterization of Gluconacetobacter xylinus was investigated using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. A total of 79 intracellular metabolites in G. xylinus were detected and quantified. Trehalose was mainly responsible for the discrimination among different cultural groups. Coupled with metabolic network, BC production was divided into two stages in agitated culture. At the first stage, glucose was more converted to gluconic acid at high rotational speeds, resulting in a low conversion rate of glucose to BC. At the second stage, gluconic acid acted as carbon source pool for BC synthesis under glucose-limited conditions. However, the accumulation of self-protection metabolites (trehalose, amino acids and gluconic acid) on the 2nd day at 280 rpm branches much carbon source from BC synthesis, resulting in the inhibition of BC synthesis. The highest conversion rate of glucose to BC was observed in static culture, attributing to the inhibition of Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and the accumulation of by-products. These might be the possible reasons that G. xylinus in static and agitated cultures gave distinct BC yields.",

The alternative mechanism suggests partial enzymatic hydrolysis of 2, whereupon the products initiate fusion 1 + 2. Three lipases (porcine pancreatic, Mucor javanicus and Yarrowia lipolytica) did not hydrolyze 2, but significantly accelerated condensations 1 + 2 and 1 + 3 (3 is not hydrolyzable), thereby corroborating promiscuous enzymatic activity. Main conversion took place within the active site (based on competitive inhibition by caffeic acid). Yet, the “active” Ser residue of lipases was unimportant, because its covalent modification did not affect condensation. The reaction (particularly 1 + 3 condensation) was to some extent promoted by unspecific residues of lipase, as well as albumin and simple proton acceptors. Spontaneous condensation in water/ethanol surprisingly revealed kinetics with substrate saturation. We explained this depart from linearity by a two-step steady state mechanism including deprotonation of the active hydrogen substrate 3H by polar solvent, followed by direct collision of a temporary complex solvent ·H+·3– with 1. Similar mechanism with a more sophisticated binding of substrates was conjectured for the lipases.",

Therefore, investigation of MICP in more realistic conditions is necessary. This study presents optimization of MICP through denitrification in minimal nutrient conditions. To optimize their MICP performances, we isolated two strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Diaphorobacter nitroreducens, by following an application oriented selection procedure. Upon performance optimization, in 2 days, D. nitroreducens and P. aeruginosa precipitated 14.1 and 18.9 g CaCO3/g NO3-N, respectively. Repetitive CaCO3 precipitation was also achieved from a single inoculum in both 2 days and 3 weeks intervals. Selected strains and the process were further evaluated for three MICP applications: (1) Ca2+ removal from paper mill wastewater (2) soil reinforcement, (3) crack repair in concrete. Overall, denitrification was found to be an effective process to remove Ca2+ from paper mill wastewater. P. aeruginosa and D. nitroreducens could be introduced as potential candidates for soil and concrete applications due to their enhanced precipitation yields, resilience and performance under minimal nutrient conditions.",

Mutation of Trp into Ala or Val led to complete loss of activity, while replacement of Trp by Phe had little effect on the activity and enantioselectivity. Structural and energetic analysis demonstrated that π–π stacking interactions were formed between the residue W20 and the substrate, as well as the residues W20 and F141, which facilitated the stabilization of substrate at the transition state. Moreover, the different probabilities of the parallel–shifted stacking interaction between the residue 20 and R-/S-enantiomer were found related to the enantioselectivity. Thus, it could be concluded that the π–π stacking interaction between the residue W20 and the substrate was crucial in the determination of enzymatic catalytic performance.

A large array of ILs and GBs was investigated, revealing than only the more hydrophobic and fluorinated ILs are able to form ABS. For these systems, the phase diagrams, tie-lines, tie-line lengths, and critical points were determined at 25 °C. The ABS were then evaluated as alternative liquid–liquid extraction strategies for two amino acids (l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan). The single-step extraction efficiencies for the GB-rich phase range between 22.4 and 100.0% (complete extraction). Contrarily to the most conventional IL-salt ABS, in most of the systems investigated, the amino acids preferentially migrate for the more biocompatible and hydrophilic GB-rich phase. Remarkably, in two of the studied ABS, l-phenylalanine completely partitions to the GB-rich phase while l-tryptophan shows a preferential affinity for the opposite phase. These results show that the extraction efficiencies of similar amino acids can be tailored by the design of the chemical structures of the phase-forming components, creating thus new possibilities for the use of IL-based ABS in biotechnological separations.",

In this study, Zeta potential measurement, microscopy examination and classical DLVO theory (named after Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey and Overbeek) analysis were used to explore the flocculability of microalgae induced by bacterial γ-PGA broth bioflocculant. Microalgae flocculation could be significantly improved by modifying ionic strength of the microalgae suspension, lowering pH value and bioflocculant addition due to the stronger attraction interactions between microalgal cells. In the present study, both the pH reduction with the bioflocculant induced better the flocculation process compared to the modification of ionic strength of the microalgae suspension in the presence of the bioflocculant. The DLVO theory indicated that when the bioflocculant was introduced, the total interaction energy decreased sharply, resulting in higher flocculation efficiency (>96 %) at a separation distance of 5 nm and shorter settling time (from 2 h to 10 min) compared with that obtained only by reducing the initial pH. The microalgae interaction energy was found to be dependent on the Zeta potential. This study provided a detailed interpretation of conceivable mechanism of microalgae bioflocculation by γ-PGA broth.",

Lipopeptide biosurfactant was produced by hydrocarbon degrading and biosurfactant producing strain isolated from creosote contaminated soil. The isolate CN2 was identified as Bacillus subtilis using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In a used motor oil degradation assay carried out in an Erlenmeyer flask using microbial consortium, the biosurfactant enhanced the degradation of used motor oil polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) components up to 82% in 18 days of incubation, more than twofold compared to the degradation with no biosurfactant supplementation. The biosurfactant was tested for its oil recovery potential and it recovered 85% of used motor oil from contaminated sand in 24 h. Tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis showed that the biosurfactant produced is lipopeptidal of molecular mass 1472 Da. The lipopeptide showed emulsifying activity against a variety of hydrocarbons and attained emulsion indices of 81 and 84% with Hexane and cyclohexane, respectively. The lipopeptide showed stability over a temperature range of (25–125 °C), pH range of (5–12) and salinity range of (5–20%, w/v).

At the steady stage, COD removal efficiency, VFA concentration, and biogas production were approximately 85%, 158 mg/L and 1.65 L/L d, respectively. The color removal efficiency was from 77% to 90% in the whole experiment.

The external circulation system not only shortened the startup time of the IC reactor treating wastewater, but also improved the pollutants removal in anaerobic reactor with a reasonable hydraulic upflow velocity. However, excessive hydraulic upflow velocity (40.9 m/h) caused the granular sludge disintegration and a decline in COD removal.

Pretreatment of the microalga with AES-Bt for 24 h led to an increase in the extracted oil content from 34.2% to 44.3% (dry weight basis), representing an enhanced oil extraction efficiency (ηoil) of 29.3%. The ηoil value remained within the range of 26.3–33.2% when increasing the algae biomass loading from 5.0 g/l to 40.0 g/l (or decreasing AES-to-algae ratio from 200 to 25 ml/g), while the maximum ηoil value was obtained when an AES-to-algae ratio of 50 ml/g was used. Finally, reuse of AES-Bt agent was also examined. The results show that the enhanced lipid extraction efficiency slightly decreased as the number of recycling times increased. However, after being recycled and reused for four times, the AES-Bt agents could still effectively disrupt the cell wall, leading to around 92% of the original oil extraction efficiency that was obtained when the AES-Bt agents were first used. This study demonstrates that biological cell-disruptive pretreatment using the AES-Bt agents could be an effective and environmentally friendly means of increasing oil extraction efficiency with microalgae.",

The communities of aerobic denitrifying bacteria in the temperature downshift period were all highly organized functionally, and they were relatively stably across the temperature gradient. These results will enhance understanding regarding the microbial ecology of aerobic denitrifiers in mixed cultures, leading to a more effective controlling of aerobic denitrification process during temperature transition states.",

For further comparison of hydrated and non-hydrated systems, kinetic runs were performed at several ibuprofen initial concentrations (20–100 g L−1) and temperatures (50–80 °C). In all cases, the formation of an emulsion was observed and analyzed by focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and turbidimetry.

The device received concentrated activated sludge from two different ports: a horizontal port that transferred activated sludge with a jet flow via a nozzle and a side port that aspirated activated sludge with air. An investigation into the manner in which activated sludge was supplied indicated that the activated sludge conveyed by horizontal jet flow with aspiration from the elevated side port provided the highest degree of activated sludge reduction in the mixed liquor suspended solid (MLSS). The degree of reduction was 12.2% and the viable microorganisms decreased by 42.8%. The injection ratio R was defined as the amount of activated sludge from the side port to that of the nozzle. We found an optimum value of three with a MLSS reduction of 40%. The eluted constituents from the damaged cells or the intracellular compounds were biodegraded by the intact activated sludge.

How the methanogenic community structure during fermentation corresponds to the chemical composition of the size fractions was determined.Biogas production strongly negatively correlated with the biogas production rate constants (kbiogas) due to differences in the availability of organic substances. Microorganisms in the 20–80 mm size fraction produced the most biogas (252 ± 11 L/kg TS, kbiogas = 0.16 ± 0.04 day−1), which had the highest methane content (ca. 50%), probably because this size fraction had the highest organics content and the most diverse microbial community. In this size fraction, Methanosarcinaceae (acetoclastic microorganisms) and Methanobacteriaceae (hydrogenotrophic microorganisms) were more abundant than in other fractions. The 0–20 mm size fraction produced the least amount of biogas (65 ± 8 L/kg TS); however, its kbiogas was the highest (0.32 ± 0.05 day−1), suggesting that organic matter was easily accessible to the microorganisms. Although the 0–20 mm size fraction is considered to be a mineral fraction that can be used for recultivation, the results of this study suggest that this fraction should be processed first to avoid environmental contamination.",

In a first step, a general kinetic model [Syst. Anal. Model.

This circumvents the tedious problems of choosing the kinetic structure and providing initial parameter values on a trial-and-error basis. In a second step, the general kinetic model can be easily transformed into the general extended Monod formalism. The global identification of the nonlinear model is finally performed based on the results of the previous steps. The model and the experimental field (fed-batch culture experiments using hybridoma cell line HB-58) presented in Amribt et al. [Biochem. Eng.

The proposed systematic procedure leads to the identification of a model structure with similar complexity but whose parameter values present lower variation coefficients. The identified model successfully reproduces the dynamics associated with substrates consumption (glucose and glutamine), metabolites production (lactate and ammonia) and cell growth.",

This screening method was applied to modular capsomeres presenting peptide epitopes from the rotavirus spike protein VP8 subunit domain, engineered as a next-generation rotavirus vaccine candidate. Among various additives tested, non-ionic detergents, such as Triton X-100, Tween-80 and Tween-20, were able to stabilize modular capsomeres, either alone or in combination with l-arginine, as confirmed with high-resolution size exclusion chromatography. Results demonstrate that tailoring the nature of the environment surrounding self-assembling proteins using small organic molecules can enhance the bioprocessing of modular vaccine capsomeres. The developed screening method potentially provides a powerful approach for rapid tailoring of processing conditions specific to antigenic modules displayed on next-generation recombinant capsomere and VLP vaccines, for low-cost vaccine delivery at global scale.",

     "abstract": "This paper deals with steady-state analysis and design of bioreactors consisting of a number of completely stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) in series. The study is confined to one consumed (substrate) and one consuming constituent (biomass). The specific microbial growth rate is assumed to be described by Monod kinetics. The death of biomass is assumed to be negligible. Two optimal design problems for a large number of CSTRs in series are studied: to minimize the effluent substrate concentration for a given total volume, and to minimize the total volume for a given effluent substrate concentration. As an appealing alternative to solve these problems numerically, it is proposed to consider the asymptotic case where the number of CSTRs tends to infinity. This is shown to correspond to one CSTR in series with a plug flow reactor (PFR). A CSTR with a sufficient large volume is needed to avoid wash-out of the biomass. The main result is that both design problems for the CSTR + PFR configuration have the same solution with respect to the optimal volume of the CSTR, which is given as an explicit function of the incoming substrate concentration, the volumetric flow rate and the coefficients of the Monod growth rate function. Numerical results indicate that the plug flow approach may be used as a feasible design procedure even for a reasonably low number of CSTRs in series.",

The degradation of alkane based on both adsorption and biodegradation by immobilized A. venetianus was observed, where 93.3%, 77.7% and 24.0% of tetradecane (400 mg L−1) were removed by the immobilized cells, free cells and bagasse after 36 h incubation, respectively. Additionally, alkane (C10–C25) in diesel was effectively degraded by the immobilized cells, of which 800 mg L−1 of alkane was completely degraded after 60 h. Furthermore, results showed: (1) tetradecane served as the optimal carbon source at the concentration of 100 mg L−1; and (2) cells immobilization reached its peak efficiency with the cells-to-bagasse ratio of 0.5 mgcell g−1bagasse. Cells strongly immobilized on bagasse retained a high degradation rate of 77.6% after shaking at 1500 rpm. Bagasse protected the cells from pollution stress including cadmium (Cd(II)) and phenanthrene. After 8 reuse cycles, immobilized cells became more stable and efficient.

Laccase from Trametes versicolor was selected as a candidate enzyme due to its wide substrate specificity and its use of molecular oxygen as an oxidant. Phenol was selected as a target substrate. A four-parameter kinetic model was developed based on the known reactions of laccase. The model was applied to 30 sets of data collected from batch reactions conducted at pH 5 and 25 °C over a three hour period. Initial phenol concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 50 μM and applied enzyme concentrations ranged from 0.12 to 2.5 μM. The model demonstrated its utility for predicting the quantities of enzyme and reaction times required to achieve desired levels of oxidation of phenol for varying initial concentrations.

Two acclimated sludges were obtained by two-different acclimating conditions which exposed to influent COD/NO2−-N ratios of 25 with high COD loading rate and 5 with low COD loading rate during acclimation periods (referred to as AS25 and AS5). AS25 added reactors showed the relatively high methanogenic and denitrifying performances compared to AS5 added reactors. The results obtained in AS25 added reactors showed comparable results to different studies which used liquid substrates.

In this study, respirometry of heterogeneous media is advised as a valuable technique for characterizing mass transport and biological activity of H2S-oxidizing biofilms attached on two packing materials from operative biotrickling filters. Controlled flows of liquid and H2S-containing air were recirculated through a closed heterogeneous respirometer allowing a more realistic estimation of the biofilm activity by the experimental evaluation of the oxygen uptake rate (OUR). Specific maximum OUR of 23.0 and 38.5 mmol O2 (g biomass min)−1 were obtained for Pall rings and polyurethane foam, respectively. A mathematical model for the determination of kinetic-related parameters such as the maximum H2S elimination capacity and morphological properties of biofilm (i.e., thickness and fraction of wetted area of packing bed) was developed and calibrated. With the set of parameters obtained, the external oxygen mass transport to the wetted biofilm was found to limit the global H2S biofiltration capacity, whereas the non-wetted biofilm was the dominant route for the gaseous O2 and H2S mass transfer to the biofilm. Oxygen diffusion rate was the limiting step in the case of very active biofilms.",

Complementary to conventional enzyme engineering techniques based on only natural amino acids, we hypothesized that the site-specific incorporation of a non-natural amino acid in vivo into an enzyme can be used to re-design the active site for the altered substrate specificity. To test our hypothesis, we introduced the non-natural amino acid L-2-naphthylalanine (2Nal) into the active site of the model enzyme murine dihydrofolate reductase (mDHFR). We explored whether the substrate specificity of the enzyme could be switched from the good substrate dihydrofolate (DHF) to the poor substrate folate (FOL). We used two protein design programs (RosettaLigand and RosettaDesign) to calculate ligand docking and conformational stability, respectively, for the evaluation of multiples sites in the mDHFR. From the calculations, position 31 was predicted as an optimal 2Nal incorporation site. One mDHFR variant containing 2Nal at position 31 (mDHFR2Nal31) was expressed in the Escherichia coli expression host cells equipped with the engineered yeast phenylalanyl-tRNA and phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase pair. As expected, the kinetic assays of purified mDHFR variant revealed that mDHFR2Nal31 has the enhanced binding affinity toward FOL and also exhibits 7.6-fold enhanced catalytic efficiency of FOL over DHF compared to mDHFRWT.",

The analysis of metabolic flux showed that both of lactic acid and acetic acid severely inhibited the fermentation. Only 30.11 mM and 66.85 mM glucose were consumed in 24 h under the initial concentration of 444 mM lactic acid and 415 mM acetic acid, respectively. The activity of the cell was dramatically decreased by the organic acid, furthermore, the production of 1,3-propanediol and lactic acid was impeded. The adsorption properties of anion exchange resin (D301G) were investigated to facilitate the removal of organic acid in situ during fermentation. The resin D301G was added at initial and during fermentation of 12 h, respectively, which showed different function on the metabolism of L. reuteri. Initial addition of resin increased the biomass of fermentation, while the glucose consuming and the 1,3-propanediol producing did not change significantly. The resin added at 12 h promoted the conversion of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol due to the NADH accumulation caused by the metabolic flux migration to acetic acid pathway, while the biomass decreased in small amount.",

The Flavourzyme®/wheat gluten process was comprehensively characterized in the enzyme membrane reactor. Critical factors for the enzyme stability were the temperature, pump stress and enzyme leakage through the membrane. The hydrolysis and process conditions were optimized to increase the space–time yield.

Alkaline delignification was much conspicuous in lignin-rich macrophyte (Potamogeton maackianus) as compared with lignin-poor macrophyte (Egeria densa). Ferulic acid, which is cross-linked with lignin polymer and polysaccharides, remarkably declined with increase of NaOH loading rate. It suggests that alkali removed lignin–ferulate complex from the surface of polysaccharides. The CH4 yield of pre-treated P. maackianus was 243 mL g-VS−1, which is 51% higher than the un-treated (161 mL g-VS−1). In contrast, the CH4 yield of pre-treated E. densa was 24% higher than the un-treated.

     "abstract": "The growth rate and desulfurization capacity accumulated by the cells during the growth of Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8 under different fluid dynamic conditions in a stirred and sparged tank bioreactor have been studied. Hydrodynamic conditions were changed using different stirrer speeds and gas flow rates. It was observed that the growth was strongly dependent on the stirrer speed employed. Oxygen transfer limitation was observed at low stirrer speeds (from 100 to 250 rpm). In contrast, at higher stirrer speeds, cell damage was caused by hydrodynamic stress in the turbulent bulk of the broth, yielding again a decrease in growth for stirrer speeds higher than 450 rpm. Moreover, increasing the agitation from 100 to 450 rpm has a positive influence on the development of the desulfurization capacity of the cells during growth, yet this capacity shows a dramatic decrease for higher stirrer speeds. Nevertheless, the change of the air flow rate hardly has any influence on the growth rate and no hydrodynamic stress effect has been detected between 1 and 10 L min−1. A regime analysis of the characteristic times for oxygen mass transfer, oxygen uptake and mixing under different agitation conditions has been made. It was found that the minimum stirrer speed necessary for a satisfactory performance of the bioreactor from the point of view of the cells oxygen demand was 350 rpm, while at stirrer speeds over 450 rpm, growth rate and desulfurization capacity are both negatively affected.",

The selective lipopeptide production is strongly influenced by the processing conditions and the limiting nutrient sources such as oxygen and nitrogen during a fermentation process.

The optimal conditions of shake flasks studies of 340 mL medium volume (in 1 L conical flask), 4.67% v/v inoculum volume and 121 rpm agitation speed resulted in a total lipopeptide concentration of 5.34 ± 0.1 g L−1, with more selectivity toward fengycin of 74.1%. Among the three rational approaches investigated to recreate these optimal conditions in a 3.7 L stirred tank bioreactor, the strategy, submerged aeration followed by surface aeration effectively reproduced the optimal conditions of shaker flasks resulting in a total lipopeptide concentration of 4.94 ± 0.15 g L−1, with fengycin selectivity of 71%.

In this study, the influence of liquid flow field patterns on morphology, broth rheology, mass transfer and glucoamylase production was investigated by applying two different configurations with radial (Ruston Turbine, RT) and axial (Wide-blade hydrofoil upward-pumping, WHu) flow impellers. It was found that empirical correlations for averaged quantities, such as the mass transfer coefficient and viscosity, cannot reasonably explain the observations. Therefore, numerical simulation was carried out to study the detailed characteristics of local field in lab-scale bioreactors. The results showed, under similar glucose and oxygen uptake rates, that the WHu configuration formed relatively homogeneous viscosity and mass transfer fields, while the RT configuration was accompanied with significant heterogeneities. Under these conditions, the fraction of active mycelia in pellets could be highly correlated with enzyme production, and a novel parameter (Active Part Percentage, APP) was defined to introduce the effects of flow field on pelletized morphology. The WHu impellers facilitated the formation of pellets and hairy structures, with a higher APP of the pellets. As a result, the culture with the axial flow impeller configuration exhibited a larger glucoamylase production rate (+25%) and product yield on sugar (+23%) and yield on energy (+60%) in comparison to the radial flow impeller. Computational fluid models were proposed to in-depth understand such results based on local mass transfer and viscosity values, since the average values are similar over the entire fermentation processes.",

Spin-coated chips were used for antibody (Ab) immobilization in order to investigate the influence of COOH surface concentration on dengue virus detection efficiency in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiment. Successful immobilization of Ab was achieved by two different techniques: (1) physical adsorption; and (2) covalent immobilization by carbodiimide coupling between the surface COOH groups and amine functionalities of dengue Ab molecules. Produced polymer coatings were characterized with surface spectroscopy techniques (Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS) and water-in-air contact angle (WCA) measurements. In particular, this research concentrated on the aging effect on the availability and activity of surface COOH groups. For that reason, WCA and Ab immobilization (ELISA) experiments were repeated on coated biochips after 3, 6 and 9 months of storage.

The flow behavior of shaken flasks was examined using the particle image velocimetry technique (PIV) to capture the mixing dynamics for a range of operating conditions. The velocity fields and turbulent intensities were obtained. For all cases, the chaotic-like fluid motion increased with the orbital speed of the shaker. The behavior of conventional, coiled and baffled flasks was analyzed for shaking speeds ranging from 25 to 250 rpm; at high shaking rates the turbulent distribution increased for each flask configuration but the average value differed significantly. The highest turbulent intensity was found for the one-baffle arrangement, which is about 25% larger than the other configurations. We found that the highest turbulent production for all the different geometric conditions occurred at a shaking speed of about 150 rpm, which is in good agreement with the findings reported for the production of bacterial cultures at such shaking rate.",

Changing settings of the controller, the tON/tOFF time ratio, adjusted the speed in which the ammonium hydroxide was added for pH control and the sole nitrogen source. Setting the tON/tOFF ratio to 0.5/0.5, 0.5/10 and 0.5/15 resulted in a decrease in the growth rate as the tOFF value increased. Therefore, the design allows running the culture at lower growth rates in a controlled way. Two high cell density cultures with tON/tOFF ratio of 0.5/10 and 0.5/20 were also fed ammonia with the same controller. Setting tON/tOFF at 0.5/10 and 0.5/20 led to an increase in final biomass and protein as the tOFF decreased. A metabolic model assessed the effect of nitrogen-limitation in high cell density cultures on the yeast metabolism. Model results show that fluxes of intracellular reactions such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic cycle and the pentose-phosphate pathway are higher at tON/tOFF = 0.5/10. Additionally, higher sensitivity of growth and protein production to oxygen at tON/tOFF = 0.5/10 proves that oxygen limitation led to higher protein production in this case.",

An investigation was undertaken to identify sources of variability. First, chemical/biological contaminants, including cleaning procedures, gas source/quality, compromised bioreactor parts and mycoplasma contamination, were ruled out. Second, we tested a gradient of sparging rates and observed that early post-inoculation cell death increased with the gas flow rate. While bubbles are known to cause cell damage, this effect was not previously observed at the high sparging rate used. Third, because hydrodynamic damage appeared to be responsible for cell death, we tested the addition of increased levels of surfactant Pluronic F-68 (PF-68), which reduces cell-to-bubble attachment and lowers dynamic surface tension, to the new CDM lots. This restored the viable cell density and viability profiles. Measurement of the dynamic surface tension of the CDM lots employed in this study indicated variability up to 8% between CDM lots supplemented with different PF-68 lots. In summary, our observations suggest that the raw material quality of PF-68 lots can alter the ability to lower the surface tension in chemically-defined cell culture media and significantly impact performance of CHO cell cultures in sparged bioreactors.",

In this paper, the growth of Cupriavidus necator DSM4058 in mineral medium containing methanol in a range 0–125 g/L is reported. It was found that methanol tested at any concentration had a negative influence on growth. However, the reduction in specific growth rate could be predicted by neither substrate nor product inhibition equations, and so a model, based on a saturation equation was developed and is presented here. The model is shown to fit particularly well, not only with the C. necator data but also with several sets of data extracted from publications based on other micro-organisms. It was found that the model successfully predicted the data with regression coefficients of over 96%, regardless of micro-organism or particular alcohol inhibitor.",

The cells immobilized on a hollow fiber membrane composed of a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer exhibited a 2–4-fold increase in CGTase excretion, over a 100% increase in plasmid stability and 28-60% reduction in cell lysis compared with free cells. Hence, the immobilization of E. coli using a hollow fiber membrane was demonstrated to increase enzyme excretion and cell stability.",

In this study the enzymatic degradation of corn- and wheat DDGS was evaluated, in vitro, by use of four xylanases from two different glycoside hydrolase families, GH10 and GH11, along with protease and phytase. Wheat DDGS showed the highest degree of enzymatic degradation due to a lower degree of cell wall complexity compared with that of corn DDGS. For corn DDGS,the combination of xylanase and protease yielded the highest degree of enzymatic degradation, indicating close association of arabinoxylan and protein within the cell wall matrix. Collectively, the GH10xylanase degraded DDGS more efficiently than the GH11 xylanases, due to the complexity of the DDGS substrate and the substrate affinity of the GH10xylanase. The current in vitro results indicate a high potential of xylanase in combination with protease to efficiently degrade DDGS and promote nutrient release in diets for non-ruminant animals.",

The conversion of CO2 implies a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrogen oxidizing bacteria such as Cupriavidus necator have the ability to store PHB using CO2 as a carbon source, i.e., through an autotrophic conversion. In this study, a mathematical model based on mass balances was set up to describe autotrophic PHB production. The model takes into account the stoichiometry and kinetics of biomass growth and PHB formation as well as physical transfer from the gas phase to the liquid fermentation broth. The developed model was calibrated and validated based on independent experimental datasets from literature, obtained for C. necator. The obtained simulation results accurately described the dynamics of autotrophic biomass growth and PHB production. The effect of oxygen (O2) and/or nitrogen stress conditions, as well as of the gas mixture composition in terms of O2 and hydrogen (H2) was investigated through scenario analysis. As major outcome, a higher maximum PHB concentration was obtained under oxygen stress conditions compared to nitrogen stress conditions. At high O2 fractions in the gas mixture, which would result in H2 limitation before O2 limitation, PHB production can be increased by applying nitrogen stress. The effect of the reactor type was assessed through comparing a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with an air-lift fermentor. The developed model forms the basis for future design with minimum experimentation of suitable control strategy aiming at a high PHB production.",

This innovative research combines the potential of VH33, which uses a different glucose transport allowing efficient growth and lower acetate production, for pDNA biosynthesis with a validated factorial design. This work achieved higher plasmid yields of 81.77 μg pDNA/mL, when compared with other results for similar assays which reached about 40 μg pDNA/mL.

The purpose of this study was to develop and optimize an in-situ restoring strategy based on hydroxylamine (NH2OH) dosing and solids retention time (SRT) control for the deteriorated CPNA process. Results showed that the 0.55 kgN m−3 d−1 of nitrogen removal rate could be recovered by 20 mgNH2OH L−1 of hydroxylamine dosing and 40 days of SRT control, the nitrate concentration in effluent was decreased from the highest 548.4 mgN L−1 during deterioration to 65.1 mgN L−1 after restoration, and the ratio of NO3−-Nproduced/NH4+-Nconsumed in one SBR cycle was reduced from the highest 87.0% to 9.13% finally. The inhibition of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) by NH2OH dosing alone was reversible because the nitrate build-up occurred again from 106.9 to 287.6 mgN L−1 within just 11 days after NH2OH dosing was stopped. The evolution of the anammox bacteria, ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and NOB from quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays verified the changes of the nitrogen removal performance of the CPNA process and proved that this in-situ restoration strategy could successfully solve the problem of nitrate build-up in the CPNA process.",

Directed evolution was utilized in this paper to improve the activity of phytase from B. subtilis 168 in neutral and acidic environments. After two rounds of evolution, a number of positive mutants were picked out from the mutant library.

Here we report, for the first time, two effective methods for the immobilization of unspecific peroxygenase (UPO; EC 1.11.2.1). This biocatalyst type comprises heavily glycosylated heme-thiolate proteins that catalyze various biotechnologically relevant oxyfunctionalizations. Both the encapsulation in cryogel and the retention of the enzyme in hollow fiber modules were found to be efficient methods for their immobilization. After encapsulation, the enzyme still exhibited 60% of its initial activity. Interestingly, we did not find differences in the kinetic parameters of free and immobilized UPOs. In long-term experiments, the conversion of the pharmaceutical diclofenac with immobilized UPOs in different reactor types yielded between 62 mg and 154 mg of the major human drug metabolite 4′-hydroxydiclofenac. The maximal total turnover number was about 60-fold higher compared to the free enzyme. A test over 5 months showed that storage of encapsulated UPOs in non-polar solvents (e.g., cyclohexane) helps to preserve the enzyme stability and increases their relative activity (by about ∼150%, in the case of diclofenac hydroxylation). In addition to the hydrophilic substrate diclofenac, encapsulated UPOs also oxidized the hydrophobic model compound cyclohexane.",

The results were investigated visually and also by UV–vis spectroscopic measurements. This method detected up to 1.09 pg μL−1 of unamplified Brucella genomic DNA. Since Brucella is a facultative intracellular bacteria, clinical samples were amplified by PCR, and colorimetric detections were performed.

The optimum PCL concentration in CA/PCL/corn-cobs bead was 12%, which provided enzymes secreted by the G.lucidum mycelia with a good storage stability and a similar activity to the immobilized laccase. Scanning Electron Microscope and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method were applied to characterize the bead. CA/PCL/corn-cobs ensured the highest ANT removal efficiency regardless of different pH values and temperatures. The ANT removal from soil followed third-order reaction model. Removal of ANT reached 96.2% ± 2.0% from soil after 20 days of incubation at pH 5.0 and 45 °C, which is attributed to the fast secretion of enzymes stimulated by lignocellulosic substances of the corn-cobs, the protection of enzymes by matrix capsules, and the strong adsorption of ANT on the relatively hydrophobic surface of bead. The efficient ANT removal was also observed in aged soil samples simulated by addition of soil organic matter.",

However this approach has drawbacks, including high cost and the incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. As a result, there has been renewed interest in the use of bacteriophages (phages) to control S. aureus. However, aggregation facilitates this bacterium’s persistence in the host, and the ability to aggregate has been increasingly recognized as an important Staphylococcus virulence factor. This study revealed that polyclonal bovine IgG enhanced aggregation of S. aureus (SA003), isolated from raw-milk samples from cows with mastitis. IgG-dependent aggregation delayed lysis of SA003 by the specific bacteriophage (ΦSA012), originally isolated from sewage influent. Addition of IgG also lowered the phage–host adsorption rate constant (ka). The ka value of the IgG-containing condition was approximately 1/8 of that of the IgG-free condition. In addition to the decrease of ka value, increase of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ΦSA012 toward SA003 was observed. Fluorescence microscopical and confocal laser microscopical observations revealed that phages were mainly localized on the surfaces of cell aggregates. IgG-dependent S. aureus aggregation in crude milk is a problem that must be solved before phage therapy can be successfully used to treat bovine mastitis caused by this bacterium.",

The parameters considered included cultivation method, substrate particle size and pretreatment, agitation speed, and pH. For both shake flask and stirred tank bioreactor (STB), a new sequential cultivation method employing steam explosion pretreated sugarcane bagasse significantly improved enzyme production, compared to conventional submerged fermentation. Larger substrate particle size provided a better support for fungal growth in shake flasks, while smaller particles resulted in greater homogeneity in stirred tank bioreactors.

This strain was selected for its high degumming ability and low cellulose damage. In the degumming process, the gum in ramie bast fibers induced the strain to secrete high activities of pectinase and xylanase, both of which were proven to be essential for degumming.

This is more efficient than other reported microbial degumming methods that do not use microorganisms directly.

The regression coefficient demonstrated that the removal of hemicellulose resulted in higher lignin content, which might affect the biomass properties in terms of water absorption and enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis evaluated by dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method. For a higher throughput system, aqueous sample analysis was performed using an immersion probe equipped with an InGaAs detector, which generated an acceptable calibration model having RMSEP of 4.25% and Rp2 of 0.94. These results show the great potential of NIR spectroscopy for achieving fast, accurate, and nondestructive analysis, and its highly adaptability for maintaining an ethanol bioconversion system.TGS, triglycine sulfate",

     "abstract": "Batch cultivation of Catharanthus roseus hairy roots was attempted in a statistically optimized nutrient medium. This resulted in a biomass growth of 5.12 ± 0.46 g/l and ajmalicine content of 24.9 ± 1.2 mg/l on day 30 beyond which the product concentration declined. Using the observed batch kinetics data a mathematical model was developed which could describe the experimental observations to the extent of 99% accuracy as demonstrated by the statistical validity test. The model was thereafter extrapolated to fed-batch cultivation to identify suitable nutrient feeding strategies (by off-line simulations) for the overproduction of ajmalicine. Eventually the experimental implementation of three such feeding strategies and comparison with the model predictions further reinforced the efficacy of the mathematical model under dynamic fed batch conditions. A 60% increase in ajmalicine overall productivity and a 2.5 fold increase in volumetric yield was obtained by the “increasing feed rate strategy” as opposed to batch cultivation. To further improve the alkaloid accumulation a combination of statistically optimized mixture of elicitor(s) (jasmonic acid, methyl jasmonate and KCl) was added after the termination of model based increasing fed batch cultivation which resulted in a significantly high ajmalicine concentration of 123.2 ± 8.63 mg/l (a 4 fold increase compared to batch). This is the first report of such a strategy for overproduction of ajmalicine in rather complex hairy root cultivation.",

Dimethyl formamide (DMF)/H2O (9:1) was used as a new suspending media. Electrochemical activity of the electrode toward the oxidation of glucose was studied using differential pulse voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A synergistic effect was substantiated between the MWCNTs and nano-CuO for glucose electroxidation. The effects of nanocomposite layer thickness and MWCNTs/CuO mass ratio on the sensor performance were investigated and optimized. The detection limit, and linear range of the sensor were identified as 0.07 (±0.03) μmol L−1 (S/N = 3) and 0.5–2000.0 μmol L−1, respectively, under applied oxidation potential of 0.35 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The sensor exhibited excellent sensitivity of 3968.42 (±0.84) μA L mmol−1 cm−2 to glucose, being higher than those of the previously reported similar sensors. The determination of glucose (5.0 μmol L−1, n = 5) with the sensor resulted in RSD% of 3.4. Furthermore, the reproducibility of the sensor was equal to 5.7%. The developed sensor was compared with other enzyme-less glucose sensors and its superiority over them was demonstrated reasonably. The optimized sensor was applied to glucose determination in blood samples. The efficiency of the sensor for glucose determination was comparable with that of a commercial enzymatic sensor.",

Significant inhibitory effects were observed when OMWAcid concentration was 75 and 100%. Thereafter, experiments with laboratory prepared solutions, simulating the OMWAcid, allowed to demonstrate that polyphenols significantly contributed to the observed inhibition.

     "abstract": "Oleaginous microorganisms like microalgae have emerged as a promising alternative feedstock in the production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) since they can accumulate high levels of lipids without competing with food production and having oil productivity values higher than oilseed crops. The lipids of Nannochloropsisgaditana microalga were extracted with methanol and analysed to determine its chemical composition. Since typical homogenous catalysis requires additional purification units and extracted oil presented many free fatty acids (FFAs) (∼22 wt%), FAMEs were synthesized using solid acid catalysts like ion-exchange resins (Amberlite-15, CT-275, CT-269), KSF clay and silica–alumina. Despite their high surface area, the lower acidity of silica–alumina led to a FAME yield lower than the ones obtained using KSF clay and ion-exchange resins. The good results obtained with these catalysts discard diffusion limitations when resins or KSF clay are used as catalysts. FAME synthesis through an indirect method with a previous lipid extraction was compared with the direct reaction of dry microalga biomass. Better results (FAME yields above 90 mol%) were obtained in the two-step method using ion-exchange resins. However, these catalysts lost their activity, so they were regenerated by washing with methanol and HCl.",

The interaction of Hg2+ and Cu2+ at various concentration combinations showed that the binary interaction of 10−8 mol/L Cu2+ and 10−6 mol/L Hg2+ (Binary union S) buffer was of synergistic nature, while 10−4 mol/L Cu2+ and 10−4 mol/L Hg2+ (Binary union I) buffer was of competitive inhibition. The conformational changes in papain structure due to the interaction of binary metal ions were studied by ATR-FTIR, UV–vis and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopies, also the changes of papain catalytic behavior were studied through kinetic analysis. Decreasing of α-helix content with increasing in intermolecular β-sheet aggregates content in Binary union I buffer resulted in an inactivation of papain activity by 57.2% and lower affinity for casein. On the contrary, papain activity increased with α-helix content increasing and intermolecular β-sheet aggregates content decreasing in Binary union S buffer. The competitive interaction between Cu2+ and Hg2+ on papain activity was found at higher concentrations (≥10−4 mol/L), and the inhibition of the binary metal ions on papain was of a noncompetitive type.",

While there has been extensive work on low-strength and low solids effluent, there has been limited application in high-solids, high fats systems such as slaughterhouse wastewater, which are a key application. A 200 L AnMBR pilot plant operated at 2 Australian cattle slaughterhouses consistently removed over 95% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from the wastewater. Virtually all degradable COD was converted to biogas, 78–90% of nitrogen and 74% of phosphorus in the wastewater were released to the treated permeate as ammonia and phosphate, respectively; which would enable subsequent nutrient capture.

Immobilized A. oryzae, constructed to overexpress phospholipase A1 (PLA1) and cultivated in the presence of reticulated polyurethane foams, attained the extracellular PLA1 activities of 51.2–62.0 U/ml after 96–120 h, higher than those of suspension cells (36.9–53.5 U/ml). Moreover, the extracellular PLA1 activity of the immobilized cells at 0.5% polypeptone concentration was 34.8 U/ml, which is more than one-half of the maximum activity attained using 2% polypeptone concentration. Further investigations suggested the contribution of high growth rates of immobilized cells toward the enhanced PLA1 production. The macroscopic morphology, which affects the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the interior of cell pellets, is likely the reason for the high growth rates. This is based on the findings that, at 0.5% polypeptone concentration, the suspension cells formed mycelial clumps growing to a diameter of 10 mm, whereas the immobilized cells maintained a dense film with a thickness of 0.4 mm at the surface of the reticulated matrix. Together with the potential utility of repeated-batch cultivation, immobilized cell culture can be a powerful tool for targeted control of fungal morphology in bioprocesses using A. oryzae.",

A comparative study using three different techniques was undertaken to study mixing performances in the system. Firstly, mixing time (tm) was estimated in the reactor using both experimental methods, including instrumental method and image analysis, and CFD. As hydrodynamics is not occurring in the fully-turbulent regime, turbulent numerical simulations using the SST transitional and the standard k-ϵ turbulence models were conducted and compared to laminar approach. Results showed good agreement between the two experimental methods and no significant differences were observed between the simulation methods. Moreover, according to results, a minimum agitation rate of 350 rpm seemed to be appropriated to obtain a quick homogenization in the system. Finally, the second part of the study seemed to indicate that probes had no significant impact in the studied reactor.",

In order to simplify this traditional process, we developed an one-pot bi-enzyme catalyzed procedure by coupling immobilized cephalosporin C acylase (CPCA) with immobilized cephalosporin C deacetylase (CAH), which contained two parallel cascade reactions: firstly, hydrolysis of CPC to 7-ACA by CPCA, then deacetylation of 7-ACA to D-7-ACA by CAH (route 1); or firstly, hydrolysis of CPC to deacetyl-CPC (D-CPC) by CAH, then de-α-aminoadipoylation of D-CPC to D-7-ACA by CPCA (route 2). A D-7-ACA yield of 78.39% was achieved in 30 min in a single reactor under the optimized enzyme amount. The specific productivity of D-7-ACA reached 10.85 g g−1 h−1 L−1, which increased approximately 4-fold compared to that obtained from the two-pot enzymatic process. The half-time of immobilized CPCA was approximately 18 h while immobilized CAH was approximately 534 h under the operational conditions. These results demonstrated the industrial feasibility of this one-pot process and its clear advantages towards the traditional three-enzyme three-pot process.",

Some important process parameters were optimized by OFAT methodology. Along with this, the effect of metal ions and mediators on the process of decolorization was also evaluated. The maximum decolorization (96.34%) of 7.5 mg/L dye was achieved at 42 U/mL of enzyme dose, 0.25 mM of H2O2 and 0.5 mM of p-coumaric acid. The pH, temperature and time for maximum decolorization were recorded to be 4.5, 45 °C, and 5 min, respectively. The presence of metal ions did not exert any drastic influence on the process of decolorization, ensuring it suitable for industrial applications. The optimization and interactive effect of pH, enzyme dose, and dye concentration for maximum decolorization was also investigated by RSM through central composite design matrix. UPLC/MS analyses were performed to identify the degradation products. As a result a mechanistic pathway for degradation of basic violet 3 was proposed. It was also found that degraded products of basic violet 3 showed less phytotoxicity than the dye itself, using Zea mays as test organism.",

Several strong inducible and constitutive promoters have been identified in P. pastoris which make the host ideal in r-protein expressions. The constitutive promoter of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, PGAP, is promising as its use offers the advantage of associating product quantity to growth which can be optimized by a well-designed feeding strategy so long as the product itself is not toxic to the host. In this article, carbon source metabolism and the central carbon pathways of P. pastoris are reviewed. After comparing PGAP with the available promoters of P. pastoris, the bioreactor operation parameters and bioreactor operation strategies are analyzed for r-protein production under PGAP by focusing on response of the cells, final product concentration, yield, and productivity. The overview of the subject reveals the requirement for in-depth information on the overall regulation of P. pastoris metabolism that can enable fine-tuning bioreactor operation parameters in relation with the physiology of the microorganism in order to develop new strategies for the enhanced r-protein production.",

Culture conditions of ITHRCs were optimized by Box–Behnken design, and six main AK constituents were qualitatively and quantitatively determined by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). Under the culture temperature (24.7 °C), inoculum size (0.75%), sucrose concentration (3.14%) and initial pH (5.8), ITHRCs (23 day-old) in MS/2 medium gave the maximum biomass dry weight (DW) of 12.85 g/L and the optimal total AK content of 521.77 μg/g DW. Results showed that the proposed ITHRCs system possessed higher ability of AK production as compared to that of 2 year-old field-grown roots (464.69 μg/g DW).

Neither increasing their amount nor supplementing with glucose increased the FA-Glu titer, suggesting the presence of an inhibitor in these feedstocks. By using a mixture of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, over 65% of SBH solids were converted to soluble carbohydrates. FA-Glu titers obtained from SBH hydrolysates containing residual hull solids were still low; however, with the removal of the solids, cell growth improved and FA-Glu yield was 60% higher than with glucose.

The permeabilized cells were evaluated for the enantioselective hydrolysis of mandelonitrile, which showed an initial reaction rate of about 2-fold that of the cells without permeabilization. The permeabilization process did not impair the stability of the cells and after simple immobilization by glutaraldehyde cross-linking, the immobilized permeabilized cells were successfully recycled for 15 runs without significant activity loss, suggesting the potential application of the immobilized permeabilized cells for the production of (R)-(−)-mandelic acid.

Ore samples were prepared representatively as grab samples of a larger heap. Particle size distributions and agglomerate masses of the prepared ore samples were shown to be similar within acceptable variance and provided comparable surface areas for microbial colonisation and chemical reaction. The microbial abundance within the whole ore system was determined from effluent sampling for the planktonic population and the systematic and sequential sacrifice of identically operated mini-column reactors to determine the change in the ore-associated microbial population with time. Microbial colonisation and growth rate kinetics were determined from analysis of these populations. The growth curves obtained for the bulk flowing solution and ore-associated populations at the base case operating conditions were reproducible, within a 95% confidence interval.",

However, MV has also been shown to have detrimental effects including inhibition of cell growth. Unfortunately, studies have shown little information regarding the MV redox state. A thermodynamic model is presented and validated in order to predict the most likely redox state of MV depending on the redox potential, pH, and degree of MV dimerization. Model results showed that there are narrow potential ranges in which MV can change from one redox state to another. During fermentation processes in which the potential is in these narrow ranges, slight perturbations in the redox potentials can drastically change the redox state of MV. This may explain the observed variations in the positive and negative effects of MV. Thus, caution should be used when applying MV to any biological system.

However, in the low quality oils, expect triglycerides, other lipids represented by phospholipids also exist.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop an effective method for the conversion of phospholipids-containing oils. In recent years, the employment of free lipase in catalyzing biodiesel from refined oils has received great attentions due to its advantages of lower cost and faster reaction rate. To further promote its application in efficient conversion of phospholipids-containing oils, a synchronous catalysis together with phospholipase and lipase for biodiesel production from phospholipids-containing oils was developed. A high FAME yield of 94.9% can be obtained even with 10% phospholipids contained in the oil feedstock. Further study showed that the biodiesel product could also meet the phosphorus demand of EN14214 standard.

     "abstract": "Glycerol is a co-product of many industrial processes and is generated in large quantities from different origins. In this study, glycerol is used as a cheap carbon source for the production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) with two different collection strains, Cupriavidus necator and Burkholderia sacchari, in order to provide an alternative outlet for glycerol and produce value-added bioproducts. The objective of this work was to study the influence of this carbon source on their growth kinetics, on their polymer production, and on the molecular mass of the produced biopolymer. Therefore, fermentations in bioreactors were carried out with these strains. Different results for both strains were obtained showing, for the first time, a high cell dry mass and growth rate, when glycerol was used together with glucose in the fermentation with C. necator. In the first fermentation with B. sacchari using glycerol as a sole carbon source, the strain properly developed synthesizing PHB. The biopolymers obtained from both fermentations with glycerol showed low molecular masses about 300 kDa with a polydispersity of 4.72 with C. necator, and 200 kDa with polydispersity of 2.50 with B. sacchari.",

This improvement in ɛ-PL production and cell mass production can be related to 0.5% n-dodecane that could maintain dissolved oxygen concentration >32% saturation throughout the course of the ɛ-PL production phase. The transcription level of key genes and enzyme activities were analyzed. Results showed that the metabolic pathway responsible for ɛ-PL synthesis was strengthened when n-dodecane was added. The change in intracellular nucleotide levels was also investigated. Higher ATP level and a lower NADH/NAD+ ratio were obtained with 0.5% n-dodecane in broth, thereby providing more energy for ɛ-PL synthesis. These results indicated that ɛ-PL synthesis was strengthened from carbon metabolism and energy metabolism with 0.5% n-dodecane in broth.",

The smallest size was obtained when the pH was 4, but the polydispersity index (PDI) was the highest; the opposite behavior was observed at pH 5.5. CHI/TPP nanoparticles were also studied in terms of physico-chemical stability in two extreme situations: increasing the pH of the CHI/TPP nanoparticles to 7 and adding nanoparticles to PBS buffer (pH 7.4). In both cases, the buffer conditions modulated the nanoparticle properties and time was also an important parameter. Plasmid pVAX1Luc was used for incorporation into CHI/TPP nanoparticles (CHI:TPP 5.8:1 m/m) at 10 and 20% DNA/CHI w/w.

The present study shows that the evolutionary polynomial regression methodology (EPR) is able to predict the performances of an attached granular biomass system so that it is possible to make the necessary operating changes in advance, avoiding deterioration in the quality of the effluent discharged. The present paper shows the results of EPR application to gross parameters of a granular attached biomass reactor. For each parameter, a model capable of predicting the effluent value was assessed, based on the knowledge of the influent characteristics. Coefficients of determination values (CoD) obtained during the models validation phase, can be said to be more than satisfactory, varying between 84.2% and 94.6%. Moreover, the applied tests showed typical behaviours commonly found when observed and predicted values are quite similar. This paper reports the first application attempt for modelling this kind of emerging treatment system and gross parameters.",

Applying a voltage of 0.5 V in R1 enhanced the NB reduction, AN production, and COD removal comparing to the reference reactors. Raising voltage from 0.5 to 1.2 V improved the conversion of NB to AN. The assistance of MEC intensified Fe2+ leaching and accelerated the process of sludge granulation. As compared with abiotic electrode, the cathode of R1 presented higher value of NB reduction rate constant (k). Real-time PCR and cloning sequencing analysis showed that the abundances of bacteria and methanogens were significantly higher than that of reference reactor, in which some species capable of reducing NB were dominant in R1.",

Although mono-digestion of lignocellulosic biomasses are often performed with very long solid retention times (SRT), the present study demonstrated an efficient process operating with a 30-day SRT and an organic loading rate of 4 g VS/L d.

The RNM and RSN processes showed superior process stability evidenced by minimal volatile fatty acid accumulation (˂0.5 g/L). As compared to the RNM process, RSN demonstrated the best performance.

Under oxygen-limited conditions with a 30 mmol L−1 h−1 of oxygen uptake rate, an optimum methanol dosage level of 10 gL−1 was established by comparing antibody titers under different methanol dosages during protein production. Real-time on-line NIR monitoring of glycerol concentration, methanol concentration, and relative cell density provided valuable data for process characterization and optimization. Real-time profiles of glycerol concentration and relative cell density documented run-to-run consistency during the batch and fed-batch phases by analyses of the glycerol consumption and cell growth kinetics. The volumetric methanol consumption rate was characterized for the induction process following the end of the glycerol fed-batch phase. Under oxygen-limited conditions, the volumetric methanol consumption rate increased over a 60-h period and this increase was independent of the methanol concentration over a range of 2.5–30 gL−1 when the oxygen utilization rate was maintained at 30 mmol L−1 h−1.

Purification yields obtained are still lower than those found for other chromatographic membrane adsorbers, consistent with the promotion of unspecific interactions hindering pDNA purification.

     "abstract": "The recombinant laccase rLAC-EN3-1 was purified from Pichia pastoris in which the laccase gene lac-En3-1 from Ganoderma sp.En3 was successfully expressed. The properties of the purified rLAC-EN3-1 were studied. rLAC-EN3-1 showed strong stability under the alkaline conditions. rLAC-EN3-1 also exhibited strong resistance to some enzyme inhibitors such as SDS and EDTA. The effect of various metal ions on the laccase activity of rLAC-EN3-1 was investigated. rLAC-EN3-1 could tolerate very high concentrations of CuSO4, MnSO4 and MgSO4 (100 mM). The effect of different organic solvents on the activity and stability of rLAC-EN3-1 was also determined. rLAC-EN3-1 had a very strong ability to tolerate some organic solvents widely used in the industry such as glycerin, ethylene glycol, butanediol. The results of decolorization test indicated that rLAC-EN3-1 had a strong capacity for decolorizing malachite green with the coexistence of high concentrations of different metal ions and organic solvents. Organic solvents tested in this study had little impact on the decolorization capability of rLAC-EN3-1. In addition, decolorized dye showed much lower toxicity to Pleurotus ostreatus than the original dye. Above advantages of rLAC-EN3-1 suggested that this laccase had a great potential and promising application value in the field of environmental biotechnology.",

     "abstract": "Lipase from Candida rugosa was immobilized by adsorption onto laboratory prepared supports, silica SBA-15 and zirconia. The adsorption process was studied as a function of pH in terms of percent of adsorbed lipase, enzyme activity and zeta potential of support and enzyme. Several analytical approaches such as laser Doppler electrophoresis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed that the lipase was successfully immobilized onto both supports. The ζ-potential data suggest that the adsorption efficiency does not depends on the sign but on the magnitude of the surface charge of adsorption partners, and therefore underline the importance of their dispersion stability. Adsorption to material surface altered enzyme characteristics. vmax for the lipase immobilized onto silica and zirconia were 4.8-fold and 3.6-fold lower than that of the free lipase, respectively. The Km showed no alteration of enzyme-substrate affinity on zirconia support, whereas the enzyme immobilized on silica had 3.6 times lower affinity. Thermostability at 60 °C of the lipase was improved 12-fold on zirconia and 4-fold on silica. Finally, in examining reusability, the immobilized lipase retained more than 90% of initial activity after eight reuses on both supports.",

     "publication date": "01-2015",
     "abstract": "The production of recombinant proteins in Lactococcus lactis is often limited by several process and biological constraints. Recombinant gene expression in the P170 system of L. lactis is triggered at a pH below 6.5 by lactic acid accumulation. This work has used static flask, batch bioreactor and chemostat studies to independently investigate various factors affecting production of recombinant streptokinase. These factors are induction strength, complex-nutrient supplementation, specific growth rate and the cellular response to acid-stress termed as acid tolerance response (ATR). In the P170 system, induction strength is mainly a function of lactate concentration. Recombinant protein production is enhanced by increasing induction strength and complex-nutrient supplementation. However, acid-induced cellular stress-response has a deleterious effect on recombinant protein productivity. It is seen that suppression of ATR has the most predominant effect on enhancing recombinant protein productivity. The insights obtained from batch studies were used to investigate fed-batch processes, both during complete development of ATR and during suppression of ATR. During complete ATR-development, a 25-fold enhancement of volumetric productivity was achieved in fed-batch culture, due to a synergistic combination of increased glucose-feed rates and addition of complex-nutrients to the feed. A combination of these factors and ATR-suppression gave rise to nearly 60-fold increase in volumetric productivity in fed-batch culture over batch processes.",

     "abstract": "Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV), a non-enveloped virus, is widely used in gene therapy clinical trials because it does not cause human disease, transduces both dividing and non-dividing cells, and mediates stable transgene expression for years in post-mitotic tissue. Extension of clinical use of rAAV is, however, considerably hampered by difficulties involved in large-scale production of the virus particles. For several serotypes of rAAV these difficulties often arise from the fact that assembled virus particles mainly stay inside of packaging cells, inevitably requiring lysis of cells to harvest virus particles and consequentially complicating downstream purification processes. Here, we show that introduction of foreign viral envelope protein genes, encoding for either VSVG or rabiesG, into packaging cells can remarkably enhance cellular secretion of rAAV2, the AAV serotype most often used in clinical applications. In the presence of the foreign genes, up to 49% of transducing rAAV2 particles were secreted. However, such great enhancement was not observed for rAAV3. Our experimental tests with exosome inhibitors indicated that VSVG-mediated cellular secretion of rAAV2, unlike rabiesG-mediated one, heavily relies upon cellular pathways involving exosomes. Ultimately, an improved understanding of rAAV secretion mechanisms may simplify the production and purification processes for large-scale batches of the virus.",

It was observed that lower F/M and longer SRT resulted in sludges which captured carbon mainly through carbon storage. Surface sorption, however, was the dominant mechanism for sludges grown under the higher DO condition. Generally, biosorption was optimal at pH 7. Sorption kinetic studies revealed that sludge cultivated under the low F/M ratio of 0.15 (Sludge S1) showed the best overall biosorption performance. Determination of calorific value revealed that Sludge S1 was able to capture energy as much as 0.9 kJ/g SS within 15 min contact time. About 66.3% of the overall biosorption capacity was attributed to carbon storage. Sludge S1 was able to accumulate organic substrate and stored this as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). Culture-independent microbial community analysis through DGGE revealed the presence of strains capable of PHA-accumulation, e.g. Rhodobacter sp., and Thauera sp. While different dominating mechanisms resulted from different cultivation conditions, the best biosorption performance was significantly contributed by carbon storage activity.",

Results in pH-controlled stirred tank reactors showed that addition of F. thermophilum into the defined microbial consortium (Acidithiobacillus caldus and Leptospirillum ferriphilum) improved the dissolution and conversion of iron and meanwhile caused significant difference in the planktonic and attached population dynamics. Thereby, copper extraction was accelerated and increased by 22.7% after 24 days in comparison to the control without F. thermophilum. The intensive study of relationships between the modified bioleaching performance and augmentation of F. thermophilum conducted in shake flasks indicated that (1) F. thermophilum was capable of bio-catalytically regenerating the sulfide-attacking agent—ferric iron in bioleaching; (2) more importantly, mixed cultures involving F. thermophilum collaboratively resisted the inhibitory effects of environmental stress conditions on cells, such as 0.04% yeast extract, 5 g L−1 Cu2+ and low initial pH 1.2 demonstrated in the simple growth medium, and furthermore increased the total cell numbers and accelerated the iron or sulfur oxidation compared to pure cultures.

The two-dimensional model domain represents the surface of one half of a disc. The disc is considered to be covered with two layers (biofilm, liquid film) and is partially immersed in bulk liquid. The biofilm is assumed to maintain a constant thickness in time over the entire domain. The enzyme laccase is presumed to play the main role in the decolourization. The regular disc rotation is described using the radial coordinate with the immersion process simulated by a step-like function of the angular coordinate.Using experimental data, we identified values of principal model parameters. Considering the Michaelis–Menten constant value of 0.005 kg m−3, we found suboptimal values of the reaction rate constant (0.003 mol m−3 s−1), proportionality constant influencing the thickness of the liquid film in the submerged phase (7 × 10−6 m rad0.5 s−0.5) and dye diffusion coefficient in the liquid phase (8 × 10−10 m2 s−1). Subsequent parametric studies suggested that the model was able to predict both qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the experimental rotating disc bioreactor on various time scales.",

     "abstract": "Stainless steel bioreactors increasingly fall behind to their disposable counterparts in pharma research as they do not require cleaning or sterilization. This led company ATMI LifeSciences to develop the “Nucleo™”. Original in design, this disposable bioreactor comprises a rectangular parallelepiped plastic bag stirred by a paddle revolving in elliptic pendulum motion. Studies covering this bioreactor showed good homogeneity of culture medium as well as good productivity for animal cell cultures. To further explain these good performances, the flow inside the “Nucleo™” had to be resolved. This paper focuses on the mean flow description, computed from stereo-PIV measurements performed in 20 verticals covering the whole volume of a 50 dm3 Nucleo™ bioreactor. As the flow is already turbulent in the chosen agitation conditions, its dimensionless mean velocity field does not vary with the paddle rotational speed. Mean flow pattern exhibits an axial symmetry – same flow is observed in opposite quarters of the tank – and can be described as a three-dimensional helix coiled on itself to form a distorted horizontal torus which covers the whole tank volume. Mean velocity value is on average doubled in the cone swept by the paddle, and its two horizontal components are twice higher than its vertical ones. However, mean velocity remains significant everywhere and, in particular, no stagnant area is observed in tank corners. Our results thus confirm previous studies observations.",

In this study, one acid treatment (sulphuric acid combined with a subsequent bleaching step) and three alkaline treatments (sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide and a combination of the latter with an halogenated solvent) were evaluated for recovering poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), a type of PHA, from Cupriavidus necator H16 cells with high biopolymer content (65%). Purity, percent of recovery and the properties of the PHB obtained after each treatment, together with the costs and environmental impacts associated with each treatment, were determined and compared. The lowest recovery costs were obtained with the sodium hydroxide and sulphuric acid treatments (1.02 and 1.11 € kg−1, respectively). Estimated CO2 emissions of these two treatments were 18% of those based on the use of sodium hypochlorite. However, the highest purity (98%) and lowest polymer degradation were achieved with the acid treatment. Consequently, the acid treatment was selected as the most effective choice for PHA recovery.",

     "abstract": "Cell productivity in fed-batch processes can be increased by cell cycle arrest through mild hypothermia. However, hypothermia can simultaneously reduce cell growth, which is regulated by the cell cycle. Consequently, the time point for the temperature shift is important and requires optimization while considering the cell cycle. An unstructured cell cycle model which includes the distribution of proliferating (G1, S, G2/M) and arrested cells (G0) has been proposed in order to predict the time point of temperature shift in fed-batch cultures. A model development and analysis framework that enables the evaluation of the required model parameters is described. The parameters are estimated from (fed)-batch cultivations, carried out at 37 °C and at 33 °C in order to characterize temperature dependency. The batch cultures are also used to evaluate substrate depletion and fed-batch cultures are used to study the impact of metabolite accumulation on the cell cycle. The reliability of the proposed framework for parameter estimation is validated using a mAb-producing hybridoma cell culture and the model predicts hypothermic transitions within the cell population at different shift time points. In conclusion, this framework can be used to optimize the time point of the temperature shift, which is commonly adjusted in industrial fed-batch processes in order to obtain a good balance between temperature induced growth limitation and cell cycle specific enhanced productivity.",

     "abstract": "Most of lipases are in equilibrium between a majority inactive closed form and a minority active open form in aqueous media. Perhaps, a certain stabilization of these open forms of lipases could be achieved in the presence of cosolvents or surfactants in the reaction medium. Three commercial lipases were studied (from Thermomyces lanuginosa (TLL), Candida Antarctica fraction B (CALB) and Lecitase (LEC)). Different derivatives were tested: TLL and LEC were adsorbed on an anionic exchanger and their activity strongly depends on the equilibrium between their open and closed form and CALB was adsorbed on a hydrophobic support when the open form was already stabilized by the support. Derivatives ionically adsorbed were hyperactivated by surfactans as well as by cosolvents: the activity of LEC increased 12 times in the presence of 15–20% of ethanol. CALB adsorbed on hydrophobic supports was hardly hyperactivated and even it was inhibited. The modification of the rate of covalent modification of the catalytic Ser seems to confirm that the observed hyperactivations were due to a stabilization of the open form of the adsorbed lipases (TLL and LEC). The hydrolysis of sardine oil was also studied in the presence or absence of surfactants and cosolvents. An interesting improvement in the ability of derivatives to discriminate the release of eicosipentaenic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenicacid (DHA) was found.",

     "abstract": "Herein, a novel enzyme bioreactor based upon polymer–inorganic hybrid microcapsules was prepared through combining biomimetic adhesion and bioinspired mineralization. Briefly, polydopamine (PDA) as the adhesive layer was formed on the surface of CaCO3 particles through self-polymerization of dopamine. Then, polyethyleneimine (PEI) was anchored on the adhesive layer through Michael addition reaction or Schiff base reaction. Subsequently, titania (Ti) as the mineral layer was generated and deposited on the surface of PDA/PEI-coated particles through the bioinspired mineralization process induced by the free amine groups of PEI. Finally, PDA/PEI/Ti hybrid microcapsules were obtained after removing the CaCO3 templates via EDTA treatment. Notably, during the preparation process, PEI could be considered as a “bridge” molecule to connect the adhesive layer and the mineral layer. The chemical/topological structure of the hybrid microcapsules could be facilely tuned by manipulating the molecular weight of PEI. Once utilized for constructing an enzyme bioreactor, the structural evolution of the hybrid microcapsules caused a varied enzyme catalytic activity (42–73 U mg−1). This structure–performance relationship might be due to the alterable diffusion resistance resulting from the mineral layer. Besides, the enzymes encapsulated in PDA/PEI/Ti hybrid microcapsules also exhibited desirable thermal, pH, storage and recycling stabilities.",

There was long-term effect of cultivating voltage on performance of BERs even if the electrical power was shut off. As the dye concentration was higher than 100 mg L−1, the decolorization efficiency and COD removal in the BER were significantly higher than the sum of the same values in a single biological reactor and a single electrochemical reactor, which indicated that there was a synergistic effect between the electrode reaction and biodegradation. Kinetic analysis of color removal of RBR X-3B indicated that the rapid adsorption by microorganisms was weak and the decolorization process with time followed first-order kinetics. GC–MS analysis of the degradation products suggested that the main reaction mechanism of RBR X-3B degradation was the reduction of N=N bonds on the biofilm cathode.",

Significant internal radial and axial temperature gradients were observed (up to 2.4 °C cm−1), but despite of this, good titers of the production of the six enzyme groups evaluated was observed in all three bed layers sampled.

In this design we maintained gas outlets closed, which eliminated all bubbling and media foaming, and added a compressed pure oxygen inlet, which increased oxygen tension.

Although microalgae species capable of biohydrogen production do exist, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is considered to be one of the most promising eukaryotic H2 producers, and can serve as a model organism for such studies. Unfortunately, even if the metabolic basis and environmental conditions for this process are well defined, the sustainability of biohydrogen production is not straightforward. At this point, genetic engineering tools must be efficacious in order to enable mutant strains to reach desired amounts of biohydrogen.

The results showed that an increase in the light intensity shortened the lag phase of hydrogen production.

     "abstract": "Enzymatic reactions with supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) have received increased attention during the last decade. The objective of this study was to alter the activity and stability of Bacillus sp. protease under SC-CO2 conditions. The activity and stability of protease were evaluated according to the effects of operational variables, temperature (28–80 °C), pressure (60–300 bar), CO2 flow (2–10 g/min) and process duration (60–180 min). Best conditions were identified as 300 bar, 54 °C, 6 g/min CO2 flow and 120 min of process time efficient 54.4% (417.50 μmol/ml/min) as against to the untreated enzyme. Activity enhancement was observed with the raise of pressure while low flow rates decreased the activity by 5.1% with a flow rate of 2 g/min under supercritical conditions. Potential mechanisms for pressure stimulated activation and stabilization were investigated by NMR, SEM, FTIR, SDS-PAGE and XPS analyses. As a result, applications of SC-CO2 medium for enzymatic processes are expected to become sustainable and important with economical synthetic and environmentally friendly protocols.",

In the cofermentation broth eight organic acids with a total amount of 16 g/l were found. Major acids were lactic, formic and acetic acid, followed by gluconic, succinic, pyroglutaminc and propionic acid. In the cofermenation, three times more organic acids were released than in the monofermentation of G. 2003. The fermentation time of 96 h was almost half of the cultivated cycle reported.",

     "abstract": "The capsular polysaccharide (PS) is the most important pneumococcal virulence factor and is currently used as antigen in all pneumococcal vaccines. Despite its physiological and epidemiological importance, meager studies have been devoted to improve PS production and understand its relationship with pneumococcal central metabolism. In this study, kinetics of growth and production of PS by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 14 (PS14) in batch and continuous cultivation were investigated. Strong cell lysis was observed in batch cultivation, while accumulation of organic acids and autolysis was avoided in continuous cultivation. In the continuous cultivation was possible to achieve higher concentration of biomass and PS14. Calculation of kinetic parameters demonstrated that PS14 is a cell-associated product. The coefficients for growth-associated stoichiometric true yield and maintenance were determined as 0.25 gglucose gbiomass−1 and 1.24 gglucose (gbiomass h)−1, respectively. The maximum productivity of PS14 released in the supernatant (PS14R) and cell-bound PS14 (PS14C) were obtained at a dilution rate of 0.8 h−1, respectively, 85 and 122 mg  (gbiomass h)−1. Compared to batch fermentation, both PS14R and PS14C productivities were increased by about 300% in the continuous process. These findings demonstrate that continuous cultivation is a promising strategy for PS production to be used in pneumococcal vaccines.",

This work approaches nonlinear estimation strategies for microbial production of enzymes, exemplified by using a process of lipase production from olive oil by Candida rugosa. First, by using a dynamical mathematical model of this process, an asymptotic observer which reconstructs the unavailable state variables is proposed. The design of this kind of observers is based on mass and energy balances without the knowledge of kinetics being necessary; only minimal information concerning the measured concentrations is used. Second, a nonlinear high-gain observer is designed for the estimation of imprecisely known kinetics of the bioprocess. An important advantage of this high-gain estimator is that the tuning is reduced to the calibration of a single parameter. Numerical simulations in various scenarios are provided in order to test the behaviour and performances of the proposed nonlinear estimation strategies.",

A fed-batch protocol using the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyl adenine (3-MA), developed for a tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) expressing DHFR based CHO cell line, was successfully adapted to a monoclonal antibody (MAb) expressing CHOK1-SV based CHO cell line. By optimizing the timing and dose of 3-MA treatment, the cell-specific productivity was increased 4-fold, resulting in 2-fold increased total MAb production. The positive effect of the 3-MA treatment appeared to be reduced when the amino acid feed concentration was increased 5-fold. Further investigation revealed that by slowly increasing osmolality up to ∼450 mOsm/kg, both the cell-specific productivity and the total MAb almost doubled. This effect was replicated with a DUXB-based CHO cell line expressing a human–llama chimeric antibody. The positive effect of gradually increasing osmolality was then combined with the positive effects of the 3-MA treatment, however their combined effect were not additive. Thus, either increased osmolality or 3-MA treatment were equally effective in increasing MAb-CHO cell fed-batch production on the cell lines tested. Analysis of protein glycosylation showed that both of these fed-batch modifications did not substantially influence the overall glycan profiles of the MAb product.",

In the present study, an effective biological separation method has been developed to harvest microalgae via immobilization on exogenous fungal mycelium. Fungal mycelium was added into microalgae culture and air mixed for the immobilization. The immobilized microalgae with fungal mycelium were naturally precipitated within 10 min after stopping the mixing. Both marine (e.g. Nannochloropsis sp.) and freshwater (e.g. Chlorella vulguris) microalgae were almost completely (94–97%) precipitated using the mycelium of Aspergillus nomius CCK-PDA 7#6. The precipitated mixed biomass was separated by simple filtration using sieve. A 70% initial nutrients supplement to de-algated culture medium gave high growth yield (0.43 g/l) in subsequent microalgae cultivation. The mycelium can be obtained free or at low-cost as waste from a fungal fermentation process of producing valuable products. The developed method is, therefore, very promising for economical harvesting of microalgae.",

     "abstract": "Tubular structures made of alginate and similar hydrogels have been extensively investigated for drug delivery, tissue engineering and other biomedical applications. Alginate fibers are usually fabricated using complicated techniques such as coaxial flow extrusion or electro-spinning. This paper discusses the fabrication of hollow and solid alginate fibers using a simple membrane based molding technique. A hollow-fiber microfiltration membrane served both as the mold as well as reservoir for the cross-linking agent. The pores of the membrane were first filled with the cross-linker (i.e. calcium chloride) solution, after which the lumen was filled with sodium alginate solution. The calcium ions diffused from the membrane pores into the lumen, cross-linking the alginate in a radially inward direction. Solid alginate fibers were obtained by cross-linking all the alginate within the lumen, while hollow fibers were fabricated by pushing out un-cross-linked alginate from the central core using calcium chloride solution. The alginate fibers fabricated as described above were expelled from the membrane mold using water under pressure. These were then characterized by optical, fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. The most attractive features of this fabrication method are its simplicity and flexibility with regards to alginate concentration. The fibers obtained were straight with excellent definition and uniform thickness, and could be fabricated in a highly reproducible manner. Other complicated solid and hollow 3-dimensional structures suitable for biomedical, and indeed other applications could also potentially be fabricated using similar membrane-based molding techniques.",

The results showed that with the optimal Mg2+ dosage (10 mg/L), biomass production (4125.6 mg/L) was enhanced by 59%. The biomass yield was improved by 43.3%. COD and protein removal increased more than 90%. Hydraulic retention time was decreased by 25%. Moreover, 5–10 mg/L Mg2+ improved R. gelatinosus yield in wastewater to medium levels. Analyses revealed that different Mg2+ concentrations had different mechanisms for impacting biomass production and COD removal. This was because there was an upper limit (15 mg/L) and an optimal value (6 mg/L) of intracellular Mg2+ concentrations for R. gelatinosus. Appropriate Mg2+ concentrations enhanced ATP production, which improved the secretion and activity of protease, indicating that more protein and COD were removed and more biomass accumulated. However, excessive Mg2+ was harmful for biomass accumulation and COD removal because excess Mg2+ decreased ATP production.",

     "abstract": "High activity of glucose oxidase (GOD) enzyme (immobilized in porous silica particles) is desirable for a better glucose biosensor. In this work, effect of pore diameter of two porous hosts on enzyme immobilization, activity and glucose sensing was compared. The hosts were amine functionalized: (i) microporous silica (NH2-MS) and (ii) mesoporous silica (NH2-SBA-15). Based on whether the dimension of GOD is either larger or smaller than the pore diameter, GOD was immobilized on either external or internal surface of NH2-MS and NH2-SBA-15, with loadings of 512.5 and 634 mg/g, respectively. However, GOD in NH2-SBA-15 gave a higher normalized absolute activity (NAA), which led to an amperometric sensor with a larger linear range of 0.4–13.0 mM glucose. In comparison, GOD in NH2-MS had a lower NAA and a smaller linear range of 0.4–3.1 mM. In fact, the present GOD-NH2-SBA-15 electrode based sensor was better than other MS and SBA-15 based electrodes reported in literature. Thus, achieving only a high GOD loading (as in NH2-MS) does not necessarily give a good sensor performance. Instead, a host with a relatively larger pore than enzyme, together with optimized electrode composition ensures the sensor to be functional in both hyper- and hypoglycemic range.",

Rat hepatocytes were cultured on the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes for 14 days in monolayer culture, sandwich culture with Matrigel and 3D culture with microporous expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membranes in the presence and absence of direct oxygenation from the other side of the membranes.

Additionally, the expression levels of various drug-metabolism genes, as examined by PCR arrays, were also closest to those of freshly isolated hepatocytes. As the cellular maintenance has been greatly improved by microporous ePTFE membranes, the hepatocytes in 3D culture performed increased functions that comparable to those in sandwich culture.

Moreover, nano-gold tracing technique was innovatively used to study the adsorption and transmission mechanism of ligninolytic enzymes in the process of SSF. The results showed that the effects of three common mediators on the degradation of lignin were in descending order: veratryl alcohol > ABTS > Mn2+, and the optimum dosages were: Mn2+ (20 μM g−1), ABTS (0.2 μM g−1), veratryl alcohol (4 μM g−1). A significantly high degradation ratio of lignin (31.8%) was achieved at the optimum dosages of ligninolytic enzymes and mediators. In addition, laccase, as a typical ligninolytic enzyme, was selected to conjugate to nano-gold for the study of adsorption and transmission mechanism. An obvious decrease of nano-gold-laccase conjugates was observed after 10 days of enzymatic hydrolysis and there were few laccase residues on the surface of straw fibers after 30 days of enzymatic hydrolysis. The present findings will advance the understanding of mediator-involved enzymatic degradation of lignin, as well as the adsorption and transmission mechanism of ligninolytic enzymes in lignin degradation, which could provide useful references for developing waste biotreatment technology.",

The alcoholysis reactions were catalyzed by lipases Lipozyme® TL IM from Thermomyces lanuginosus and lipase QLG® from Alcaligenes sp., because these lipases have shown selectivity towards DHA and EPA, respectively. Studies were made to determine the influence of reaction time, alcohol/oil molar ratio, lipase amount and temperature. In the optimized conditions for the alcoholysis of tuna and sardine oils catalyzed by Lipozyme TL IM and lipase QLG, respectively, the DHA and EPA contents were trebled (from 22 to 69% for DHA, and from 19 to 61% for EPA). The stability of both lipases was also determined. Although Lipozyme TL IM is much more stable in isobutanol than in ethanol, with the former the conversion attained after four reaction cycles was about 40% of the initial conversion. In similar conditions, the conversion obtained with lipase QLG was about 88% of the initial conversion. In addition, the separation of DHA enriched acylglycerols and isobutyl esters from an alcoholysis reaction was studied by liquid–liquid fractionation using the ethanol–water–hexane biphasic system. The DHA enriched acylglycerols obtained were 97.6% pure (64.4% DHA).",

In particular, protein aggregation within mammalian cells has significant implications in the disease pathology and biologics production; making protein aggregation modulation within mammalian cells a very important engineering topic. Previously, we showed that the semi-rational design approach can be used to reduce the intracellular aggregation of a protein by recovering the conformational stability that was lowered by the mutation. However, this approach has limited utility when no rational design approach to enhance conformational stability is readily available. In order to overcome this limitation, we investigated whether the modification of residues significantly displaced upon the original mutation is an effective way to reduce protein aggregation in mammalian cells. As a model system, human copper, zinc superoxide dismutase mutant containing glycine to alanine mutation at position 93 (SOD1G93A) was used. A panel of mutations was introduced into residues substantially displaced upon the G93A mutation. By using cell-based aggregation assays, we identified several novel variants of SOD1G93A with reduced aggregation propensity within mammalian cells. Our findings successfully demonstrate that the aggregation of a mutant protein can be suppressed by mutating the residues significantly displaced upon the original mutation.",

Thermodynamic parameters were firstly derived based on fluorescence spectroscopic data. Then, kinetic behaviors were studied using stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. It was found that the kinetics of the acid-induced protein unfolding transformed from a triphasic process (i.e., fast, intermediate and slow phases) into a biphasic one (i.e., intermediate and slow phases) and then a single slow phase process with increasing either trehalose or NaCl concentration in the mixture. The rate constants for all the unfolding phases change slightly, while the amplitudes for the fast and intermediate phases diminish greatly with increasing the concentration of trehalose or NaCl.

The framework is validated on industrially relevant case studies varying in upstream and downstream processing train ratios, annual demands, and impurity loads. Results obtained by the framework are presented using a range of visualization tools, and indicate that the performance impact of uncertainty is a function of both the level of uncertainty and the objective being optimized, and that uncertainty can cause otherwise optimal processes to become suboptimal.

Conventional reverse-flow diafiltration utilizes an internal membrane device, but pulsed feeding causes spatial heterogeneities. In this study, the influence of conventional reverse-flow diafiltration on the yeast Hansenula polymorpha is investigated. Alternating 180 s of feeding with 360 s of non-feeding at a dilution rate of 0.2 h−1 results in an oscillating DOT signal with an amplitude of 60%. Thereby, induced short-term oxygen limitations result in the formation of ethanol and a reduced product concentration of 25%. This effect is enforced at increased dilution rate. To overcome this cyclic problem, sequential operation of three membranes is introduced. Thus, quasi-continuous feeding is achieved reducing the oscillation of the DOT signal to an amplitude of 20% and 40% for a dilution rate of 0.2 h−1 and 0.5 h−1, respectively. Fermentation conditions characterized by complete absence of oxygen limitation and without formation of overflow metabolites could be obtained for dilution rates from 0.1 h−1 to 0.5 h−1. Thus, sequential operation of three membranes minimizes oscillations in the DOT signal providing a nearly homogenous culture over time.",

     "abstract": "In this work, the dewatering of activated sludge assisted by cationic surfactants was investigated. Dose of dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (DTAB) and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) resulted in the release of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from sludge and decrease in sludge negative charge. The surfactants significantly promoted sludge dewaterability, as reflected by decreased specific resistance of filtration (SRF) and water content in sludge cakes. The treated sludge were analyzed by combined use of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. CTAB was found more effective in releasing bound water from sludge than DTAB, due to its superior surface activity and strong adsorption/bridge capacities with sludge. The specific surface area and pore size of sludge cakes declined after surfactant treatment, indicating an enhanced compressibility. With these results, the surfactant-assisted dewatering mechanism could be attributed to the integrated effects of electrostatic neutralization, enhanced compaction and release of EPS and bound water. Our study clearly characterizes the accelerated dewatering process assisted by cationic surfactants, and demonstrates that cationic surfactants could be used as a potential agent for sludge dewatering.",

This was confirmed by the kinetics of naphthalene on the beads, where its adsorption onto the beads was confirmed by pseudo-second-order kinetics. The biodegradation of naphthalene fitted well to the first-order rate model. More than 99.7% of naphthalene which was removed within 12 h, contained bentonite 2% (w/v), PVA 12% (w/v), alginate 0.3% (w/v) and 10% (v/v) initial biomass loading.

Storage stability and reusability results revealed that the ability to degrade naphthalene using beads with immobilized cells remained stable after storage at 4 °C for 35 days and being reused 8 times (12 days), respectively.

In this study, we demonstrated how sensitive ESCs are to pH, utilizing murine ESCs as a cell model and experiments conducted at three different pH conditions (pH 6.8, 7.1 and 7.4). Maintenance of culture pH was achieved via a perfused rotary bioreactor while murine ESCs were encapsulated in alginate hydrogels, which served as a three-dimensional (3D) platform and matrix support for the ESC culture. Our results showed that at pH 6.8, ESC viability was inferior to those at pH 7.1 and 7.4. Lower cardiac gene expressions and percentage of cardiac troponin-I positive cells at pH 6.8 indicated that cardiac differentiation of ESCs was significantly compromised. Concurrently, residual pluripotency of ESCs was better conserved at pH 6.8 as compared to higher pH conditions. Finally increased levels of MAPK14 and HIF-2α suggest an impact of pH on kinase and HIF regulated pathways. This study highlights how a small change in pH could significantly affect the growth and differentiation of ESCs toward cardiomyocytes. Therefore, there is an important need for good control of culture parameters such as pH in ESC cultures, so as to obtain the optimal and desired cell output.",

The immobilization of Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) on functionalized MWCNTs was evidenced by clearly viewing with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) imaging. CRL showed more Freundlich equilibrium behavior upon immobilization on annealed and octadecylamidated MWCNTs, which suggested a multilayer adsorption; while upon physical adsorption on aminated and carboxylated MWCNTs, CRL, to more extent, demonstrated a Langmuir equilibrium property, producing an enzyme monolayer. It was proven that DBDP-mediated surface-functionalization could create compatible microenvironments for enzyme immobilization, resulted in improved specific activity and thermostability. The immobilized CRL on octadecylamidated MWCNTs displayed excellent reusability and operation stability, indicating its potential for industrial application.",

     "abstract": "Previous researches have suggested that biological phosphorus removal (BPR) from wastewater could be achieved by the aerobic/extended-idle (A/EI) regime. This study further investigated the effect of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration on BPR induced by the A/EI regime. The experimental results show that 1 mg/L of DO in mixed liquor benefited the BPR performance while a higher DO level of 5 mg/L deteriorated BPR. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that the improvement at 1 mg/L of DO was due to the shift in bacterial population from glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) to polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs). The mechanism studies revealed that DO level affected the transformations of polyhydroxyalkanoates and glycogen and the activities of exopolyphosphatase and polyphosphate kinase. In addition, the BPR performances between the A/EI regime and conventional anaerobic/oxic (A/O) process were compared. The results showed that the A/EI regime drove better BPR performance than the A/O process at both low and high DO levels. More PAO and less GAO abundances in the biomass might be the principal reason for the higher BPR efficiency in the A/EI regime. Furthermore, controlling DO at a low level of 0.5 mg/L to promote BPR was demonstrated in a real municipal wastewater. The A/EI regime showed an excellent BPR performance at the low DO levels and had a better tolerance to oxygen-limited condition as compared to the A/O regime.",

The impact of the cross-linker/protein mass ratio on CLEAs activity, and its evolution with storage time were evaluated in the solventless synthesis of ethyloleate. The amount of cross-linker used showed to be a key parameter for the evolution of the catalytic activity of CLEAs during storage. Under the best conditions found, hyperactivated CALB CLEAs with up to 188% of recovered activity in ethyl oleate synthesis were obtained. In terms of hydrolytic activity mature layered CALB CLEAs showed a retained activity of 68%. The assay of dried mature layered CALB CLEAs in heptyl oleate synthesis showed catalytic activities much higher than the one exhibited by free CALB, reaching 1 h-fatty acid conversions of 14% and 2%, respectively. The high catalytic activity shown by layered CALB CLEAs, suggests that they are an interesting alternative specially for the catalysis of fatty acid esterifications in both organic and solventless medium.",

Electro-flotation was efficient in separating flocs in the mixed liquor and led to a sludge volume reduction greater than 60% after 10 min of operation at a current density of 4.72 mA cm−2. Electro-oxidation using IrO2/Ti anode was performed to improve the anaerobic degradability of sludge and resulted in a 30% increase in COD solubilization after 30 min of operation at current density of 9.45 mA cm−2. The factors affecting electro-oxidation, i.e. the gap width between anode and cathode, current density and applied voltage, were investigated to optimize the operating conditions.

This biosurfactant could reduce the surface tension of water from 65 mN/m to 35 mN/m, and interfacial tension against oil from 45 mN/m to 15 mN/m. Moreover, surface activity stability results showed that this biosurfactant was effective when the salinity was lower than 8% and the pH value was 4–9, and it was especially stable when the salinity was lower than 4% and pH was 6–7. Based on the result of gas chromatography, there was a decrease in heavy components and an increase in light components, which indicated that A. baylyi ZJ2 exhibited the biodegradability on the heavy components of crude oil. Furthermore, the ability of recovering oil from oil-saturated core showed that nearly 28% additional residual oil was displaced after water flooding.

     "abstract": "Seawater injection into oil reservoirs for purposes of secondary oil recovery is frequently accompanied by souring (increased sulfide concentrations). Production of hydrogen sulfide causes various problems, such as microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) and deterioration of crude oil. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are considered to be major players in souring. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in oil-field water are believed to be produced by microbial degradation of crude oil. The objective of this research was to investigate mechanisms of souring, focusing specifically on VFA production via crude oil biodegradation. To this end, a microbial consortium collected from an oil–water separator was suspended in seawater; crude oil or liquid n-alkane mixture was added to the culture medium as the sole carbon source, and the culture was incubated under anaerobic conditions for 190 days. Physicochemical analysis showed that preferential toluene degradation and sulfate reduction occurred concomitantly in the culture containing crude oil. Sulfide concentrations were much lower in the alkane-supplemented culture than in the crude oil-supplemented culture. These observations suggest that SRB are related to the toluene activation and VFA consumption steps of crude oil degradation. Therefore, the electron donors for SRB are not only VFA, but many components of crude oil, especially toluene. Alkanes were also degraded by microorganisms, but did not contribute to reservoir souring.",

     "abstract": "Metabolic pathway analysis facilitates understanding or designing a complex metabolic system and enables prediction of steady-state metabolic flux distributions. A serious problem of elementary mode (EM) or extreme pathway (Expa) analysis is that the computational time increases exponentially with an increase in network sizes, which makes the computation of the EMs/Expas expensive and infeasible for large-scale networks. To overcome such problems, we proposed a fast and efficient algorithm named complementary EM (cEM) analysis. To achieve the computational time improvement, we employ the EM decomposition method that explores EMs or linear combinations of them which are responsible for the metabolic flux distributions. Flux balance analysis (FBA) is used to determine possible ranges of metabolic flux distributions as the input data necessary for the EM decomposition method. The maximum entropy principle (MEP) is employed as an objective function for estimating the coefficients of cEMs. To demonstrate the feasibility of cEM analysis, we compared it with EM/Expa analysis by using two medium-scale metabolic networks of Escherichia coli and a genome-scale metabolic network of head and neck cancer cells. The cEM analysis greatly reduces the computational time and memory cost, exposing a new window for large-scale metabolic network analysis.",

All four kinds of immobilized MBP-Hep I exhibited significantly improved stability at 30 °C compared with free MBP-Hep I and their half-lives were 20–50 times that of the free MBP-Hep I. Fe3O4@SiO2-PEO-mal nanoparticles with a PEO molecular weight of 100k were best able to immobilize MBP-Hep I (Fe3O4@SiO2-PEO100k-mal-MBP-Hep I). The molecular weight distribution profiles and anticoagulant activities, obtained from heparin depolymerization by free Hep I, free MBP-Hep I and Fe3O4@SiO2-PEO100k-mal-MBP-Hep I were the same. Furthermore, Fe3O4@SiO2-PEO100k-mal-MBP-Hep I exhibited reasonable reusability during enzymatic production of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs).",

Its kinetic behavior was studied by employing three mathematical models proposed in the literature. Furthermore, a new model was proposed to describe not only the variation of triacylglycerols (TAG), diacylglycerols (DAG), and free fatty acids groups but also the acyl migration reaction occurrence. The effect of the reaction temperature on the kinetic and equilibrium parameters, as well as TAG and reaction intermediates profiles was analyzed. Increasing reaction temperature generated major changes in the overall composition of acylglycerols and gave rise to the highest composition of P + St in the obtained structured lipids (58%, 70 h, 60 °C). P + St incorporation was successfully adjusted by an empirical model (Model I) and a lumped parameter model (Model II) for all the studied reaction times, while the model based on a Ping Pong Bi Bi mechanism (Model III) was only able to describe the kinetics behavior (through the variation of reactant saturated fatty acids concentration) until 24 h. Experimental data were fit satisfactorily by the proposed model (Model IV), showing that the increment in the disaturated TAG formation achieved by the increment in temperature was principally related to the favored DAG formation from triunsaturated TAG.",

It intended to observe the experimental correlation between variable process kinetics and changes in the composition of the microbial community induced by erythromycin. Samples from two fill/draw reactors operated with continuous erythromycin dosing of 50 mg/L were collected for the analysis of microbial population structure using high-throughput sequencing of 16SrRNA gene. Significant changes were observed in the composition of microbial community during the exposure period. Richness analysis for slower growing culture indicated that most microbial fractions were inactivated and eliminated in favor of fewer more resistant species in different phyla. Sludge age appeared to control the impact of erythromycin on microbial composition. At a sludge age of 2 d, erythromycin appeared to generate richer community with faster growing and more compatible species. For slower growing culture, elimination of vulnerable species was supported by decrease in the number of shared level OTUs. For faster growing culture, shared species level OTUs also decreased significantly upon exposure to erythromycin, suggesting rapid washout and replacement by more resistant species. Resistance gene analysis yielded positive results for mph(A) gene indicating presence of erythromycin-resistant components in the microbial community.",

Results showed that the average absorption rates in the culture irradiated with blue LEDs were higher than that irradiated with red LEDs.

During the exponential growth, the highest P/V was found in baffled flasks (BF) with 0.51 kW/m3, followed by coiled flasks (CF) with 0.44 kW/m3 and normal Erlenmeyer flasks (NF) with 0.20 kW/m3 (flasks volume of 250 mL, filling with 50 mL and agitated at 150 rpm). During the stationary phase, P/V decreased 20% in BF and CF, but increased two times in NF, surely due to changes in mycelial morphology and its effects on rheology. Also, NF cultures were carried out at a filling volume and agitation of 15 mL, 150 rpm (15 mL-NF), and 25 mL, 168 rpm (25 mL-NF), in order to raise P/V closely to the values obtained in CF. However, different growth, morphology and recombinant protein productivity were obtained. These data indicate that P/V is not a definitive parameter that can determine bacteria growth and morphology, not even glycoprotein production.

The P. chrysosporium extracts possessed remarkable antioxidant activity, expressing a dose-dependent total antioxidant activity and accompanied with high reactive oxygen radical (O2–, OH and H2O2) scavenging capacity. In addition, it was established that, various compounds, such as antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) and low-molecular-weight antioxidant components (glutathione, phenolics and flavonoids) existed steadily in P. chrysosporium. Linear regression analysis and Pearson correlation coefficient analysis demonstrated that enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants took part in processes and acted as “antioxidant network” in P. chrysosporium by confirming with the significant correlation coefficients among the tested antioxidants. Furthermore, those tested antioxidants were found sensitive response to Cd exposure, a 2.78-fold and 2.35-fold of stimulation has been found in SOD and phenolics, respectively, which provide a novel dimension to the involvement of antioxidants in the antioxidant defense system of P. chrysosporium.

     "abstract": "Effective control of infectious diseases relies on new vaccine technologies that can quicken and broaden vaccine delivery. Novel modular virus-like particle (VLP) and capsomere technologies have been recently reported. These technologies utilize murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) VLPs and capsomeres as potent delivery systems to carry and display antigenic modules consisting of heterologous peptides, in the form of modular constructs capable of inducing high levels of specific antibodies against bacterial or viral antigens. These constructs are prepared using high-yield microbial synthesis, potentially enabling low-cost, rapid and scalable manufacture of new vaccines. To evaluate this potential, this study analyzes the economics of capsomere and VLP production using process simulation. Data here show that the unit production cost (UPC) for capsomere is up to 69% lower than that for VLP at the comparison scale (500 L fermentor), due to a simpler downstream process and a higher product yield. For VLP production, reactive diafiltration assembly was shown to have a UPC 30% lower than dilution assembly. Sensitivity analysis of uncertain process inputs with Monte Carlo simulations revealed a significant influence of final biomass concentration on UPC, contributing up to 50% of variance observed in the UPC probability distribution. Despite such process variability, optimized capsomere or VLP vaccine production, using a 500-L or 1500-L fermentor respectively, has more than 80% chance of producing vaccine at a cost less than 1 cent per dose based on a conservative assumption of 50 μg protein per vaccine dose. With a 10-kL fermentor, both the capsomere and VLP processes have productivity that could allow manufacture of 320 million vaccine doses in 2.3 and 4.7 days, respectively. This study confirms with quantitative data the possible economic, speed and scale benefits of the modular capsomere and VLP vaccine technologies, which can potentially redefine current vaccine distribution landscape and time-scale benchmarks.",

In response to the enhanced oxygen transfer, welan gum concentration and yield reached maxima of 33.9 ± 0.56 g/L and 0.761 ± 0.010 g/g, respectively. The DCW reached a maximum of 7.82 ± 0.18 g/L with n-dodecane addition. Welan gum productivity and yield were significantly affected by kLa under n-hexadecane addition because of the promotion of the highest transcriptional levels of genes in the metabolic flux for welan gum biosynthesis. In addition, transcription levels of TCA and electron transfer chain (ETC) genes exhibited maximum up-regulation under n-dodecane, which resulted in enhanced cell growth. These results suggest a mechanism for enhanced kLa using oxygen vectors to improve welan gum biosynthesis through regulation of transcriptional levels of ETC, TCA, and metabolic pathways for welan gum biosynthesis genes during fermentation.",

In this study, we propose a novel system to detect PPIs using the distinct domains of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). In this system named “split FAK”, the linker and kinase domains in native FAK are tethered separately to two target proteins of interest. The interaction between the target proteins brings the linker and kinase domains into proximity, which leads to phosphorylation at Y397 of the linker domain, recruitment of another tyrosine kinase Src, and phosphorylation at Y576 of the kinase domain. PPIs are readily detected by probing phosphorylation at Y397 and Y576 of these domains. To demonstrate this system, we designed a series of split FAK chimeras with different domain structures. Consequently, dimerizer-induced interaction between FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP) and the T2098L mutant of FKBP12-rapamycin binding domain (FRB) was clearly detected by probing phosphorylation at the specific tyrosine residues of most of the split FAK chimeras.

This study has investigated some phenotypic traits linked to biomass production and ammonium release in multicellular cyanobacteria, Anabaena variabilis PCC 7937. It confirms that this wild-type strain has no natural ability for ammonium excretion under diazotrophic conditions. A mutant strain, A. variabilis PCC 7937-C9, was obtained after double random mutagenesis treatments with ethyl methane–sulfonate and screening in batch cultures for resistance to the effect of a glutamine synthetase inhibitor, l-methionine-d,l-sulfoximine (MSX). Although significantly characterized by shorter cell filaments, the growth parameters in photobioreactors of the mutant strain cultures were in the same range of values than those of the wild type. In the presence of MSX this strain was shown to produce extracellular ammonium, with specific rates up to 4.9 μmol NH4+ mg Chl a−1 h−1. The efficiency of this strain, estimated by its specific rate of ammonium excretion, was shown to be improved after consecutive batch cultures with increasing concentrations of MSX.

The rheological model was developed by introducing the power law model and measuring the torque values of the mixing system in a small reactor (5 L), and then applied to the larger reactors (50 L and 500 L). The CFD model was developed based on the determined rheological properties. The fluid dynamics experiments in three reactors with different scales were used for validation of the rheological model. The calculated power consumption and mixing efficiency by CFD modeling were in good agreements with the experimental results. This study provided a practical method for the rheology characterization and CFD model at high solids loading. The CFD model could be applied to the design and structure analysis of pretreatment reactors in lignocellulose biorefining processes.",

This study aimed to improve the production of individual GAs by engineering the biosynthetic pathway of GAs in G. lucidum through the overexpression of squalene synthase (SQS) gene. SQS catalyzes the first enzymatic step from the mevalonate pathway toward triterpene biosynthesis. The effects of SQS gene overexpression on the accumulation of individual GAs and their intermediates (squalene and lanosterol) by a submerged culture of G. lucidum and on the transcription levels of GA biosynthesis genes in this mushroom were investigated. The maximum contents of GA-Mk, GA-T, GA-Me, and GA-S in G. lucidum overexpressing the SQS gene were 16, 40, 43, and 53 μg/100 mg dry cell weight, respectively, which were 2.86-, 2.67-, 1.95-, and 1.25-fold of those obtained in wild-type strain (WT). The maximum contents of squalene and lanosterol in the SQS gene-overexpression strain were 1.55- and 1.68-fold higher than those of the WT strain. The transcription levels of the biosynthetic genes encoding SQS and lanosterol synthase were up-regulated by 15.6- and 1.93-fold, respectively, in G. lucidum overexpressing the SQS gene, suggesting that increased GA biosynthesis may result from a higher expression of those genes.",

Integration of functional membranes in microfluidics, however, is nontrivial. Here, we report a simple approach for biofabricating freestanding, semi-permeable biopolymer membranes in microfluidics, initiated with intentionally trapped air bubbles caught within specifically designed polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) apertures. Pressure-driven dissipation of air bubbles through the gas permeable PDMS facilitates local and quiescent contact of two oppositely charged polyelectrolyte polysaccharides forming a layered or sandwiched membrane. This polyelectrolyte complex membrane (PECM) is permeable to ions including hydroxyl ions, which further facilitates layer-by-layer assembly of membrane stratum. Assembled membranes that bridge the 40-μm apertures are sufficiently strong to withstand >1 atmosphere hydrostatic pressure. Further, the semi-permeable membranes allow for programmed generation of small molecule gradients while preventing protein efflux. We envision the simplicity of fabrication, which requires no reagents or complicated valving, when coupled with the functional properties of the membrane polysaccharides, will find utility in cell and tissue studies including preclinical drug screening and toxicity analyses.",

Biofabrication is the emerging approach to broadly apply biology's materials and mechanisms to create structure and function. Here, we describe one such biofabrication methodology, the use of tyrosinase to graft phenolics to the aminopolysaccharide chitosan. Phenolics are a broad class of abundant natural products and we provide results from a single phenolic reactant, caffeic acid, to illustrate the potential for enzymatically imparting functional properties to chitosan. We show that tyrosinase oxidation mediates the grafting of caffeic acid to chitosan and possibly even results in the covalent crosslinking of chitosan. When this enzymatic reaction is performed in a chitosan solution (pH < 6), it is observed to induce a sol–gel transition. At higher pHs, chitosan forms an insoluble film and this enzymatic reaction can alter the film's mechanical properties. Importantly, caffeic acid grafting also confers redox-activity to the chitosan film, enabling the film to accept, store and donate electrons. The broader efforts to enlist tyrosinase to build macromolecular structures and impart functions are discussed.",

Here, we compare the ability of free histidine, a His tag peptide, His-tagged thioredoxin (TrxA, a monomeric protein), and N- and C-terminally His-tagged versions of Hsp31 (a homodimeric protein) to support the synthesis of Mn-doped ZnS nanocrystals from aqueous precursors under mild conditions of pH (8.2) and temperature (37 °C). We find that: (1) it is possible to produce poor quality QDs when histidine is used at high (8 mM) concentration; (2) an increase in local histidine concentration through repetition of the amino acid as a His tag decreases the amount of needed reagent ≈10-fold and improves optical properties; (3) fusion of the same His tag to TrxA allows for ZnS:Mn QDs mineralization at micromolar concentrations; and (4) doubling the local hexahistidine concentration by exploiting Hsp31 dimerization further improves nanocrystal luminescence with the brightest particles obtained when His tags are spatially co-localized at the Hsp31 N-termini. Although hexahistidine tracts are not as efficient as combinatorially selected ZnS binding peptides at QD synthesis, it should be possible to use the large number of available His-tagged proteins and the synthesis approach described herein to produce luminescent nanoparticles whose protein shell carries a broad range of functions.",

Cysteines in the internal cavity of the engineered caged protein scaffold (E2 variant D381C) were conjugated with maleimide-bearing Alexa Fluor 532 (AF532) and doxorubicin (DOX). The external surface was functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) alone or with the tumor-targeting ligand folic acid (FA) through a PEG linker. The resulting bi-functional nanoparticles remained intact and correctly assembled. The uptake of FA-displaying nanoparticles (D381C-AF532-PEG-FA) by cells overexpressing the folate receptor was approximately six times greater than of non-targeting nanoparticles (D381C-AF532-PEG) and was confirmed to be FA-specific. Nanoparticles containing DOX were all cytotoxic in the low micromolar range.

Cysteine was introduced as one of the middle inserted residues of the peptide for later immobilization. Then, amino acid location was performed to identify other amino acid residues for insertion, leading to the construction of a peptide library. The library was screened by using different molecular simulation protocols, resulting in the selection of 15 peptide candidates. Thereafter, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to validate the dynamics of the affinity interactions between the candidates and IgG, and 14 of them were found to keep high affinities. Finally, the affinity and specificity of the top one ligand FYWHCLDE were exemplified by protein chromatography and IgG purification.

Using statistical criteria, the Baranyi–Roberts model was chosen to estimate the growth kinetics values. Walne's mariculture medium was redesigned based on the concept of elemental balance to support higher density photoautotrophic growth. Biomass capacity of at least 100% was fixed for all micronutrient components while a sequential increase of 10% was imposed on deficient macronutrients.

Compared with the baseline photoautotrophic W-30 medium, cultivation with addition of 30 g/L glucose produced the highest Xmax at 8.08 g dry cell weight/L. This effectively provides significant algal biomass and lipid productivity of 404 mg dry cell weight/L per day and 90.9 mg lipid/L per day, respectively.",

Its sludge retention time (SRT) was 35 days and its hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 35 h. Variations in temperature did not affect the effluent COD concentration. Permeability was reduced both by the increase in membrane flux resistance (Rt) at temperatures <15 °C and by viscosity. A lower temperature produced a decrease both in the endogenous respiration rate (bH) and the observable biomass yield coefficient for heterotrophs. This effect was particularly evident in the bH and led to an upward trend in the concentration of the TSS and the VSS/TSS ratio. The system was found to have a high nitrification and denitrification potential regardless of temperature.

The first part of the analysis focuses on the collection of target DNA molecules onto a functionalized fiber in a lysis micro-reactor (LMR). Expressions are derived for hybridization rates that include convective transport. In the next step the fiber is contacted with functionalized chitosan microspheres containing horse radish peroxidase. Chitosan microspheres are conjugated to the fiber with the target DNA acting as a unique tether. The final step is the release of chitosan microspheres in a chromogenic substrate and monitoring absorption changes. The analysis provides estimates of the method sensitivity and processing time and we show that DNA with a concentration as low as 10−4 copies per milliliter can be detected in less than 30 min.

This exposure resulted in a significant increase of cell resistance to freeze–drying by comparison with cells cultivated in conventional bioreactors or in the TCB in the cold shock mode (CS-TCB).

Among the strains tested, TSIP9 converted PPF and EFB into lipid with the highest yield of 31.1 ± 1.7 mg/gram dry substrate (gds) and 37.5 ± 2.2 mg/gds, respectively. It also produced high activity of cellulolytic enzymes. It was identified as Aspergillus tubingensis. The similar fatty acids of its lipid to those of plant oil indicate its suitable use as biodiesel feedstock. The cellulase and xylanase production by this strain was improved when EFB was pretreated with alkaline. When alkaline-pretreated EFB was added with palm kernel cake (PK) as an alternative nitrogen source and the culture conditions were optimized through response surface methodology (RSM), the production of lipid, cellulase and xylanase were increased up to 88.5 ± 4.9 mg/gds, 26.1 ± 0.1 U/gds and 59.3 ± 0.3 U/gds, respectively. This study reveals the potential use of in situ cellulolytic enzymes producing fungi and the optimal conditions for direct conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into lipid.",

Batch experiments were conducted with sterilized sludge and activated sludge to explore the contributions of sludge adsorption and biodegradation for those pharmaceuticals. Notable difference of those pharmaceuticals removal efficiencies was observed, at about 92.2, 90.0, 55.4, 38.5 and 3.2% for acetaminophen, 17β-estradiol, naproxen, diclofenac sodium, and carbamazepine, respectively. Results of batch adsorption experiments via sterilized sludge showed that the removal efficiencies of five pharmaceuticals by sludge adsorption were 7.9, 68.2, 60.1, 40.1 and 71.5%, respectively, which were positively correlated with their octanol–water partition coefficients. Results of batch experiments via activated sludge showed that 83.4% of acetaminophen, 98.0% of 17β-estradiol, and 46.8% of naproxen were removed through the combination of sludge adsorption and biodegradation, while adsorption accumulation in sludge phase was only 1.8, 1.3 and 7.0%. This implies that the removals of these three drugs were mainly achieved by biodegradation. The total removal efficiency of diclofenac sodium was 19.7%, and the contributions of sludge adsorption and biodegradation were 14.9 and 4.8%, which indicated that the removal of diclofenac sodium was mainly achieved by sludge adsorption. The total removal efficiency of carbamazepine was only 8.9% and this implies that neither sludge adsorption nor biodegradation is effective for its removal.",

The study first isolates Citrobacter farmeri SC01 from an aerobic basin of a coking wastewater treatment. Then the isolated C. farmeri SC01 was used to study the metabolism of m-cresol. The findings show that the isolated C. farmeri SC01, if grown on m-cresol as the sole carbon source, can metabolically biodegrade m-cresol. By the methods of HPLC, LC–MS, FT-IR and GC–MS, the study identifies the metabolic intermediates of m-cresol biodegraded by C. farmeri SC01 under aerobic process. These intermediates are 3-hydroxybenzoic acid, cis,cis-munconate, and muconolactone, the typical ortho-cleavage metabolites formed and consumed during the degradation of m-cresol. Moreover, when growing on m-cresol as a sole carbon and energy source, C. farmeri SC01 can induce the production of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase. The findings contribute to the study of the characteristics of biodegradation, the metabolic mechanism, the properties of enzymes and the expression, and the regulation of the genes involved in the degradation of m-cresol.",

From these cultures, a reasonable system of differential equations, similar to the three-dimensional Lotka–Volterra two predators-one prey model, was set up to describe, for the first time, the relationship between the absolute rates of growth, pH drop and nisin production.Thus, the nisin production system was described as a three-species (pH, biomass and nisin) ecosystem. In this case, both nisin and biomass production were considered as two pH-dependent species that compete for the nitrogen source. Excellent agreement (R2 values ≥0.9885) resulted between model predictions and the experimental data, and significant values for all the model parameters were obtained. The developed model was demonstrated (R2 values ≥0.9874) for five batch cultivations of the strains L. lactis CECT 539 in MRS broth and Lactobacillus sakei LB 706 (sakacin A producer), Pediococcus acidilactici LB42-923 (pediocin AcH producer), L. lactis ATCC 11454 (nisin producer) and Leuconostoc carnosum Lm1 (leuconocin Lcm1 producer) in TGE broth.

     "abstract": "The scarcity of organs for liver transplant is a major pressure point of liver transplantation. Hence, generating hepatocytes may provide an alternative choice for therapeutic applications. At present, dental pulp stem cell (SCDs) is an emerging source in regenerative medicine. However, existing protocols for cell culture requires fetal bovine serum (FBS) as a nutritional supplement and may carry the risk of transmitting diseases. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to examine the efficacy of human platelet lysate (HPL) as a substitute for FBS in terms of proliferation and differentiation of SCDs into hepatic lineage cells. The result showed that HPL had displayed a superior effect on the proliferation of SCDs. Next, we induced SCDs into hepatic lineage cells which thrived by initiation and followed by maturation into functional hepatocytes for a total of 21 days. We observed that the gene, protein and its functional profile during this differentiation process reiterated in vivo liver development demonstrating a steady down-regulation of early endoderm markers (GATA4, GATA6, SOX17, HNF4α, HNF3β and AFP) with the up-regulation of hepatic specific markers (TDO, TO, TAT, ALB, AAT, CK18). We also noticed the presence of CK19 suggesting a progenitor population. To ascertain this, we checked for the expression of pluripotent markers and observed that it remained unchanged throughout the experiment period. Our results provide new insights on the ability of SCDs to differentiate into hepatic lineage cells and most remarkably, this can be done in autologous settings whereby both cell source and HPL can be derived from the same donor thus reducing the risk of disease transmission.",

The comparison involved: (1) physical characterization of oxygen mass transfer efficiency and mixing intensity, (2) growth characteristics in batch cultivation, and (3) culture performance for the production of recombinant protein. Our results show that oxygen mass transfer was comparable between the 1D RB and STR at low working volume (WV), declining linearly with increasing WV, and was highest in the 2D RB for all tested WVs with the maximum mass transfer coefficient (kLa) at 3 L WV. Well mixing behavior was observed in all three systems for water and aqueous carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solutions. Batch growth characteristics were similar in all bioreactor systems, although metabolite accumulation was significant in the 1D RB.

We therefore compared three different heat precipitation steps that remove most host cell proteins while leaving a heat-stable candidate malaria vaccine protein in solution. A design-of-experiments approach was used to test each method and analyze the resulting data, allowing us to model and optimize the corresponding process. The heat treatment of leaves was superior to both methods for the heat treatment of extracts in terms of process-scale implementation, energy consumption and speed.

     "abstract": "Production and purification of hydrophobin HFBII has recently been the subject of intensive research, but the yield of production needs to be further improved for a generic use of this molecule at industrial scale. In a first step, the influence of different carbon sources on the growth of Trichoderma reesei and the production of HFBII was investigated. The optimum productivity was obtained by using 40 g/L lactose. Carbon starvation and excretion of extracellular enzyme were determined as two main conditions for the production of HFBII. In the second phase, and according to the physiological mechanisms observed during the screening phase, a bioreactor set up has been designed and two modes of cultures have been investigated, i.e. the classical submerged fermentation and a fungal biofilm reactor. In this last set-up, the broth is continuously recirculated on a metal packing exhibiting a high specific surface. In this case, the fungal biomass was mainly attached to the metal packing, leading to a simplification of downstream processing scheme. More importantly, the HFBII concentration increased up to 48.6 ± 6.2 mg/L which was 1.8 times higher in this reactor configuration and faster than the submerged culture. X-ray tomography analysis shows that the biofilm overgrowth occurs when successive cultures are performed on the same packing. However, this phenomenon has no significant influence on the yield of HFBII, suggesting that this process could be operated in continuous mode. Protein hydrolysis during stationary phase was observed by MALDI-TOF analysis according to the removal of the last amino acid from the structure of HFBII after 48 h from the beginning of fermentation in biofilm reactor. Hopefully this modification does not lead to alternation of the main physicochemical properties of HFBII.",

The optimum environmental and nutritional conditions for arthroconidial germination in the dark control were estimated as follows: temperature, 26 °C; glucose, 20 g/L; soybean peptone, 10 g/L; Mg2+ concentration, 2 mmol/L; and initial pH, 3.5. All the arthroconidia rapidly germinated within 32 h after inoculation under optimal conditions. In the shaking flask, prepared according to the arthroconidial inoculation method, the fermentation period, maximal cell growth rate, and triterpenoid productivity of SmF were 0.6-, 1.7-, and 1.6-fold of those obtained from the culture prepared according to the conventional mycelial inoculation method. Furthermore, efficient fermentation was obtained in a 4000 L fermentor, with a biomass of 7.84 ± 0.20 g/L and a triterpenoid production of 61.21 ± 2.12 mg/L. Therefore, the modified inoculation method can be used in engineering applications with several advantages, including simplicity, good controllability, and high efficiency (shorten the operation time of mycelium-based inoculation from ≥240 h to 168 h).",

     "abstract": "The sorption of Cd(II) and Pb(II) ions was conducted in a continuous fixed-bed column by using dead calcareous skeletons (CS). The column performances were evaluated by varying the adsorbent bed height, influent flow rate and metals initial concentration. The breakthrough curve for the bed height indicated that a longer bed column prolonged the life span of the column with a maximum capacity of 26.447 and 38.460 mg/g for the Cd(II) and Pb(II) column, respectively. The increased flow rate and initial concentration caused the column exhaustion time to occur earlier. The experimental column data were also expressed in column adsorption models, namely, the Thomas, Yoon–Nelson and Adam–Bohart models. The Thomas model fitted well with the Cd(II) data with the correlated curve (r2 > 0.9). The Yoon–Nelson model was selected to predict the 50% breakthrough time achieved by the column system and provided the estimated breakthrough time for the columns that were not exhausted during the operation. The Adam–Bohart model was applicable for the initial part of adsorption with the saturation concentration data at the equilibrium. The saturation index of aragonite and calcite depicted that dissolution of calcium occurred in the aqueous solution. The experimental and theoretical data were correlated with a significant relationship trend (p < 0.01), which showed that the trend of experimental data fit well with the modeling trend. The trends of both the experimental and theoretical data were strongly and significantly correlated due to involving the column parameters and the components of CS.",

In this study, the effect of different oxygen concentrations on partial nitrification performance with a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was investigated. Results indicate that, partial nitrification of landfill leachate could be successfully achieved under the 1.0–2.0 mg L−1 dissolved oxygen (DO) condition after 118 d long-term operation, and that the effluent is suitable for an Anammox reactor. Further decreasing or increasing the DO concentration, however, would lead to a decay of nitrification performance. Additionally, the MLSS concentration in the reactor increased with increasing DO concentration. Respirometric assays suggest that low DO conditions (<2 mg L−1) favor the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and significantly inhibit nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and aerobic heterotrophic bacteria (AHB); whereas high DO conditions (>3 mg L−1) allow AHB to dominate and significantly inhibit AOB.

FCM primarily reveals the cell integrity and identifies sources of soluble organics, while 3D-EEM further characterizes them in different fermentation phases by correlation with fluorophores such as soluble protein. High correlation was obtained between fluorescence intensities of three peaks, especially those related to tryptophan-like (Ex/Em: 280/340 nm) and main soluble organics.

For enhancing mass transfer and ensuring efficient anaerobic digestion, pumping and mixing are crucial operations which are directly conditioned by the rheology of sludge. The present work aims at studying the rheological characteristics of highly concentrated anaerobic digested sludge with TS (total solid) content more than 8%. The dependence on both TS content and temperature is investigated, respectively, in dynamic and flow measurements. The results show a shear-thinning behavior with a yield stress under flow measurements and a viscoelastic property in dynamic measurements, comparable to a pasty material. The Herschel–Bulkley model can describe these experimental results and a master curve is then proposed. In addition, the yield stress as well as cohesion energy increase with TS content following a power-law. The effect of temperature is relatively smaller, as a consequence of pronounced internal interactions strengthening the interior structure after the digestion, in the form of networks and steric linking.",

N2O generation and emission was examined at three aeration rates of 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 L air/min in three IASBRs (SBR1, SBR2, and SBR3, respectively). The slaughterhouse wastewater contained chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 6057 ± 172.6 mg/L, total nitrogen (TN) of 576 ± 15.1 mg/L, total phosphorus (TP) of 52 ± 2.7 mg/L and suspended solids (SS) of 1843 ± 280.5 g/L. In the pseudo-steady state, the amount of N2O emission was up to 5.7–11.0% of incoming TN. The aeration rate negatively affected N2O emission and the ratio of N2O emission to incoming TN was reduced by 48.2% when the aeration rate was increased from 0.4 to 0.8 L air/min. Results showed that more N2O was generated in non-aeration periods than in aeration periods. Lower DO concentrations enhanced N2O generation in the aeration periods (probably via nitrifier denitrification) while low DO concentrations (lower than 0.2 mg/L) did not affect N2O generation in the non-aeration periods (probably via heterotrophic denitrification). When PHB was utilized as the organic substrate for denitrification, there was a high N2O generation potential. It was estimated that 1.8 mg N2O-N was generated accompanying per mg PHB consumed.",

Variable temperature high-tension voltage and circular dichroism spectroscopic studies on the mixtures of these proteins and the triangle-PEG showed that the triangle-PEG stabilizes carbonic anhydrase, lysozyme and phospholipase that exhibit denaturation temperatures higher than 60 °C, while substantially no stabilization was observed for citrate synthase that denatures below 60 °C. Hence, the dehydrated triangle-PEG likely interacts with partially unfolded proteins through the hydrophobic interaction to suppress protein aggregation.",

Current syngas fermentation faces several challenges with low gas–liquid mass transfer being one of the major bottlenecks. The aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor (HFM-BR) as a reactor configuration for syngas fermentation. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient (KLa) of the HFM-BR was determined at abiotic conditions within a wide range of gas velocity/flowrate passing through the hollow fiber lumen and liquid velocity/flowrate passing through the membrane module shell. The KLa values of the HFM-BR were higher than most reactor configurations such as stir tank reactors and bubble columns. A continuous syngas fermentation of Clostridium carboxidivorans P7 was implemented in the HFM-BR system at different operational conditions, including the syngas flow rate, liquid recirculation between the module and reservoir, and the dilution rate. It was found that the syngas fermentation performance such as syngas utilization efficiency, ethanol concentration and productivity, and ratio of ethanol to acetic acid depended not only on the mass transfer efficiency but also the characteristics of biofilm attached on the membrane module (biofouling or abrading of the biofilm). The HFM-BR results in a highest ethanol concentration of 23.93 g/L with an ethanol to acetic acid ratio of 4.79. Collectively, the research shows the HFM-BR is an efficient reactor system for syngas fermentation with high mass transfer.",

Moreover, PEGylation reaction conditions were investigated using the established model and the corresponding experiments to determine the optimal condition to achieve the mono-PEG-HV2 at the desired yield. The model predictions agreed well with the experimental data. Several important process parameters (maximum theoretical yield of mono-PEG-HV2 (ymax), critical PEG/HV2 molar ratio (mcrit) and reaction time to achieve ymax (tmax)) and their mathematical equations were obtained to determine the optimum reaction conditions. Among reaction conditions affecting the PEGylation rates, pH and temperature displayed little effect on ymax, but ymax increased as PEG size increased. Optimal reaction condition to produce mono-PEG-HV2 was as follows: pH and temperature could vary in a certain range; whereas PEG/HV2 molar ratio should be slightly greater than mcrit and the reaction should be stopped at tmax. The results of this study indicate that the proposed reaction kinetic model can provide a possible mechanism interpretation for real PEGylation reactions and optimize efficiently the PEGylation step.",

     "abstract": "Sugarcane bagasse and rice straw were subjected to acid and alkaline ethanolysis and sequential enzymatic hydrolysis to produce glucose for lactic acid production. Influence of physico-chemical treatments using ultrasonic bath and ultrasonic probe was studied compared with mechanical stirring. The results showed that the highest glucose yield with least contamination of xylose was obtained from acid ethanolysis fractionation (5 N H2SO4 + 50%, v/v ethanol) when stirred at 90 °C for 4 h. Alkaline ethanolysis accomplished high amount of both glucose and xylose released, however it was not favorable substrate for homofermentative lactic acid bacteria. In order to enhance enzymatic hydrolysis of acid ethanolysis fractionated samples, lignin was subsequently removed by the second step alkaline/peroxide delignification. The maximum lactic acid was obtained at 23.6 ± 0.2 g/L from Lactobacillus casei fermentation after 72 h when hydrolysate from two-step acid hydrolysis and alkaline/peroxide fractionated sugarcane bagasse containing 24.6 g/L initial glucose concentration was used as substrate.",

     "abstract": "This study illustrates the benefits of Celite® supported lipase sol–gels for the transesterification of triolein to produce methyl oleate. A ping–pong bi–bi kinetic model was developed and validated taking into account the inhibition effects of methanol and glycerol as well as the effect of temperature. Although initial reaction rate models are useful for predicting the kinetics in the absence of products, a kinetic model beyond the initial conditions that considers glycerol inhibition is important. The model developed was consistent with the experimental data (R2 = 0.95) predicting an increase in methyl oleate production with increasing methanol concentration up to an optimal range of 1.3 M to 2.0 M depending on the temperature. In general, increasing the temperature increased the initial reaction rate for the immobilized lipase over the temperature range of 40–60 °C. Based on the kinetic constants, the maximum velocity of the reverse reaction is about 25% slower than that of the forward reaction and glycerol inhibition has a more significant effect on the reaction kinetics than methanol inhibition. The model developed would be useful for understanding the effects of methanol and glycerol inhibition as well as temperature on the production of methyl oleate using lipase-mediated enzymatic transesterification.",

Among the different solutions investigated up to now, the biological processes are capable of achieving complete degradation of the biodegradable compounds contained in the OMWs and therefore to significantly reduce the pollutant load. However, further studies still need to be performed in order to find out the optimal bioreactor and the best operating conditions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficiency of a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) in the biological treatment of OMWs. Different influent organic loadings (0.08, 0.11, 0.19 and 0.69 mg COD mg MLVSS−1 d−1) were applied and their effects on chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total polyphenols (TPPs) removal determined. Furthermore, it was evaluated the possibility to add a pre- or a post-treatment through different membrane separation steps, namely ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO).The SBR always showed high performances, achieving complete removal of the biodegradable organic content at all the investigated influent loadings, with average efficiencies constantly at about 90% and 60% for COD and TPPs, respectively. These values increased up to 92% and 78%, respectively, when the OMWs were added with nutrient.The membrane separation stage posed down flow the SBR process was capable of further improving the effluent quality and to comply with the limits posed on COD, pH and conductivity for discharge or reuse according to the Italian legislation. However, the residual polyphenols content was still above the concentration limit required for reuse.",

     "abstract": "The use of hMSCs for allogeneic therapies requiring lot sizes of billions of cells will necessitate large-scale culture techniques such as the expansion of cells on microcarriers in bioreactors. Whilst much research investigating hMSC culture on microcarriers has focused on growth, much less involves their harvesting for passaging or as a step towards cryopreservation and storage. A successful new harvesting method has recently been outlined for cells grown on SoloHill microcarriers in a 5 L bioreactor [1]. Here, this new method is set out in detail, harvesting being defined as a two-step process involving cell ‘detachment’ from the microcarriers’ surface followed by the ‘separation’ of the two entities. The new detachment method is based on theoretical concepts originally developed for secondary nucleation due to agitation. Based on this theory, it is suggested that a short period (here 7 min) of intense agitation in the presence of a suitable enzyme should detach the cells from the relatively large microcarriers. In addition, once detached, the cells should not be damaged because they are smaller than the Kolmogorov microscale. Detachment was then successfully achieved for hMSCs from two different donors using microcarrier/cell suspensions up to 100 mL in a spinner flask. In both cases, harvesting was completed by separating cells from microcarriers using a Steriflip® vacuum filter. The overall harvesting efficiency was >95% and after harvesting, the cells maintained all the attributes expected of hMSC cells. The underlying theoretical concepts suggest that the method is scalable and this aspect is discussed too.",

     "abstract": "Soft-sensors are software based process monitoring systems/models. In real-time they estimate those process variables, which are difficult to measure online or whose measurement by analytical procedures is tedious and time-consuming. In this study, the genetic programming (GP), an artificial intelligence based data-driven modeling formalism, has been introduced for the development of soft-sensors for biochemical processes. The novelty of the GP is that given example input–output data, it searches and optimizes both the form (structure) and parameters of an appropriate linear/nonlinear data-fitting model. In this study, GP-based soft-sensors have been developed for two bioprocesses, namely extracellular production of lipase enzyme and bacterial production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) copolymer. While in case study-I, the soft-sensor predicts the time-dependent lipase activity (U/ml), in case study-II it predicts the amount of accumulated polyhydroxyalkanoates (% dcw). The prediction and generalization performance of the GP-based soft-sensors was compared with the corresponding multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network and support vector regression (SVR) based soft-sensors. This comparison indicates that in the first case study the GP-based soft-sensor with the training and test set correlation coefficient (root-mean-squared-error) magnitudes of >0.96 (≈0.962 U/ml) has clearly outperformed the two other soft-sensors. In case study-II involving bacterial copolymer production, the GP and SVR based soft-sensors have performed equally well (correlation coefficient ≈ 0.98) while the MLP based soft-sensor's performance was relatively inferior (correlation coefficient ≈ 0.94).",

     "abstract": "Starch usually soils industrial process equipment, hence demanding specific washing procedures to ensure optimal products and reliable process performance. α-Amylases have been included in detergent formulations to hydrolyse starch making easier its elimination. Ozone is frequently used as disinfectant but could also help to remove the starchy soils improving the cleaning process. To study the effect of ozone on the enzyme, the ozonation of an α-amylase from Bacillus licheniformis at pH 7.5 and 25 °C was carried out. Enzyme activity assays showed that the relative α-amylase activity after ozonation decreased with increasing ozone/enzyme molar ratio exponentially. On the other hand, the ozone concentration after the reaction was negligible as some enzymatic activity remained, being the ozone consumption fast due to the high reaction kinetics of aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids residues of the enzyme. The UV and MALDI-TOF mass spectra confirmed the oxidation of these amino acids, while the peptide bonds were unaffected. Therefore the loss of the α-amylase activity observed would be caused by the oxidation of amino acids residues directly involved in the hydrolysis mechanism such as tyrosine and histidine and/or by denaturation of the enzyme upon amino acid residues oxidation.",

The performance of a four-module tubular MFC was determined at six different organic loadings (0.036–6.149 g sCOD L−1 d−1) in terms of power generation, COD removal efficiency, coulombic efficiency (CE) and energy conversion efficiency (ECE). A power density of 3.1 W m−3 was observed at the OLR = 0.572 g sCOD L−1 d−1, which resulted in the highest CE (60%) and ECE (0.8%), but the COD removal efficiency decreased at higher organic loading rates (35.1–4.4%).

However, the energy recovery by the MFC is only reported for a four-module reactor and improved performance can be expected with an extended module count, as chemical energy remained available for further electrogenesis.",

Their potential use in clinical applications requires the efficient production of differentiated cells at large scale. Glucose, amino acid, and oxygen metabolism play a key role in MSC and PSC expansion and differentiation. This review summarizes recent advances in the understanding of stem cell metabolism for reprogramming, self-renewal, and lineage commitment. From the reported data, efficient expansion of stem cells has been found to rely on glycolysis, while during differentiation stem cells shift their metabolic pathway to oxidative phosphorylation. During reprogramming, the reverse metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis has been observed. As a consequence, the demands for glucose and oxygen vary upon different phases of stem cell production. Accurate understanding of stem cell metabolism is critical for the rational design of culture parameters such as oxygen tension and feeding regime in bioreactors towards efficient integrated reprogramming, expansion, and differentiation processes at large scale.",

In the current study a new strategy, based on lactic acid accumulation from sludge and food waste, was introduced to significantly increase the yield of propionic acid-enriched VFA. First, the effect of different temperature on the two-stage fermentation was fully discussed. Both advantages and disadvantages of the fermentation in different temperatures were elaborated. Furthermore, the proposed metabolic pathway at 35 °C and 50 °C was introduced. It was observed that by initially controlling temperature at 50 °C for 4 h and subsequently at 35 °C for 2 d, the steady and maximal accumulation of lactic acid was obtained in the first stage, which resulted in the yield of propionic acid-enriched VFA in the second stage being increased to 15.3 g COD/L and the percentage of propionic acid in VFA reaching 69.9%.",

     "abstract": "Semiconductor quantum dot particles have a wide range of applications in medicine, bioassays, computing and photovoltaics. Biological synthesis is an attractive approach for mass production of quantum dots as cells have the capacity to passivate the particles with organic ligands. In this work, hairy roots of Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) were used to produce CdS nanoparticles with quantum dot properties. Treatment of the roots with 100 μM Cd during the mid-growth phase of batch culture elicited cellular responses for Cd detoxification without affecting root growth. A combination of freeze-drying and freeze-thawing of the roots was used to extract Cd from the biomass; anion-exchange chromatography was then applied to selectively remove metal–phytochelatin complexes. Size-fractionation using gel filtration allowed the recovery of phytochelatin-capped Cd- and inorganic sulphide-containing nanoparticles displaying the size and size-dependent optical/electronic properties of CdS quantum dots. At 4–10 nm in diameter, these particles fluoresced at wavelengths corresponding to blue-violet on the colour spectrum and exhibited a high level of photostability with prolonged excitation. Whereas 69% of the Cd extracted from the roots was associated with phytochelatin peptides, the maximum yield of CdS nanocrystals with quantum dot properties was 1.4% of the total Cd taken up into the biomass. This work demonstrates a new culture-based approach for the biosynthesis of metallo-organic semiconductor quantum dots using hairy roots.",

Three systems consisting of (i) a single-stage UASB (upflow anaerobic sludge bed) reactor, (ii) a CSTR (continuous stirred-tank reactor) coupled to a sedimentation tank and a subsequent UASB reactor and (iii) the same CSTR–UASB reactor scheme, although with biomass recirculation taking place from the sedimentation tank to the CSTR, were tested during three successive experimental periods (i.e. periods I, II and III, respectively). Acidifying biomass recirculation resulted in complete carbohydrate fermentation in the CSTR, while partial acidification occurred in the absence of biomass recycling. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed that acidifying biomass was dominated by bacteria rather than yeasts. The OLR (organic loading rate) in the UASB reactor highly correlated with the specific biogas production rate (p < 0.01), although biogas composition differed significantly among the three periods. The enhanced acidification system was capable to ensure up to 90% COD (chemical oxygen demand) removal in the UASB reactor and optimum methane yield values (i.e. 0.37 Nm3 CH4 kg−1 CODrem). Moreover, recirculation of the acidifying biomass eliminated alkali addition under any OLR tested. Two-stage configurations has been proved superior in terms of process efficiency and methane recovery as compared to the single-stage system, while the enhanced acidification process resulted in optimum operational and performance features. A case study of a two-stage anaerobic digestion system for a small-to-medium size cheese production plant indicated a net profit of 0.94 € m−3 CW from biogas production and valorization.",

We provide a new strategy to induce the early lineage commitment of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) toward a cardiomyogenic fate through the formation of cell aggregates. A surface-immobilized polyamidoamine dendrimer with fifth generation of dendron structure was used during the culturing of hMSCs. These hMSCs cultured on the G5 surface formed aggregates through active migration and division. More than 22% of cardiac troponin-T (cTnT)-positive (cTnT+) cells in aggregates formed on the dendrimer surface; the population formed on the dendrimer surface was higher than that in conventional culture vessel. When cell aggregate was reseeded onto a fresh G5 surface, single cells migrated out of the aggregates, proliferated, and formed new aggregates. This passage method, accompanied with repetitive aggregate dispersion and formation, was applied to cultures over 40 days. The proportion of cTnT+ cells increased to 62% by the end of third passage. Our results suggest that culturing hMSCs on G5 surface results in directed commitment of the hMSCs toward a cardiomyocyte-like fate.",

The MA-ILC matrix gel was first prepared by immobilizing liposomes modified with functional ligands. The functional ligand used to adsorb metal ions was N-hexadecyl iminodiacetic acid (HIDA), which is obtained by attaching a long alkyl chain to an iminodiacetic acid (IDA). Cu(II) ion was first adsorbed on the gel matrix through its complex formation with the HIDA on the surface of the immobilized liposome. Synthetic peptides of various types ranging in size from 5 to 40 residues were then used, and their retention properties on the MA-ILC were evaluated. The retention property of peptides on the MA-ILC by using a usual imidazole elution was compared with the retention property in the case of the immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and an immobilized liposome chromatography (ILC). It was found that the retention property of peptides on the MA-ILC has the features of both the IMAC and the ILC; the retention ability of peptides depends on both the number of histidine residues in peptides and the liposome membrane affinity of the peptides. Histidine and tryptophan residues among amino acid residues in peptides indicated a high contribution coefficient for the peptide retention on the MA-ILC, probably due to their metal ion and membrane interaction properties, respectively.",

Additionally, if perturbation experiments are carried out at near-neutral pH levels, also the inter conversion of dissolved carbon dioxide and bicarbonate needs to be taken into account. While developing such a model we found that for an accurate description of the systems dynamic response on a time-scale of seconds, it is required to incorporate not only the mass transfer between gas bubbles and broth, but also between headspace and broth. The delay and dispersion in the measurements of the gas analyser, due to the length and complexity of the offgas system, was accounted for by determining the impulse response of the offgas system. This model could be fitted excellently to an identification data set. Finally the model was successfully applied to reconstruct the dynamic rates of O2 uptake and CO2 production of a culture of Penicillium chrysogenum, which was perturbed by a glucose pulse.",

First, the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (KLa), which is important for the interpretation of respirometric data, was determined under an exhaustive set of experimental conditions. KLa ranged from 2.2 to 48.0 h−1, which is similar to KLa typically found in standard respirometers.

The selected cultures were Pseudomonas putida F1, Nitrobacter winogradskyi, an activated sludge and a nitrifying consortium. Additionally to reporting parameters for these cultures, this report shows that the microrespirometry method allowed for the determination of stoichiometric and kinetic parameters.

The membrane configuration impacted the efficiency of the enzyme-immobilization as well as the biocatalytic-membrane reaction, and the “sandwich mode”, with an extra polypropylene support above the membrane skin layer, worked best due to its high flux and stable conversion. Among the membranes, a GR51PP polysulphone membrane allowed for the highest flux during the reaction with the enzyme-immobilized membrane. At the same time, the lowest enzyme loading and low reaction stability were achieved for this membrane. Satisfactory enzyme loadings, stable conversions, but low flux rates were obtained for the PLTK and PLGC regenerated cellulose membranes.

Enantiomeric ratio of the esterase toward rac-3-cyano-5-methylhexanoic acid ethyl ester was significantly increased from 33 to 80 by addition of 50% (v/v) DMSO and key reaction parameters optimization. The whole-cell catalysts exhibited strong tolerance against high DMSO concentration up to 80% (v/v). Enzymatic resolution of the substrate at a concentration of 100 mM gave (S)-3-cyano-5-methylhexanoic acid in 44.6 mM and 95.1% ee, which greatly increased the feasibility of this bioprocess to become an industrial approach.",

     "abstract": "In the present work, we formulate parameter estimation problems for kinetic models of large-scale dynamic biotechnological systems. We propose dynamic models of increasing complexity for metabolic networks and continuous bioreactors. The differential algebraic equations (DAE) system for the metabolic network represent the glycolysis, the phosphotransferase system and the pentose-phosphate pathway of Escherichia coli, with modifications proposed for several enzyme kinetics. The most sensitive parameters have been ranked by performing global sensitivity analysis on the dynamic metabolic network. Since the kinetic parameters for the enzymes have been obtained from in vitro experiments, the formulation of a detailed kinetic model for the metabolic network allows parameter adjustment for in vivo conditions. We formulate an unstructured non-segregated model for a chemostat to study the dynamic response to a glucose pulse in a continuous culture of E. coli. Moreover, we perform parameter estimation by formulating a maximum likelihood problem, subject to the DAE systems, within a control vector parameterization approach. Nine kinetic parameters in the metabolic network model have been estimated with good agreement with published experimental data. For the bioreactor model, seven parameters have been tuned based on experimental data obtained in this work. Numerical results show a good agreement between the observed data and the predicted profiles.",

In this study, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) was used as an excellent buffer that can keep the DIC concentration high without its significant loss for open systems within a benign pH window for the growth of Chlorella vulgaris. The use of NaHCO3 along with CO2 gas under agitation could significantly enhance the growth rate by overcoming the DIC limitation for photosynthesis. The photosynthesis reaction was found to be limited by DIC concentration at an initial growth stage and subsequently by light availability at a later growth stage. A high concentration of NaHCO3 helps increase a DIC concentration for photosynthesis, but was found to be limited by its salinity generated by Na+ for this freshwater green alga, C. vulgaris.",

     "abstract": "Unbaffled stirred tanks are increasingly recognized as a viable alternative to common baffled tanks for a range of processes where the presence of baffles is undesirable for some reason. For instance, in the case of shear sensitive cell cultivation (e.g. human cells), unbaffled tanks have been recently found to be able to provide sufficient mass transfer through the free surface vortex. As a consequence the need for bubble formation and subsequent bursting, along with relevant cells damage, is conveniently avoided. In this work the influence of impeller geometry on mass transfer performance and power demand of an unbaffled stirred vessel operating both in sub-critical conditions (the free surface vortex has not yet reached the impeller) and in super-critical conditions (the free surface vortex has reached the impeller and a gas phase is ingested and dispersed inside the reactor) is presented.Experimental results show that the mass transfer performance of unbaffled systems is mainly affected by specific power consumption. Among the stirrer geometries investigated a simple PBT was found to provide the most interesting oxygen transfer performance in the sub-critical regime, and can therefore be regarded as a particularly suitable stirrer for shear sensitive cultures. As regards the super-critical regime, unbaffled tanks are found to provide a performance comparable with that of the standard (baffled) bioreactors, hence resulting in a viable alternative also for fermentations involving robust cells.",

It is an essential fatty acid as the human body lacks the ability to produce it in vivo and must be supplemented through diet. Microbial EPA represents a potential commercial source. GC/MS analyses confirmed that bacterial isolate 717, similar to Shewanella pacifica on the basis of 16S rRNA sequencing, is a potential high EPA producer. Two types of bioreactors, a Stirred Tank Reactor (STR) and an Oscillatory Baffled Reactor (OBR), were investigated in order to choose the optimum system for EPA production. The EPA production media was optimised through the selection of media components in a Plackett–Burman (PB) design of experiment followed by a Central Composite Design (CCD) to optimise the concentration of medium components identified as significant in the Plackett–Burman experiment. The growth conditions for the bioreactor, using artificial sea water (ASW) medium, were optimised by applying Response Surface Methodology (RSM). This optimisation strategy resulted in an increase in EPA from 33 mg/l (10 mg/g biomass), representing 8% of the total fatty acids at shake flask level, to 350 mg/l (46 mg/g biomass) representing 25% of the total fatty acids at bioreactor level. During this study the main effects and the interactions between the bioreactor growth conditions were revealed and a polynomial model of EPA production was generated.

To address this issue, the expansion of human AFSCs in 3-dimensional (3-D) polyethylene terephthalate (PET) scaffolds in a stirred bioreactor was evaluated. The results showed that 3-D PET scaffold with in vivo-like environment and a large specific surface area for cell adhesion promoted cell expansion (66-fold vs. 38-fold) compared to 2-D culture. A dynamic fibrous bed bioreactor (FBB) was used to expand AFSCs to reach a high cell density of 3.2 × 106 cells/mL. The bioreactor-expanded cells maintained clonogenic ability and high levels of expression (95.5–99.8%) of characteristic stem cell surface makers, including CD29, CD44, CD90 and CD105.

The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris induces alcohol oxidase (AOX) in the presence of methanol, which is highly nonspecific to other primary alcohols, and can oxidize them to their aldehyde form without further degradation, such as benzyl alcohol (BA) to BZA. In this work BA and BZA inhibition on P. pastoris cell growth was determined with an IC50 at 0.98 g L−1 for BZA and 2.95 g L−1 for BA, which are low levels and are undesirable for high biotransformation rates. Product detoxification, and not low AOX and low cellular energy source, was found to most improve the biotransformation rates, which prompted the application of in situ product removal (ISPR) using the thermoplastic polymer Hytrel 3078, fabricated into pervaporation tubing by DuPont, Canada. Hytrel 3078, chosen for its high partition coefficient (PC) for BZA and its low PC for BA, was characterized by available tubing surface area and permeate gas flow rate in terms of its BZA/BA flux, showing that permeate gas flow rate has a greater positive influence on flux. Finally, the integrated in situ pervaporation biotransformation was effective at continuous product separation, using 87.4% less polymer in comparison to studies with the use of polymer beads, and improved overall volumetric productivity of 214% (245.9 mg L−1 h−1vs. 115.0 mg L−1 h−1) over previous studies producing BZA.",

This work describes a comprehensive engineering characterisation of a novel, single-use 24-well parallel miniature bioreactor system. Cell culture performance is also investigated, with particular focus on the aeration strategies adopted at this small scale (7 mL) either by headspace sparging alone or by direct gas sparging into the culture medium.Apparent volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient (kLa) values ranged between 3–22 h−1 and 4–53 h−1 for headspace aeration and direct gas sparging respectively. The higher kLa values with direct gas sparging correlated directly with the increase in gas–liquid interfacial area per unit volume. Mixing times (tm) over a range of conditions were generally in the range 1–13 s and decreased with increasing shaking frequency (500–800 rpm). Direct gas sparging also served to reduce tm values by a factor of up to 19 fold.The impact of aeration strategies on cell culture kinetics of a model CHO cell line was also determined. Cultures performed with head space aeration alone showed the highest viable cell density (VCD) (15.2 × 106 cells mL−1), viability retention and antibody titre (1.58 g L−1). These were greater than in conventional shake flask cultures due to the improved control of the μ24 bioreactor system. In all cases the miniature bioreactor managed good control of process parameters such as pH 6.95 ± 0.4, temperature T°C 37 ± 0.4 and DO% 57 ± 32. Cultures performed with direct gas sparging showed a 25–45% reduction in VCD (depending on the aeration strategy used) and a similar reduction in antibody titre. Overall this work shows the successful application of the miniature bioreactor system for industrially relevant fed-batch cultures and highlights the impact of the dispersed gas phase on cell culture performance at the small scale.",

Culture of the OPNA strain in shake flaks containing PY-sucrose medium significantly improved growth and PHB production with respect to the results obtained from the cultures with the parental strain (OP).

The potential targets were revealed for higher ascomycin production, which were the amplification of carbon flux toward shikimic acid by enhancing 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) activities and eliminating the feedback inhibition of aromatic amino acids on DAHPS activities, and the elevation of FkbO activities by amplifying fkbO gene to increase the flux of shikimic acid to chorismic acid further to 4,5-dihydroxycyclohex-1-enecarboxylic acid in Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. ascomyceticus. The results indicated that the developed methods would be helpful for ascomycin large scale fermentation. Moreover, the potential targets revealed in this study are valuable to engineer the higher-yield ascomycin-producing strain, as well as other analogous macrolide compounds-producing strains.",

     "abstract": "Although developed as an empirical model to describe microbial growth on soluble substrates, the Contois equation has been widely accepted for kinetic modeling of insoluble substrate degradation. Yet, the mechanistic basis underlining these successful applications remains unanswered. Unlike soluble substrates that mainly cultivate suspended cultures, microbes cultivated on insoluble substrates have the populations that attach to the substrate surface or remain suspended in the bulk solution, while those attached usually grow faster than those suspended due to their proximity to food resources. This imbalanced growth provides a plausible explanation to the inverse relationship between microbial concentration and their specific growth rate as conveyed in the Contois equation. Based on a theoretical derivation, this study revealed that the Contois equation holds true only when attached microbes substantially obstruct the access of food to their suspended counterparts. On the other hand, when plentiful insoluble substrate surfaces are exposed for cell attachment, the Contois equation will be reduced back to the classic Monod equation.",

The Kans grass biomass was hydrolyzed in such a manner that the two sugar fractions, xylose rich and glucose rich were generated (a separate study). The P. stipitis cells and respective fermentation media (xylose rich) were fed to the fermentation vessel, after the set fermentation time Z. mobilis cells and respective media were fed to the same vessel. Different strategies have been followed and experiments were conducted initially at flask level. The selected strategy was then applied at bioreactor level using both synthetic fermentation media and Kans grass hydrolysate media to compare the kinetic parameters. The sequential addition of cultures with their respective media and imposed process conditions, showed better utilization of total sugars added (>95%). Microaerobic condition for P. stipitis and strictly anaerobic condition for Z. mobilis fermentation were found significant. The average ethanol yield (Yp/s) and overall volumetric productivity (rpo) were found as 0.453 gp/gs and 1.580 g/l/h respectively for Kans grass hydrolysate media and 0.474 gp/gs and 2.901 g/l/h respectively for synthetic fermentation media.",

Whereas sucrose exhibited Michaelis–Menten behavior with substrate inhibition, 1-kestose and nystose followed Michaelis–Menten and sigmoid enzyme kinetics. In addition, the enzyme was competitively inhibited by glucose and exhibited significant hydrolytic activity in the presence of nystose.The overall model was simultaneously fitted to experimental data from three initial sucrose concentrations (0.5, 1.5 and 2.1 M) using a multi-response regression with kinetic parameters that have biochemical relevance and are independent of the enzyme concentration.

The aeration rate (AR) or oxygen mass transfer coefficient (kLa) demonstrated a significant role in controlling cell (Candida guilliermondii FTI 20037) regeneration and bioconversion performance in free and immobilized cell systems. In the free cell system, an aeration rate of 1.25 vvm corresponding to kLa of 15.8 1/h resulted in maximum values of product yield (Yp/s: 0.87 g/g), productivity (Qp: 0.57 g/l/h), and final xylitol concentration (Pf: 55 g/l) from the hydrolysate with a 74.5 g/l xylose concentration. However, in the aerated immobilized cell system, maximum and almost similar results (almost Pf: 54 g/l, Qp: 0.57 g/l/h and Yp/s: 0.84 g/g) were obtained with aeration rates from 1.25 to 1.5 vvm using composites based on polypropylene (PP) and partially delignified fiber (PDF). Composites based on acid treated fiber (ATF) containing a high amount of lignin showed some inhibitory impact on xylose uptake and xylitol formation (Pf: 47 g/l and Qp < 0.49 g/l/h) with the optimal aeration rate of 1.5 vvm in the initial cycle of the bioconversion; this inhibition impact could be resolved in the next consecutive cycles.

Results reaching 99% cell recovery were obtained under various conditions examined. The result of bubble size distribution showed that mean bubble size increased as microbubble diffuser pore size was increased. Also, cell recovery efficiency was a function of both bubble size and particle size (cell size). For smaller particles (<50 μm), relatively smaller bubbles (<80 μm) were found to be more effective for recovery, otherwise, relatively larger bubbles (80–150 μm) proved to be efficient in recovering larger particles (particle size: ∼250 μm). Acidic and neutral pHs were effective in separation as hydrophobic particles were formed. As pH tends toward alkalinity, flocs become more hydrophilic, leading to low recovery from the aqueous solution. In addition, separation efficiency was dependent on flocculant dose as increase in concentration improved flocculation and consequently, yeast recovery. However, above a critical concentration, overdosing occurred and inadvertently, recovery efficiency decreased. The application of chitosan as a bioflocculant and the subsequent application of microflotation for the separation of yeast cells proved effective and promises several advantages over non-bubble based separation techniques that preclude continuous industrial-scale production.",

The immobilisation yield exceeded 90% using ionic binding, while it was low using amino-ethyl agarose (25–28%) and very low using glyoxal agarose (<3%). This was due to the mild conditions and absence of chemical reagents in ionic binding, compared to covalent attachment. The maximum GOS yield obtained using DEAE-Cellulose and Q-Sepharose was similar to that obtained using free BbgIV (49–53%), indicating the absence of diffusion limitation and mass transfer issues. For amino-ethyl agarose, however, the GOS yield obtained was lower (42–44%) compared to that obtained using free BbgIV. All the supports tried significantly (P < 0.05) increased the BbgIV operational stability and the GOS synthesis productivity up to 55 °C. Besides, six successive GOS synthesis batches were performed using BbgIV immobilised on Q-Sepharose; all resulted in similar GOS yields, indicating the possibility of developing a robust synthesis process. Overall, the GOS synthesis operation performance using BbgIV was improved by immobilising the enzyme onto solid supports, in particular on Q-Sepharose.",

To overcome this problem, we developed an Escherichia coli expression system that produces milligram quantities of circularly closed sortase A; efficient enzyme cyclization was achieved by Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 intein-mediated post-translational splicing. The structural integrity of circular sortase A and its biochemical characteristics were compared to those of the linear enzyme analog and were found to be similar under native conditions. Additionally, the modified sortase was active at concentrations of urea up to 3 M and was capable of efficient catalytic protein–protein coupling, as shown by the ligation of purified glutathione-S-transferase and green fluorescence protein. In contrast to the circular enzyme, linear sortase A was unable to mediate the ligation of substrate proteins under the same conditions. Therefore, the proposed circular sortase A has improved enzymatic properties and has applications in advanced protein engineering and design.",

For example, batch reactions can be difficult when there is a gas phase reactant or when there is significant product or substrate inhibition. Here we describe a repeated-batch method for measuring the half-life of carbonic anhydrase (CA)-based biocatalysts by automated periodic switching between a forward and reverse reaction. This method is inexpensive and can be multiplexed for high-throughput analysis of enzyme variants. Several purified CA enzymes as well as whole-cell biocatalysts with engineered CA activity were evaluated with this method. The results indicate a significant increase in operational stability is achieved upon immobilization of CA in the cellular periplasm of Escherichia coli.",

The intermediate is the majority species over a range of denaturant concentrations (∼4–6 M urea; ∼2–4 M guanidine HCl). Thermal unfolding resulted in reversible unfolding of the toxin domain at pH 8, but at pH 6 thermal unfolding was convoluted with aggregation due to irreversible unfolding and aggregation for the VH/VL domain.

Sludge age affected the nature of inhibition, indicating different process kinetics for faster growing microbial community.

In our study, spinosyns were used, as an example, to study the positive effect of exogenous fatty acids on their production. In the presence of exogenous fatty acids, gene expression assays indicated that the transcription of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis was significantly decreased and the transcriptions of β-oxidation and spinosad biosynthesis were up-regulated. The decreased de novo fatty acid synthesis transcription and the increased β-oxidation transcription resulted in the increase of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. It is the up-regulated spinosad pathway coupling with the enhanced concentration of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA that contributed to the increase of spinosad.

The best derivative was obtained by immobilizing the enzyme on chitosan coagulated with KOH and activated with glutaraldehyde, both steps carried out at 50 °C. The immobilization yield and recovered activity were 100%. Maximum activity was achieved at pH 7.0 and 45 °C for both soluble and immobilized β-gal. The maximum β-gal load immobilized on chitosan-glutaraldehyde support was around 21 mg of enzyme per gram of support. Immobilized β-gal was 3–5-fold more stable than the soluble enzyme at 40 and 20 °C, respectively. The biocatalyst retained 80% of its initial activity after 3 months at 10 °C and pH 7.0 in the presence of the cofactors Mn2+ and Mg2+, twice more stable than soluble enzyme. The immobilized biocatalyst was capable to efficiently hydrolyze lactose into the whole milk at 25 °C (above 95% conversion), showing similar performance after four consecutive batches.",

     "abstract": "For predicting microbial metabolism in low energy yielding environments, various rate laws have been proposed to account for the effects of thermodynamic state (as a measure of product-inhibition) as well as maintenance requirements on energetics of mediated reactions. Explicit or implicit modeling of simplified ATP reactions allows distinction between energy and ATP producing (catabolic, treated as kinetic and reversible) and energy and ATP consuming (anabolic) processes including maintenance requirements. Here, we provide a comparison of several approaches for modeling microbial metabolism in anaerobic environments considering thermodynamic factors, and maintenance energy requirements. We develop a mathematical model for microbial metabolism in anaerobic systems, which couples catabolic and anabolic processes considering the limiting effects of intermediate concentrations on reaction rate through the reduction of chemical potential and reversibility, and that explicitly partitions energy (ATP) allocation between cell growth and maintenance. We include an approach where maintenance energy requirements are assumed to take precedence over ATP-consuming cell synthesis reactions. Also, substrate utilization terminates when the catabolic reactions reach thermodynamic equilibrium with respect to ATP formation, including maintenance energy. The comparison of the proposed model to other modeling approaches shows the benefits of incorporating product inhibition and maintenance requirements in situations which maintenance energy requirements are comparable in size to growth energy requirements. An example application is also presented, where the proposed model is applied to an experimental study of arsenate reduction by Bacillus arsenicoselenatis conducted by Blum et al. (Arch Microbiol. 171 (1998) 19-30), in which the rate of metabolism is controlled by thermodynamics.",

In this work, it was proved that apart from carbon substrate feeding other factors played a crucial role in lovastatin formation. These were redox potential level, air flow rate and carbonate carbon assimilation rate. Thus, their impact was also thoroughly examined. Under the conditions of the elevated redox potential, both initial and feeding carbon substrates were faster utilised, which led to the enhancement of lovastatin production. In the process with the highest redox potential levels maximum lovastatin concentration was equal to 83.8 mgLOV l−1, while at the lowest redox level it did not reach 67 mgLOV l−1. In turn, carbonate carbon as well as organic carbon were considerably better assimilated at the higher aeration rates, which also positively influenced lovastatin formation.

The results clearly demonstrate that the increased NAD(H) pool size and the decreased NADH/NAD+ ratio improved the glucose consumption and cell growth, which improved succinic acid production. When the pncB and the nadD genes were co-overexpressed in CA102, the ratio of NADH/NAD+ was decreased from 0.60 to 0.12, and the concentration of NAD(H) was the highest among that of all the strains. Moreover, the dry cell weight (DCW), glucose consumption, and the concentration of succinic acid in CA102 were also the highest. Based on the sufficient NAD+ supply after gene modification in the NAD(H) biosynthetic pathways, reductive carbon sources with different amounts of NADH can further change the distribution of metabolites.

The perturbed systems involved two different DNA synthesis inhibitors, thymidine and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). This approach enables the establishment of characteristic cyclin profiles, timings, and thresholds. In particular, two G1 class cyclins (D1 and E1), and one G2 cyclin (B1) were investigated. Cyclin B1 showed a clear cell cycle phase-specific expression increasing during G2 phase where it was approximately 40% higher when compared to G1 phase. Similarly, cyclin E1 showed a clear pattern being expressed approximately 10% higher in G1 compared to G2 phase and decreased through S phase.

The sorption and biodegradation of these compounds were examined when they were individually or simultaneously tested. The sorption of individual compounds was significantly low except from RNT (Kd = 0.42 L/g). In contrast, the sorption of SMX and CFN increased in detriment of RNT when all the pharmaceutical compounds were simultaneously present. The biodegradation removal also exhibited significant differences. Thus, the simultaneous treatment showed higher biodegradation rates (Kb up to 97.55 × 10−6 L/mg h) than the individual treatment (Kb up to 8.13 × 10−6 L/mg h) of the pharmaceuticals. In general, the simultaneous treatment leads to increased sorption distribution coefficients and biodegradation rates. Results seem to reveal that the enhanced biomass efficiency on the simultaneous elimination process was due to the synergistic effects of pharmaceutical compounds onto mixed-culture. During the simultaneous removal, CFN, SMX and CZP were removed consistently (5.3 ± 4.4%, 73.2 ± 21.3% and 4.2 ± 2.3%, respectively), whereas RNT and IBP showed an unsteady removal over time.

The best NaHCO3 concentration (0.2 g L−1) was then used in both photobioreactors. While the fed-batch run performed in the helicoidal photobioreactor provided the best result in terms of biomass productivity, which was (84.8 mg L−1 d−1) about 2.5-fold that of the batch run, the horizontal configuration ensured the highest lipid productivity (10.3 mg L−1 d−1) because of a higher lipid content of biomass (22.8%). These preliminary results suggest that the photobioreactor configuration is a key factor either for the growth or the composition of this microalga. The lipid quality of C. vulgaris biomass grown in both photobioreactors is expected to meet the standards for biodiesel, especially in the case of the helicoidal configuration, provided that further efforts will be made to optimize the conditions for its production as a biodiesel source.",

Subsequently, to improve cell maintenance, a combined feeding strategy of glucose and galactose was proposed focusing on optimizing the ratio of glucose to galactose and feeding time. In addition, the compositions of amino acids and vitamins in feeding medium were refined for balanced supply of nutrients. With the combined feeding strategy, the metabolic shift of lactate from production to consumption occurred, but not accompanied by rapid lactate depletion and ammonium production. Furthermore, energy metabolism was more efficient and better utilization of carbon sources was achieved.

     "abstract": "Bioreactor control has become very important in recent years due to the difficulty in controlling highly non-linear behavior, model mismatch and parameter variation. Adaptive back-stepping control is a recursive design method that employs the Lyapunov stability theory in its design procedures. Adaptive back-stepping control is applied to the problem, which drives a continuous bioreactor to its optimal productivity point. However the designed control law may not work at the optimal productivity point, since controlling the optimal productivity point frequently causes the control system to fall into a singular point. Thus in this study, we apply the back-stepping design to a bioreactor system by introducing a simple parameter into the design techniques to prevent the control system from operating at a singular point. The parameter introduced in the control law can be understood intuitively and the proposed control scheme is endowed with strong robustness properties. The resulting controllers are compared to the feedback linearization based proportional-integral controller and internal model control, as well as nonlinear model predictive control and observer-based linearizing control by theoretical simulations. It is shown that the proposed control strategy is versatile and effective in implementing robust control for regulating productivity in the presence of model mismatch, model uncertainty and parameter variation. The proposed control scheme successfully drives the productivity of the controlled continuous bioreactor to its optimal point.",

     "abstract": "Converting microalgae oil into biodiesel is considered a promising route in the field of biofuel production. However, the cost of microalgae-based biodiesel is still too high to be economically feasible. The high cost of microalgae-based biodiesel is mainly a result of downstream processing, in particular from the extraction of oil out of the microalgal biomass. This study proposes a bacterial (enzymatic) destruction pretreatment of the microalgae cell wall to render the microalgal oil extraction more efficient. It has been found that the cell wall of microalgae can be modified if the microalgal biomass is co-cultured with an indigenous bacterial isolate Flammeovirga yaeyamensis in a salt concentration of 3% and a pH of 8.0. Following this treatment, the activities of some hydrolytic enzymes (i.e., amylase, cellulases, and xylanase) have been detected in the co-culture of F. yaeyamensis and the oil-rich microalga (Chlorella vulgaris ESP-1). The SEM micrographs clearly show specific damage to the microalgae cell wall caused by the bacterial treatment. We found that when the microalgae is pretreated with a concentrated co-culture supernatant (containing the hydrolytic enzymes), a nearly 100% increase in lipid extraction efficiency is obtained. The proposed bacterial disruption method seems to be an effective and environmentally friendly way of improving the efficiency of oil extraction and biofuel production from a microalgal biomass.",

Experiments were conducted using the unbuffered media at mixing frequencies of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 d−1 at 27.5 °C with an initial moisture content of 50%. The results indicate that mixing caused about a tenfold increase in spore production compared to fermentations at static conditions. The cellulase enzyme activity produced was minimally affected by mixing with only a 5–10% decrease in filter paper activity for mechanically mixed fermentations compared to static fermentations. Mixing at lower frequencies of 1, 2, and 3 d−1 caused an increase in CO2 evolution compared to static conditions and higher mixing frequencies of 6 d−1.

The mechanism of overproducing laccase by BSLCc was investigated by metabolism pathway analysis of glucose. The results show glucose limitation in fermentation broth induces the secretion of laccase. The addition of S. cerevisiae, on one hand, leads to an earlier occurrence of glucose limitation state, and thus shortens the fermentation time; on the other hand, it also results in the appearance of a series of metabolites of the yeast including organic acids, ethanol, glycerol and so forth in fermentation broth, and both polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and enzyme activity detection of laccase show that these metabolites contribute to the improvement of laccase activity.",

     "abstract": "The simultaneous oxidation of ammonia, nitrite and toluene using a nitrifying sludge was evaluated and modelled. The experimental data showed that the sole instantaneous inhibition effect due to the presence of toluene was not sufficient to explain the severe decrease in the nitrification activity during the cultures. In addition, prior cell exposure to toluene provoked an important – even complete – inactivation of the nitrifying process. The main contribution was thus to design and integrate an adjustment function in the reaction kinetics to account for the cell inactivation mechanism that occurs during an ongoing culture but is initiated during previous cell exposure to toluene; the use of an adjustment function was a requirement indicated by a previous study using the same nitrifying sludge but in presence of benzene. This inactivation factor varies according to a first-order kinetic model that is time-dependent and enhances the dynamic characteristics of the modelling approach. The model was validated by batch experiments with variable initial toluene concentrations (0 to 20 mg C L−1) and additional inactivation batch assays, where cells were first exposed to 0 to 50 mg of toluene C L−1, washed and then reused in a culture medium without toluene. Changes observed in the ammonium, nitrite, nitrate and toluene concentrations agreed well between the model and experimental data with a single set of kinetic parameters in which confidence intervals and sensitivity were also analysed. The proposed model may be used as a predictive tool to avoid critical conditions for nitrification processes where cells are repeatedly or sequentially exposed to hydrocarbons, such as in a SBR system.",

The present work developed a mathematical model for Trametes versicolor dye decolorization and enzymatic production in a fluidized bed bioreactor operating in batch, repeated batch and continuous mode. The mathematical model considers all of the steps involved in a dye decoloration process, such as the initial dye adsorption on the biomass, intracellular degradation, extracellular degradation, enzyme production and enzyme excretion to the broth. Results obtained from specific experiments at different experimental conditions were used to estimate the kinetic constants. Finally, the whole mathematical model was constructed and validated. Although the variability of the measures, the model predicts the tendency of the experimental results which supports the reliability of the established model and shows that the model can be used to successfully simulate dye decoloration and enzyme production in a fluidized bioreactor.",

In our studies, increase in HA molecular weight was observed by redirecting the carbon flux towards HA biosynthesis pathway by partially inhibiting the glycolytic pathway. Batch bioreactor (1.2 L) studies showed that with the addition of 25 μM sodium iodoacetate, 5 g/L tryptophan and 10 g/L pyruvate, which are glycolytic inhibitors, HA molecular weight increased to 3.2, 3.2 and 3.1 MDa respectively compared to control run (2.4 MDa). Yield coefficients YHA/S and YLA/S showed inverse relationship, indicating competition for glucose between HA and lactic acid formation. Addition of 5 g/L glutamine along with 25 μM sodium iodoacetate also increased the HA concentration to 5.0 g/L from 2.0 g/L in control run. Metabolic flux analysis studies show that concentration and molecular weight of HA is increased by decreasing carbon flux towards glycolysis and PPP and increasing carbon flux towards HA precursor formation. It was observed that specific growth rate of the cells correlated positively to the specific HA production rate and negatively to the molecular weight of HA produced. Addition of antioxidant tannic acid also increased molecular weight to 3.0 MDa.",

When NaDC was incubated with lipase first, lipase was activated at low NaDC concentration (≤CMCNaDC, critical micelle concentration of NaDC). While when NaDC was incubated with the substrate p-nitrophenyl palmitate (p-NPP) first, the activity of lipase was almost completely inhibited, since NaDC adsorbed onto the substrate interface and presented a barrier for lipase approach. The surface tensions of lipase solution declined with the increase of NaDC, which indicated that there was competitive adsorption at the air/solution interface. With increasing concentration of NaDC, the symmetric stretch vibration of CH2 groups at 2853 cm−1, the asymmetric stretch vibration of CH3 groups at 2960 cm−1 and amide I vibration at 1655 cm−1, supposedly caused by lipase amino residues, gradually reduced and eventually disappeared. When NaDC concentration reached high (≥CMCNaDC), the SFG spectra became similar with the pure NaDC spectra, which was direct evidence that NaDC had completely replaced the lipase molecules at the air/solution interface.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this study was kinetic analysis of the multi-enzyme solution produced from waste bread via solid state fermentation by Aspergillus awamori. It was found that at normal temperature for hydrolysis reactions, 60 °C, the activation energies for denaturation of A. awamori glucoamylase, 176.2 kJ/mol, and protease, 149.9 kJ/mol, are much higher than those for catalysis of bread starch, 46.3 kJ/mol, and protein, 36.8 kJ/mol. Kinetic studies showed that glucoamylase and protease in the multi-enzyme solution should have at least two conformations under the two temperature ranges: 30–55 °C and 60–70 °C. Thermodynamic analysis showed that, deactivation of glucoamylase and protease in the multi-enzyme solution can be reversible between 30 °C and 55 °C, since ΔS is negative and ΔH is positive. On the other hand, for glucoamylase and protease, both ΔS and ΔH are positive between 60 °C and 70 °C. This means that the deactivation of both enzymes in the multi-enzyme solution is spontaneous in this temperature range. It was also found that the glucoamylase produced in the solid state fermentation of waste bread is more thermally stable than the protease in the mixture. Consequently, the protease had little or no effect on the stability of the glucoamylase. Furthermore, the half-life of the glucoamylase produced from waste bread pieces was much higher than that produced from wheat flour. This is an important finding because the mode of production, via solid state fermentation, appears to have increased the thermostability of the enzyme significantly.",

In free cell condition, augmentation was not much significant due to competition among the bacterial cells and direct exposure of cells to toxic level of DMF. To enhance the degradation of DMF, cells were entrapped in PVA–alginate matrix individually and collectively for bioaugmentation experiments. Bioaugmentation is successful when immobilized P. denitrificans SD1 is introduced higher inoculum volume with indigenous cultures in continuous packed bed reactor system.

However, there is a lack of understanding regarding the actual reasons for microorganism disruption using ultrasound and whether it is caused by shock or shear. In the case of shear stress, which is the focus of this paper, analysis of the intense turbulent flow region of an in-house built shear apparatus combined with the experimental results demonstrated that when the energy dissipation rate in the turbulence region is high, and the size of the eddy is smaller than the size of the cell, the likelihood of yeast disruption is high. The mechanical properties of yeast cells combined with the calculated energy dissipation rate were used to evaluate the yeast disruption efficiency (log reduction). The results show that the shear apparatus can efficiently and effectively disrupt S. cerevisiae at different treatment times, suspension temperatures and rotor speeds. The experimental work suggests that maximum yeast log reduction was achieved when the maximum power dissipation of 2.095 kW was recorded at 10,000 RPM, while suspension temperature was controlled below 35 °C. The corresponding shear stress at 10,000 RPM was 2586.2 Pa.",

High affinity octamer peptides, NKFRGKYK and NARKFYKG, for mouse IgG were obtained by amino acid substitution assays. Both peptides also recognized human IgG-Fc. The association constants for human IgG-Fc were 8.9 × 106 (NKFRGKYK) and 6.5 × 106 M−1 (NARKFYKG). Purity of the human IgG-Fc from cell culture medium using the peptide immobilized resins was 83% for NKFRGKYK and 68% for NARKFYKG.

The inactivation histories of Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris were investigated at air temperatures of 70, 90, and 110 °C. It was found that the viability of L. cremoris cells could be maintained at approximately the original level for extended drying durations (60–210 s), despite the high air temperatures. When plotted against droplet temperature Td, the inactivation rate kd at six drying conditions formed a general trend. An inactivation model was proposed to describe different inactivation histories under varied drying conditions. The description closely followed the experimental data, reported for the first time in literature. kd increased rapidly after Td passed a transition temperature range of 50–65 °C, coinciding with the onset temperature for denaturation of bacterial ribosomes.

Although inactivation of pyruvate formate-lyase and lactate dehydrogenase is found to enhance the PPC pathway for succinic acid production, it results in excessive pyruvic acid accumulation and limits regeneration of NAD+ from NADH formed in glycolysis. In other organisms, oxaloacetate is synthesized by carboxylation of pyruvic acid by pyruvate carboxylase (PYC) during glucose metabolism, and in E. coli, nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRTase) is a rate-limiting enzyme of the NAD(H) synthesis system.

Herein, the counteraction of trehalose on urea-induced unfolding of ferricytochrome c was studied. Thermodynamic parameters for the counteraction of trehalose were derived based on fluorescence spectroscopic data. Then the kinetics was emphatically investigated by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. Urea-induced unfolding of ferricytochrome c in 8.00 mol/L urea solution reveals two observable phases, including fast and slow phases following a burst phase. Trehalose has little influence on the burst phase amplitude. Nevertheless, the observable unfolding pathway is significantly affected by trehalose. At lower trehalose concentrations (<0.20 mol/L) in 8.00 mol/L urea, the unfolding pathways still keep to show two phases. However, the rate constant and amplitude for the fast phase diminish with increasing trehalose concentration. In contrast, the rate constant for the slow phase shows only a slight change with a significant increase of the amplitude. At higher trehalose concentrations (>0.30 mol/L), the unfolding pathway is transformed into a single slow phase. The rate constant and amplitude for the single phase also decrease with increasing trehalose concentration. The studies are expected to help our understanding of trehalose effects on protein stability.",

     "abstract": "High quality, intact messenger RNA (mRNA) is required for DNA microarray and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis and is generally obtained from total RNA isolations. The most widely recognized measure of RNA integrity is the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) obtained from the Agilent Bioanalyzer, as it provides sizing, quantification, and quality control measures. This work describes comparisons of the RIN values obtained for recombinant Escherichia coli. Uninduced recombinant E. coli cultures were examined, as well as induced cultures that produced either a soluble or insoluble recombinant protein. The uninduced cultures and the induced cultures producing soluble protein had higher RIN values than the induced cultures producing insoluble protein. These lower RIN values for E. coli producing the insoluble protein indicate that cellular degradation of the ribosomal RNA species is the likely cause of the lower RIN values. As the use of DNA microarrays and other gene expression tools increase in usage in the industrial recombinant protein production community, these results suggest the need for further studies to determine acceptable RIN ranges for gene expression analysis and effects of various culture conditions on RIN values for recombinant E. coli.",

Insoluble substrate and immobilized enzyme were biased to bottom phase, while the product was partitioned to top phase. Microcrystalline cellulose was hydrolyzed into reducing sugar, and the product entered into top phase. The yield of saccharification in ATPS could reach 70.57% at the initial substrate concentration of 0.5% (w/v), and the value was 9.3% higher than that in the single aqueous phase.

Sodium deoxycholate (SDC) was selected as an adsorption promoter to improve the BR adsorption capacity of a cellulose acetate (CA)/polyethyleneimine (PEI) membrane. Static adsorption experiments show that the maximum BR adsorption capacity of the membrane with SDC in BR–HA mock solution is 100–200% at the molar ratio of SDC to HA ranging from 8 to 12, higher than that without SDC. It is also found that SDC is more efficiently adsorbed by the membrane than BR and HA. Absorption, circular dichroism, and zeta potential studies demonstrate that SDC can be bound with the BR–HA complex to form a ternary BR–HA-SDCm complex. On the basis, the facilitated adsorption mechanism of BR with SDC was proposed that SDC aggregates or micelles form a quasi-multilayer adsorption on the membrane, increase approachable binding sites, and prolong the distance between the BR–HA complex and the membrane. Thus, SDC as a spacer reduces the influence of the steric hindrance of HA, resulting in an enhanced BR adsorption capacity. Dynamic adsorption results further evidence the facilitated adsorption mechanism.",

     "abstract": "Two acclimatized biomasses exposed to ammonium (NH4+) concentration of 600 mg N L−1, one from a completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR), the other from a sequencing batch reactor (SBR), were assayed for nitritation performance, predominant nitrifying bacterial population and nitrous oxide (N2O) production. By virtue of fluctuating and constant NH4+ concentrations respectively, the SBR and CSTR wastewater supply regimes were hypothesized to support different predominant ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) exhibiting distinct biokinetic properties. Nitritation efficiency (NO2−-N/NO2+3−-N) was higher in the SBR (89%) than the CSTR (30%) likely due to free ammonia and dissolved oxygen concentration. Quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses revealed that fast-growing (r-strategist) AOB of halophilic and halotolerant Nitrosomonas lineage were more highly enriched in the SBR (76 ± 4.2%) than the CSTR (38 ± 6.0%). The CSTR predominantly enriched slow-growing (K-strategist) AOB Nitrosospira spp. (42 ± 1.9% versus 1.4 ± 0.8% in the SBR). Biokinetic parameter estimation consolidated the FISH result: the maximum growth rate and half-saturation coefficients for NH4+ were higher in the SBR (μmax = 0.92 day, KNH4+ = 28.9 mg N L−1) relative to the CSTR (μmax = 0.42 day, KNH4+ = 3.47 mg N L−1), suggesting that the extent of nitritation may be controlled by choice of wastewater influent operational regime, which itself determines predominant AOB. N2O production was a maximum of 25 times higher (10.2 mg N-N2O h−1 at 0.5 mg O2 L−1) in CSTR-enriched biomass than in SBR-enriched biomass (0.41 mg N-N2O h−1 at 0.5 mg O2 L−1).",

     "abstract": "Efficient inducible mammalian expression systems are becoming increasingly available and are particularly attractive from a process optimization point of view in that they allow decoupling the growth and production phases. In biphasic processes, the timing of induction is one of the most critical factors to consider for maximizing the productivity, since it will affect both the cumulative biomass concentration and the cell specific productivity. In an effort to assess how these two factors must be balanced for optimal productivity, we have performed a metabolic characterization of CHO cells expressing a recombinant antibody and harboring an efficient inducible expression system. Cells taken at different stages of growth were transferred and induced in fresh medium at their corresponding cell densities, and the kinetics of growth, nutrient consumption and product formation were compared during the production phase. Low cell density inductions achieved lower maximum cell concentrations, but exhibited higher cell specific productivity and greater culture longevity, and ultimately led to increased final product titers. To gain more physiological insights into the observed differences, 13C metabolic flux analysis was performed to characterize and compare the metabolism of cells induced at respectively low and high cell concentrations. A number of key intracellular fluxes were found to be affected by the cell density and the corresponding availability of nutrients during the induction phase. While glucose utilization efficiency is increased in high cell density induction, thereby reducing the specific lactate production rate, it appears to be compensating for the decreased catabolic rates of amino acids. The comprehensive metabolic characterization performed in this work can help guide the development of an efficient feeding strategy pre- and post-induction.",

During batch phase, by-products were detected when glucose was used, despite maintaining DO at values higher than 35%. Also, the presence of cell aggregates was detected affecting the reproducibility and operability of the bioprocess.Conversely, glucose was the best substrate for fed-batch phase. When working at C-limiting conditions, neither by-products nor aggregates were detected and Fab production levels were comparable to those obtained with glycerol. In addition, the lower heat yield (YQ/X) and oxygen to biomass yield ( Y O 2 / X ) for glucose-supported cultures made this substrate the best alternative from an industrial operational point of view.In addition, the effect of specific growth rate on fed-batch Fab production was studied.

Directed evolution towards improved acylation activity requires a high-throughput screening method. The aim of this study is to explore whether the acylation activity of BioH can be improved by directed evolution of its hydrolysis activity. A colorimetric method based on p-nitrophenyl butyrate hydrolysis was adopted in the high-throughput determination of hydrolysis activity. The wild-type BioH showed a hydrolysis activity of 18 U/mg, and the specific activities for α-phenylethanol and α-phenylethylamine acylation were 12.8 U/mg and 3.5 U/mg, respectively. After two rounds of directed evolution, seven mutants with improved hydrolysis activity were obtained, among which, K213E, Q70L/M170T and M197L/K213E also showed improvement in acylation activity. To further improve the acylation activity, site mutations were generated in different combinations at the four hot spots Q70L, M170T, M197L and K213E. Among the resulting mutants, Q70L/M197L/K213E showed the highest activity in α-phenylethylamine acylation with a 120% improvement, while Q70L/K213E had the highest α-phenylethanol acylation activity, which was improved by 70%.

In this work, a novel open fungal reactor system with ozone as the bactericide, and using immobilized Phanerochaete chrysosporium, was built and operated continuously to produce the manganese peroxidase and decolorize the Acid Blue 45. The results showed that an average of 84% Acid Blue 45 decolorization, the manganese peroxidase production with its activity ranging from 63 U L−1 to 5 U L−1, was achieved during about 25 days system continuous operation.

     "abstract": "The rapid development of anaerobic digestion brought with it the problem of biomass resources and supply. Marine biomass is emerging as an advantageous substrate. Such macroalgae as Palmaria palmata are promising substrates for anaerobic digestion as they possess a high methane potential (308 ± 9 mL gVS−1). The aim of this paper was to study the efficiency of the anaerobic digestion of P. palmata after a range of thermal and chemical pretreatment. The anaerobic digestion of raw and pretreated macroalgae was carried out in batch mesophilic biomethane potential tests (BMP). Thermal (between 20 and 200 °C) and thermo-chemical (addition of NaOH and HCl) pretreatment were performed on P. palmata. Thermal pretreatments at 20, 70, 85 and 120 °C and acid or soda pretreatments at 160 °C had no significant effect on P. palmata's methane potential. After high temperature pretreatment (180–200 °C), the BMP decreased with the temperature which can be explained by the formation of refractory compounds in the liquid fraction. In contrast, the addition of 0.04 gNaOH gTS−1 at 20 °C led to a release of proteins and induced an increase in the BMP from 308 ± 9 mL gVS−1 (untreated) to 365 ± 9 mL gVS−1. Thus, P. palmata can be used advantageously as a substrate for anaerobic digestion and its methane production enhanced by the addition of NaOH.",

     "abstract": "Novel methods are needed for the development of nanodispersed drug formulations to enhance bioavailability of many hydrophobic pharmaceuticals. The poorly water-soluble quinine is a well-known anti-malaria drug which can be used as a promising model compound for the development of novel nanodispersed formulations. In addition to hydrophobic drug's own affecting properties, surfactants play an important role for the enhancement of their low bioavailability by preparing stable dispersions. Amphiphilic compounds can efficiently be used to stabilize colloidal fragments by preventing the precipitation or crystallization of poorly water-soluble active ingredients during fabrication. A novel biopolymer derivative based on the biotechnologically produced γ-polyglutamic acid (γ-PGA) from Bacillus licheniformis cultivation was developed for encapsulation of the active ingredient. High-molecular γ-PGA is an anionic polyelectrolyte that was optimized and modified with hydrophobic l-phenylalanine ethyl ester (l-PAE) to form an amphiphilic comb polymer P(γ-GA-r-l-PAE) with surfactive properties. The approach of the nanodispersion polymer concentration, molecular weight and grafting degree enables the efficient stabilization of the poorly water-soluble model drug. The research presented in this report indicates the potential benefits of hydrophobically modified γ-PGA and suggests its potential role in forming stable dispersions for future pharmaceutical applications.",

Scanning electron microscopy revealed white deposits of TOPO impregnated non-uniformly within the cross sections and surfaces of the membranes. The extractant impregnated membranes exhibited high adsorption capacity and rates, whereas biodegradation of 800–2500 mg/L phenol at 200 mL volume in the extractant impregnated hollow fiber membrane bioreactor (EIHFMB) was characterized by high cell growth and biodegradation rates. For example, 1000 mg/L phenol was completely degraded within 12 h at a specific growth rate of 0.73 h−1 while the biomass yield and average biodegradation rate were 0.31 g/g and 86 mg/L h, respectively. The biodegradation capacity and rate in the EIHFMB were improved by increasing the effective length of the fibers by 50%, as demonstrated during the biodegradation of 3000 mg/L phenol. The adsorption/desorption rates were also enhanced with increasing aqueous phase flow rate. EIHFMB performance remained unchanged over 400 h of operation under various operating conditions suggesting the stability of TOPO impregnation within the membrane. These results indicate the use of EIHFMB as a promising technology in solvent-free two-phase biodegradation of phenolic compounds.",

Since carbohydrates in microalgae biomass are mainly cellulose in the cell wall and starch in the plastids without lignin and low hemicelluloses contents, they can be readily converted into fermentable sugars. However, to date there are very few studies focusing on the use of microalgae-based carbohydrates for biofuel production, which requires more understanding and knowledge to support the technical feasibility of this next-generation feedstock. This review article elucidates comprehensive information on the characteristics and metabolism of main fermentable microalgal carbohydrates (e.g., starch and cellulose), as well as the key factors and challenges that should be addressed during production and saccharification of microalgal carbohydrates. Furthermore, developments on the utilization of microalgae-based feedstock in producing liquid and gaseous biofuels are summarized. The objective of this article is to provide useful knowledge and information with regard to biochemistry, bioprocess engineering, and commercial applications to assist in the viable technology development of for biofuels generation from microalgae-based carbohydrates.",

The dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) contents increased when alkanolamine compounds existed in the medium. Utilizing the increased DIC for algal uptake, TEA exhibited a best enhancement in CO2 fixation performance compared to other absorbents, while primary ethanolamines displayed inhibition on cell growth due to the formation of relatively stable carbamate intermediate. By adding 5 mM TEA, the cell growth and CO2 fixation rate increased by 30.5% compared to the case with no TEA. TEA was supplemented when cell density was doubled, tripled and quadrupled to maintain the TEA to cells ratio constant pacing the increase of cell density.

The results demonstrate that the performance of PMFCs increased in terms of maximum power density and exchange current density (io) with the tendency of decreasing in internal resistance (Rint) and over potential (η) values as increasing monochromatic blue and red LED light intensities.

The structural characterization of purified MEL revealed the hydrophobic structure of MEL-C consisting of short chain fatty acid (C2 or C4) at the C-2′ position and a long chain fatty acid (C14, C16 or C18) at the C-3′ position of the mannose moiety. The MEL-C showed good surface activity with critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 4.5 × 10−6 M and surface tension of 33 mN/m at CMC. The crude biosurfactants were stable at high temperature and over the alkaline pH range which favour their scope of application as laundry detergent additives.

Starch and peptone were identified as the optimized carbon and nitrogen sources for the production of prodigiosin, yielding a prodigiosin concentration of 2.3 g/L. This value was significantly increased to 6.7 g/L using a carbon/nitrogen ratio of 6/4 (starch/peptone = 16 g/L/10.67 g/L). To enhance prodigiosin production even further, a statistical experimental design methodology was utilized to optimize the composition of the culture medium that is utilized in the production of prodigiosin.

In this study, we used lactic acid bacteria to produce cyanophycin by nisin-controlled gene expression system (NICE). The cyanophycin synthetase gene cphA of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 was cloned to the vector pNZ8149 followed by transformation into Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris NZ3900. The effects of nisin concentrations and the amounts of supplemented aspartic acid and arginine were examined for the production of cyanophycin. Alterations of the terminus of cphA gene were also conducted in an attempt to increase the yield of cyanophycin. An optimal cyanophycin production was noted under a culture condition of log phase induced at 250 ng/mL nisin in M17L medium supplemented with 20 mM arginine and 10 mM aspartic acid. An insertion of glycine residue at the C terminus of cyanophycin synthetase resulted in a yield of 20% of dry cell weight, a 10-fold increase when compared with the wild type. The results showed that recombinant lactic acid bacteria, a GRAS system, could provide an alternative approach of producing cyanophycin suitable for agricultural and biomedical applications.",

At stationary phase, cells of strain EJ01 aggregated and formed biofilm when concentrations of Cd was high (2 mM and above). This phenomenon might be related to the bacterium's ability to produce exopolysaccharides (EPS). Strain EJ01 also showed resistance to other toxic heavy metals examined. Concentrations of heavy metal was reduced significantly when Pseudomonas sp. EJ01 grown in the medium containing these toxic metal ions. Biofilm formation and EPS production were important for the bacterium's resistance against heavy metals. Exopolysaccharide was produced by strain EJ01 and 50% more EPS was produced when the cells grown in the medium containing 2 mM CdCl2 compared to those grown on the medium without heavy metals. A biofilm defective mutant (strain m-3055) was obtained by transposon mutagenesis.

In this study, the surface modifications of bacterial cellulose (BC) membranes were facilitated using either simple coating or chemical grafting methods. The surface coating method is to simply immobilize BC membranes with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) solutions of concentration from 1 to 10%, followed by post-treatment with argon (Ar) plasma. The chemical method involved grafting mPEG (monofunctional methyl ether PEG) on BCs. The outcomes of surface modifications were characterized by surface chemical compositions (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), and surface morphology (atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)). The effects of resistance to biofouling were verified by quantifying the adsorption of proteins and mammalian cells. The results showed that the PEG coating on BCs improved the resistance to cell adhesion by more than 30%. On the other hand, the specific chemical grafting resulted in a particularly high resistance to biofouling that the density of adherent cells reduced by more than 70% when compared to that on pristine BC. We have demonstrated that the two proposed methods were effective for the preparation of bioinert BC membranes with great potentials for applications in biomaterials and tissue engineering.",

To fabricate a glutamate sensor in the array, glutamate oxidase is selectively immobilized on a microelectrode site which is closely arrayed to other microelectrodes (platinum microelectrodes with ∼100 μm separation) with the electrode dimension of ∼30 μm × 140 μm by adsorbing the enzyme on the electrodeposited chitosan matrix on the electrode surface.

The 51-residue polypeptide hormone insulin, which is associated with type II diabetes, has been demonstrated to fibrillate in vitro. With bovine insulin as a model, the research presented here examines the influence of two simple, unstructured d,l-lysine-co-glycine (d,l-lys-co-gly) and d,l-lysine-co-L-phenylalanine (d,l-lys-co-phe) copolypeptides, on the in vitro fibril formation process of bovine insulin at pH 2.0 and 55 °C. Our results showed that amyloid fibrillogenesis of insulin may be suppressed by both copolypeptides in a concentration-dependent fashion. In addition, the copolypeptides with higher molar fractions of glycine or l-phenylalanine residue, which are considered to possess higher hydrophobic interacting capacities, demonstrated the superior inhibitory potency against insulin fibril formation. Our findings suggest that the association of insulin and copolypeptides, which is likely dominated by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, may mitigate the extent of insulin fibrillogenesis.

Three segmented block copolymers, Hytrel® 8206, Hytrel® 3078, and Pebax® 2533, containing varying types and amounts of soft segment components, exhibited different affinity toward the product and by-product. The polymers were each used as the sequestering phase for metabolite removal from this transformation in a two-phase partitioning bioreactor (TPPB). The polymer with the highest affinity for each metabolite enhanced its production via more extensive partitioning into the polymer phase. This work reports the first use of polymers whose differing compositions are attributed to target molecule affinity and the different production profiles seen during two-phase biocatalysis. The uniquely high water content of 30 wt% in Hytrel® 8206 emphasized the importance of accounting for water uptake in partition calculations, and potentially conferred enhanced affinity and diffusivity by providing an expanded polymer network, significantly improving biotransformation completion time compared to the low-water-absorbing polymers.",

At low urea concentration (0.8 M), the AC could enhance the refolding yield of RNase A by effectively suppressing its intermolecular interaction-induced aggregation. As a result, 0.9 mg/mL RNase A could be 77% refolded, which was a 57% increase as compared to that without the AC. At high protein concentration range (0.9–2.3 mg/mL in total protein concentrations) and 1.6 M urea, CTAB selectively precipitated contaminant proteins distinctly, so a purification effect was achieved. For example, 1.5 mg/mL RNase A could be 62% refolded and recovered at a purity of 87%, which was a 34% increase in purity as compared to that in IBs (65%). The precipitation selectivity was considered due to the differences in the hydrophobicity of the proteins. The work indicates that by using the AC, RNase A could be efficiently refolded at low urea concentration and purified at high urea concentration from IBs at high protein concentrations.",

An obviously positive effect was observed after introduction of ultrasound into the BDS system. The sulfur content of bunker oil did not decrease in absence of ultrasound pre-treatment. After ultrasonic pre-treatment, about 10–20% of sulfur was removed for the samples without any additive and was dependent on ultrasonic irradiation time, ultrasonic wave amplitude, biocatalyst initial concentration and ratio of oil phases to aqueous phases.

The main taxoid metabolites (paclitaxel, baccatin III, taxol C, etc.) in Taxus cell culture showed great difference under shear stress. However, the regulating mechanism of taxoids metabolism under shear stress remained elusive. Here an efficient metabolic profiling approach combined with multivariate analysis was employed to profile taxoids changes of Taxus cells under laminar shear stress. A total of 21 taxoids were identified and quantified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q-TOF mass spectrometry. The result showed the contents of paclitaxel and baccatin III were reduced by shear stress, indicating the inhibitory effect of shear stress on paclitaxel biosynthesis. The levels of other taxoids uninvolved in paclitaxel biosynthesis were decreased except several metabolites. Further analysis of mapping measured taxoids concentrations onto paclitaxel biosynthesis pathway illustrating proposed intermediates and “off-pathway” metabolites revealed shear stress might disrupt the appropriate cyclization process of geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, aggravate the inappropriate order of hydroxylations and acylations, and not be good for functional group oxetane formation. These findings revealed the possible mechanism for shear stress limiting paclitaxel production and might have important biotechnological applications to increase the yields of paclitaxel and relevant precursors.",

Although they have many advantages, the biggest drawback and limitation of oxidoreductase usage is the price of the coenzymes.

Unfortunately, although results indicate that those methods are suitable for regeneration procedure, most of the processes need additional optimization to make them more sustainable. As an alternative, microreactor technology could be used as a new technique for coenzyme regeneration processes due to many advantages.In this study regeneration of coenzyme NAD+ was carried out in a microreactor by acetaldehyde reduction to ethanol using enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Suspended and immobilized whole permeabilized baker’s yeast cells were used as the source of the ADH enzyme. A 65.3% conversion of NADH was achieved with suspended permeabilized baker’s yeast cells for a residence time of τ = 36 s and equimolar concentration of substrates (ci,NADH = 5.5 mmol/dm3, ci,acetaldehyde = 5.5 mmol/dm3). When working with immobilized cells, conversion achieved for the same residence time was 10 fold lower.

BCA has an asymmetric structure, with a thin, dense outer layer covering an interior of interconnected macropores that are distributed throughout the sponge, which is effective for yeast immobilization. At 48 h of the fermentation, the maximum ethanol concentration produced by the immobilized culture (IC) in the BCA carrier was about 100 g/L, which was approximately 13% and 45% higher than that from the suspended culture (SC) and from IC in Ca-alginate matrix, respectively. Repeated-batch ethanol productions using IC in BCA carriers were also more stable than those using SC or IC in Ca-alginate matrix. The results of a 15 cycle repeated batch operation demonstrated that the system with IC in BCA exhibited superior long-term stability for ethanol fermentation with the average ethanol productivity at 1.9 g/L h and the immobilized yield at 86%. The improved ethanol fermentation performance was mainly due to the water uptake ability and properly interconnected pore structure, which help to overcome limiting mass transfer.",

A novel metabolic model incorporating directed signal flow diagram and enzymatic activities data was proposed to interpret the yield enhancement. The simulation and experimental results revealed that singly regulating each individual enzyme could not increase the yield, and glutamate yield could be enhanced only when six key enzymes of pyruvate carboxylase (PC), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), isocitrate lyase (ICL), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and α-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (ODHC) works in a coordinated way. Namely, relative activities ratios of enzymatic pairs of PC/PDH should be controlled at moderate level of 6:4, while those of ICDH/ICL and GDH/ODHC at higher level of 8:2 simultaneously.

The results showed that the A/EI-SBR removed 1.32 ± 0.03–3.55 ± 0.04 mg of phosphorus per g of volatile suspended solids during the steady-state operation, suggesting that BPR from domestic wastewater could be well realised in the A/EI regime. Then, another SBR operated as the conventional anaerobic/oxic (A/O) regime was conducted to compare the soluble orthophosphate (SOP) removal with the A/EI regime. The results clearly showed that the A/EI regime achieved higher SOP removal than the A/O regime. Finally, the mechanism for the A/EI-SBR driving superior SOP removal was investigated. It was found that the sludge cultured by the A/EI regime had more polyphosphate accumulating organisms and less glycogen accumulating organisms than that by the A/O regime. Further investigations showed that the A/EI-SBR had a lower glycogen transformation and a higher PHB/PHV ratio, which correlated well with the superior phosphorus removal.",

Compared with the free cells and the beads without CNTs, the AL/CNT/cell beads showed up to 4 times higher reduction rates, mainly attributed to an enhanced electron transfer by the CNTs. In addition, the dose of CNTs greatly improved the stability of beads, suggesting a high feasibility of the AL/CNT/cell beads for repeated use.

Because of high shearing force and frictional heating during the pelleting process, it is hypothesized that pelleting of lignocellulosic biomass could also partially deconstruct its complex structure and facilitate bioethanol production. In this study, pelleted wheat straw, corn stover, big bluestem, and sorghum stalk were evaluated for sugars and ethanol production, and compared with those of unpelleted biomasses. Mass recovery after alkali pretreatment increased by 14%, 11%, 2%, and 5%, respectively, in unpelleted biomasses. Lignin content reduced significantly more in pelleted samples for all types of biomass, except sorghum stalk. Volumetric productivity of enzymatic hydrolysis was 23%, 21%, 20% and 12% higher, respectively, in pelleted samples; ethanol yield on the basis of released sugars did not differ significantly between pelleted and unpelleted samples. These results indicate that the pelleting process led to better enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated biomasses without affecting the quality of sugars for fermentation. However, overall yield of ethanol from the raw biomass was not significantly higher in pelleted biomasses because of higher mass loss during pretreatment process. In our study, we propose a schematic for complete utilization of various byproducts for enhanced economic viability.",

Based on experience in practice it was hypothesized that nitrification could be maintained at far lower SRT's than in conventional activated sludge systems and with high organic loading rates applied. A field gathering campaign has been carried out on a hybrid activated sludge/biofilm. The obtained results highlighted that the pilot plant was capable to remove the organic matter at loading rates up to 3.00 kg TCOD m−3 day−1, also showing very high nitrification activity. Ammonia uptake rate (AUR) batch test showed that biofilm nitrification activity increased when the mixed liquor SRT decreased. The final suggestion is that it is possible to run a hybrid reactor with low mixed liquor SRT values, as well as low temperatures, still having a high ammonium removal efficiency, since a large fraction of nitrification activity will take place in the biofilm.",

Crude enzyme solutions containing mainly exo- and endoamylases, proteases, xylanases, and cellulases were produced under standardized procedures by means of SSF of babassu cake by Aspergillus awamori IOC-3914. Central composite designs were implemented and revealed optimal activities of the enzymes produced between pH 4.4–5.0 and 45–51 °C. Based on the application of a global desirability analysis on all the group of enzymes detected in the multienzyme solution, an overall optimal activity was observed at 53 °C and pH 4.7. These conditions were used for the separate hydrolysis of babassu cake and babassu flour, in order to evaluate the ability to simultaneously hydrolyze crude starch, cellulose, hemicelluloses, and protein.

     "abstract": "The use of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and their progeny in high throughput drug discovery and regenerative medicine will require production at scale of well characterized cells at an appropriate level of purity. The adoption of automated bioprocessing techniques offers the possibility to overcome the lack of consistency and high failure rates seen with current manual protocols. To build the case for increased use of automation this work addresses the key question: “can an automated system match the quality of a highly skilled and experienced person working manually?” To answer this we first describe an integrated automation platform designed for the ‘hands-free’ culture and differentiation of ESCs in microwell formats. Next we outline a framework for the systematic investigation and optimization of key bioprocess variables for the rapid establishment of validatable Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Finally the experimental comparison between manual and automated bioprocessing is exemplified by expansion of the murine Oct-4-GiP ESC line over eight sequential passages with their subsequent directed differentiation into neural precursors. Our results show that ESCs can be effectively maintained and differentiated in a highly reproducible manner by the automated system described. Statistical analysis of the results for cell growth over single and multiple passages shows up to a 3-fold improvement in the consistency of cell growth kinetics with automated passaging. The quality of the cells produced was evaluated using a panel of biological markers including cell growth rate and viability, nutrient and metabolite profiles, changes in gene expression and immunocytochemistry. Automated processing of the ESCs had no measurable negative effect on either their pluripotency or their ability to differentiate into the three embryonic germ layers. Equally important is that over a 6-month period of culture without antibiotics in the medium, we have not had any cases of culture contamination. This study thus confirms the benefits of adopting automated bioprocess routes to produce cells for therapy and for use in basic discovery research.",

For example, the flow regime in the ambr™ vessel is transitional rather than turbulent and the sparged air/oxygen superficial gas velocity is relatively very low whilst the specific power input is much higher (~400 W/m3) when compared to that used at larger scales (typically ~20 W/m3). This specific power input is necessary in order to achieve kLa values sufficiently high to satisfy the oxygen demand of the cells and control of dO2. In line with other studies, we find that the culture of CHO cells in a 15 mL ambr™ bioreactor gave similar cell growth and productivity to that achieved in a 5 L stirred bioreactor whilst the results from shake flasks were significantly different.

Also sequential ultrafiltration revealed the enrichment of these protein concentrates in peptides with high angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity. Thereby, UF-fractionation followed by proteolysis of protein concentrates from cuttlefish wastewaters offers new opportunities for the development of bioactive hydrolysates with application in the food industry. In addition, this approach contributes to an improved depuration of industrial wastewaters, reducing the treatment costs and leading to a decrease in its contaminating effect.",

The microbial conversion of HAc to FAs was achieved with ~20% of the theoretical yield. We cultured the engineered strain with HAc-rich liquid wastes, which yielded ~0.43 g/L FAs using waste streams from dilute acid hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass and ~0.17 g/L FAs using effluent from anaerobic-digested sewage sludge. 13C-isotopic experiments showed that the metabolism in our engineered strain had high carbon fluxes toward FAs synthesis and TCA cycle in a complex HAc medium.

Gas–liquid mass transfer in a three-phase inverse fluidized bed reactor designed for biosurfactant production by Bacillus subtilis was studied. The influence of main parameters on kLa was investigated in model and real fermentation conditions. Oxygen transfer increased up to 175% and up to 24% with the increase of superficial gas and liquid velocities, respectively. The oxygen transfer obtained in the TPIFB bioreactor (kLa up to 0.015 s−1) was higher than in the other bioreactors used for biosurfactant production. A significant decrease of kLa (up to 27%) was measured during fermentation process. It was shown that this decrease of kLa was a result of surface tension decrease due to the production of biosurfactants. However the oxygen transfer remained important and allowed a correct oxygen supply for the aerobic B. subtilis strains. A correlation based on dimensional analysis was proposed to estimate kLa in function of the influencing parameters, integrating surface tension effects. This correlation allowed estimating correctly kLa in the presence or not of solid particles. The correlation being based on dimensionless numbers, it could help for further process control and scale-up considerations.",

Three homogenous catalysts (sulphuric acid, sodium hydroxide and sodium methoxide), and one heterogeneous catalyst (molecular sieve A) were used in microalgae dried at 0%, 1.5%, and 10% moisture. Maximum lipid conversion was obtained for both, marine and freshwater dried microalgae using sulphuric acid as catalyst. A FAME yield of 73 ± 5% was achieved from N. oculata at a catalyst:lipid molar ratio of 0.8:1; while 92 ± 2% was obtained from Chlorella sp. at a catalyst:lipid molar ratio of 0.35:1. Differences in FAME yield among microalgae were analysed in terms of overall cell structure and biomass salinity. It was observed that cells of N. oculata were not as easily disrupted as those of Chlorella sp. and that salts present in N. oculata biomass did not affect the acidic transesterification reaction. In conclusion, the acidic in situ transesterification of dried marine or freshwater microalgae produced the highest conversion; however the yield of alkyl esters was potentially affected by the microalgae cell structure and not the salinity of the biomass.",

Surface roughness of conditioning film coated slides was evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and its effect on the bacterial initial adhesion was not significant. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were performed to determine the elemental surface compositions of bacterial cells and substrates. Results showed that bacterial adhesion to bare slides and slides coated with alginate and humic substances increased as ionic strength increased. Conversely, BSA coating enhanced bacterial adhesion at low ionic strength but hindered adhesion at higher ionic strength. It was concluded that forces other than hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions were involved in controlling bacterial adhesion to BSA coated surfaces. A steric model for polymer brushes that considers the combined influence of steric effects and DLVO interaction forces was shown to adequately describe the observed bacterial adhesion behaviors.",

However, lab-scale studies in order to establish a specific limit value of IA/PA referred to SS-OFMSW had not been conducted. In this study, a reference reactor (R1) was operated at low organic loading rates (OLR) and high hydraulic retention times (HRT) during 165 days. Besides, severe disturbances were applied to a second reactor (R2) during 281 days by means of increasing both HRT and OLR in order to assess the digester response under continuous overload conditions. The obtained results show that an IA/PA ratio of below 0.3 is recommended to maintain total VFAs between 2.5 and 3.5 kg m−3 and achieve a stable reactor performance treating SS-OFMSW in a range of total alkalinity (TA) between 13 and 15 kg CaCO3 m−3.

Despite distinct advantages of algal biofuels, however, their sustainability and economic viability is still doubtful. Overall process cost and low energy recovery need to be significantly improved. The use of MAB, after extracting primary fuels in the form of hydrogen, methane, biodiesel and bioethanol, can be one promising route. This algal biomass, collectively termed as spent microalgal biomass (SMAB), contains even up to 70% of its initial energy level and also retains nutrients including proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Potential application routes include diet for animals and fish, the removal of heavy metals and dyes from wastewater, and the production of bioenergy (e.g., biofuels and electricity). Unlike whole algae biomass whose applications are relatively well documented, SMAB has been studied only to limited degree. Therefore, this work gives a brief overview of various ways of SMAB applications. An insight into current status, barriers and future prospects on SMAB research is provided. The feasibility of each application is evaluated on the basis of its energy recovery, economic viability, and future perspectives are provided.",

Pretreatments of secondary sludge have shown important advantages in the elimination of volatile solids and pathogenic microorganisms from the sludge, and they have also had a positive effect on biogas production. However, such methods are associated with high operating costs. This paper shows the behavior of a autohydrolysis pretreatment, which consists of subjecting the secondary sludge to a temperature of 55 °C for 12–24 h with a limited amount of oxygen under batch operation. The pretreatment results in a high solubilization of organic matter, increasing the fluidity of the sludge and improving the biogas production. This study focuses on the evaluation of the influence of oxygen and the initial sludge concentration on the pretreatment behavior. The main results obtained showed that when autohydrolysis pretreatment was carried out for 12 h, with a high solid concentration and microaerobic conditions, the solubilization of organic matter was increased by 40%, the methane productivity was improved by 23%, and there was an overall improvement in sludge fluidity. Moreover, the energy assessment of the autohydrolysis pretreatment and anaerobic digestion system showed the energetic feasibility of this treatment method, since the increase in energy production compensates for the extra energy required to carry out the pretreatment.",

Cells inoculated within microfibrous carriers in a 125-mL bioreactor were studied at two different agitation speeds, 60 rpm and 90 rpm. Agitation at 60 rpm supported faster and more uniform cell seeding, and led to a higher cell expansion fold compared to agitation at 90 rpm. For integrated expansion and neural differentiation, cells in the microfibrous carriers were cultured in the expansion medium for 4 days and then in the astrocyte-conditioned medium to induce neural differentiation for 10 days. In this integrated process, mESCs were expanded 22-fold with 60–67% of cells exhibiting neural markers (i.e., nestin, neurofilament) as analyzed by flow cytometry. The neural differentiation was further verified with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which showed up-regulation of neural genes nestin, Nurr1, and NF-68 (a light chain of neurofilament), and down-regulation of pluripotent genes Oct-4, Rex-1 and Nanog.

Using ionic complexation between the positively charged DOX and the negatively charged polyelectrolyte γ-PGA, DOX:γ-PGA complexes were produced with an efficiency of approximately 99%. SEM micrographs demonstrated that the complexation of γ-PGA and DOX alone does not lead to the formation of nanoparticles and that the addition of a third component, chitosan, is required. Drug-loaded DOX:γ-PGA:CS nanoparticles were produced with particle sizes ranging from ~150 to ~630 nm. The stability of the DOX:γ-PGA:CS nanoparticles was examined by suspending the nanoparticles in different kinds of aqueous media. For the first time, in vitro studies with DOX-loaded nanoparticles demonstrated the cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles against a human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line (HN-5a). Non-drug-loaded γ-PGA:CS nanoparticles did not display cytotoxic effects. It was shown that the encapsulated or surface-bound DOX did not lose its bioactivity and the prepared drug-loaded particles exhibited a considerable anti-proliferative activity against the human cancer cell line.",

Experiments in Erlenmeyer flasks with the compound at 30 μg L−1 showed that CLOF can be completely degraded at near environmentally relevant concentration after 4 days. The degradation process was scaled-up in an air-pulsed fluidized bioreactor operated in continuous mode with a hydraulic retention time of 4 days. The results show that 80% of the fed concentration (160 μg L−1) was reduced at the steady state (from day 12 to the end). Here, CLOF removal rate was 12.5 μg g−1 dry weight biomass d−1. The 2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-(hydroxymethyl)propanoic acid (hydroxy-CLOF) was identified as major metabolite, confirming the degradation of CLOF, but its concentration remained constant in the medium. In addition, in a batch bioreactor treatment the undegradability of hydroxy-CLOF was demonstrated. Finally, acute toxicity tests (Microtox) performed with the bacterium Vibrio fischeri showed that the final culture broth in both batch (15 min EC50 of 55%) and continuous (11%) experiments were more toxic than the beginning (61%).",

     "abstract": "The interest on use of lignocellulose for producing chemicals is increasing as these feedstocks are low cost, renewable and widespread sources of sugars. Corncob is an attractive raw material for xylitol production due to its high content of xylan. In this study, hemicellulose hydrolysate from corncobs without detoxification was used for xylitol production by Candida tropicalis CCTCC M2012462. Compared with prepared xylose medium, xylitol production with dilute acid hydrolysate medium does not seem to influence specific xylose reductase activity. The decrease in xylitol productivity with dilute acid hydrolysate medium is a result of a lower biomass concentration and lag-phase time. It appears that biomass growth rate is essential for xylitol production. In xylitol fermentation with a low initial inhibitors concentration and substrate feeding strategy, a maximal xylitol concentration of 38.8 g l−1 was obtained after 84 h of fermentation, giving a yield of 0.7 g g−1 xylose and a productivity of 0.46 g l−1 h−1.",

The experimental results suggest that d-Lysine (d-Lys) plays a pivotal role in the self-assembly and conformation of collagen fibrils than d-Alanine (d-Ala) and d-Glutamic acid (d-Glu). The SDS-PAGE, absorption spectrum and viscosity measurements indicate significant differences in the d-Lys crosslinked collagen when compared to other systems. The CD spectra show an increase in the peak intensity at 220 nm in the presence of d-Lys, which could be due to increase in propensity of the structure to form a triple helix. Modelling studies indicated that d-Lys bind with collagen-like peptide (CLP) through multiple H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions. d-Lys has the lowest binding energy (−4.2 kcal/mol, indicating strongest interactions) when compared to d-Ala and d-Glu (−3.6 and −3.7 kcal/mol, respectively). Orientational changes in the collagenase on CLP-d-Lys are observed which may decrease its accessibility to degradation and stabilise CLP against the action of the former. d-Lys has the lowest binding energy and improved fibrillar-assembly and staggered alignment without the undesired structural stiffness and aggregations. The information derived from the present study could help in designing heterochiral collagen-based biomaterial.",

The approach was shown on the example of the hydrolysis of summary casein by chymotrypsin (25 °C, pH 7.5). Kinetic analysis includes the determination of an apparent Michaelis constant that we regard as a function of the degree of peptide bond hydrolysis. Two sets of hydrolysis rate constants were used to calculate the parameters of a two-step model. It was found that kd is lower than the hydrolysis rate constants for specific sites consisting of aromatic amino acid residues, and at least a half of peptide bonds is initially masked in casein.

One possible approach to this issue is to control the culture environment to recapitulate the in vivo liver development. Given that the embryo is exposed to hypoxic condition in its early stage, hypoxic condition seems suitable for inducing early differentiation of ES cells. However, no studies have evaluated the effect of hypoxia on endodermal or early hepatic differentiation of ES cells. Here we investigated the potential role of hypoxia as a regulatory factor in endodermal and subsequent early hepatic differentiation of mouse ES cells. Under the stimulus of retinoic acid, a typical endodermal morphology emerged more dominantly under hypoxia (5% O2) than normoxia. Accordingly, quantitative RT-PCR revealed significant increase in Foxa2 and GATA4, essential transcription factors for endoderm specification. In addition, hypoxia amplified the effects of hepatic induction factors FGF1, FGF4 and HGF, which was evidenced by dramatically increased ALB-GFP-positive cell fraction, as well as increased gene expression levels of ALB, AFP, and CK18. Furthermore, the hepatic progenitor cells induced under hypoxic condition were efficiently differentiated into mature hepatocytes with ALB secretion ability. We also found that the differentiating cells did not consume oxygen even under normoxia, suggesting that oxygen per se might have a negative effect on the normal endodermal and early hepatic differentiation of ES cells. These results will provide useful insight into efficient production of hepatic progenitor cells, and contribute to stem cell-based liver tissue engineering.",

Regulating pH value and ion concentration in medium could control the formation of the precipitation.",

The results show that the total amounts of E1 and E2 (E1 + E2) in the water phase were approximately 9–23% of those in the sludge phase in the reactor tanks. The estrogens accumulated in the return sludge led to the increase in the estrogen concentration in the first-stage anoxic zone. The biodegradation of E1 and E2 in the first-stage aerobic zone was highly efficient. The sludge/water partition coefficients (Log Kd) of E1 and E2 were gradually increased from 2.3 and 2.6 in the first stage to 3.2 and 3.3 in the third stage, respectively, and Log Kd of E2 was higher than that of E1 in each A/O stage. In addition, the Log Kd values of E1 and E2 were larger in the aerobic zones than in the anoxic zones. Under six operation conditions tested, there was a linear relationship between the concentrations of E1 and E2 in the water phase, indicating the transformation between E1 and E2. The calculated mutual conversion equilibrium constant (K) for the transformation between E1 and E2 was significantly higher in the anoxic zones (0.38–0.81) than in the aerobic zones (0.08–0.24).",

Contents of other phenylpropanoid metabolites were enhanced and antioxidant activity was markedly stronger. Both SmCHS and SmRAS were stimulated by co-expression of DEL and ROS1.

The amount of data available has increased exponentially since the expansion of new biological drug development. Data are heterogeneous, sometimes inconsistent and incomplete, making them difficult to be systematically utilised for analysis for any new bioprocess design. In this paper, we report a novel computational method that harnesses the bioprocess experimental data to assist design decision making, and perhaps identify further needed experiments. First, we develop a new data representation structure to capture the experimental data systematically. Then the ontology for modelling the relationship of data properties is created. A computational system has been developed to search relevant data, or to predict required process conditions, or to suggest a new set of experiments for process development. A prototype for harnessing centrifugation experimental data has been built, and is then used to illustrate the method and demonstrate the type of results that can be obtained. Evaluations show that such a system has significant potential to mine the relevant experimental data to assist new drug bioprocess development, which should reduce process development time and cost.",

The problem with MFCs is that they are technically still very far from attaining acceptable levels of power output, since the performance of this type of fuel cells is affected by limitations based on irreversible reactions and processes occurring both on the anode and cathode side. However, in the last years, there has been a growing amount of work on MFCs which managed to increase power outputs by an order of magnitude.The present review article discusses a number of biological and engineering aspects related to improvement of MFC performance including the effect of important parameters, such as pH, temperature, feed rate, shear stress and organic load. The recent progresses on scale-up MFC are summarized and the different modelling approaches to describe the different biological and transport phenomena in MFCs are also provided.",

The final conversions corresponded well to predictions from a probability model. The variation of TAG composition with time was also measured to study the reaction kinetics. Initially, a reaction scheme was formulated allowing all possible acidolysis reactions of TAGs with stearic, palmitic and oleic fatty acids at the 1 and 3 TAG positions. It was found that a first order scheme produced good fits to data and that reactions involving stearic and palmitic reactions in equivalent positions produced very similar fitted rate constants. When these rate constants were constrained to be equal, acceptable fits were also obtained. As the acidolysis reactions occur via the formation of diacylglycerols (DAGs) by hydrolysis (7.1–10.9%), a further scheme was tested whereby all possible reactions involving DAGs were included (with equal rate constants for equivalent reactions with palmitic and stearic acid to limit the number of fit parameters). This produced only a small increase in goodness of fit. Assuming a single value of rate constant for all reactions produced poor fits.",

     "abstract": "For the cultivation of microorganisms shake flasks are frequently used. The development of the broth viscosity during the cultivation is usually not paid special attention to. However, changes in viscosity may have a severe impact on shake flask cultivations, ranging from effects on mass and heat transfer to the occurrence of out-of-phase conditions. Significant changes in viscosity were observed during batch cultivations with Bacillus licheniformis on defined mineral medium. The formed biopolymer was identified to be γ-polyglutamic acid (γ-PGA), a polymer, Bacillus species are known to excrete as a side-product. γ-PGA leads to increasing viscosity and, thus, has critical influences on shake flask cultivations. Consequently, the oxygen transfer is strongly influenced by viscosity and, therefore, γ-PGA formation. Furthermore, γ-PGA has chelating characteristics, which might affect nutrient and trace element availability, possibly resulting in substrate limitations. In total, these influences lead to undefined conditions in the fermentation. Therefore, the trigger for γ-PGA production was investigated. By performing continuous cultivation experiments as well as pulse experiments, catabolite controlled overflow was identified as one of the key triggers for γ-PGA production. The results suggest, that catabolite controlled overflow leads to inhibition of the 2-oxoglutarate complex, resulting in accumulation of 2-oxoglutarate and a redirection of metabolic flux toward glutamic acid and finally to γ-PGA. Additionally, oxygen limitations were determined to further potentiate γ-PGA production. As a result, fermentation conditions favoring catabolite controlled overflow as well as oxygen limitation need to be strictly avoided in order to assure defined conditions at low viscosity throughout the fermentation.",

The whole cell biocatalyst expressed the CV2025 ω-transaminase from Chromobacterium violaceum. Establishment of the most suitable reaction mechanism and determination of the complete forward and reverse kinetic parameter values for the reversible bioconversion where obtained using a hybrid methodology. This combined traditional initial rate experiments to identify a solution in the vicinity of the global minimum, with nonlinear regression methods to determine the exact location of the solution. The systematic procedure included selection and statistical evaluation of different kinetic models that best described the measured reaction rates and which ultimately provided new insights into the reaction mechanism; in particular the possible formation of a dead end complex between the amino donor and the cofactor enzyme complex. The hybrid methodology was combined with a microscale experimental platform, to significantly reduce both the number of experiments required as well as the time and material required for full kinetic parameter estimation. The equilibrium constant was determined to be 849, and the forward and reverse rate constants were found to be 97 and 13 min−1, respectively, which greatly favoured the asymmetric synthesis of chiral ABT. Using the established kinetic model, the asymmetric synthesis of ABT was simulated, and excellent agreement was found between the experimental and predicted data over a range of reaction conditions. A sensitivity analysis combined with various simulations suggested the crucial bottleneck of the reaction was the second half reaction of the ping pong bi–bi mechanism, in part due to the low Michaelis constant of substrate l-erythrulose (ERY). The toxicity of MBA towards the transaminase was identified as another major bottleneck. The kinetic model was useful to give early insights into the most appropriate bioconversion conditions, which can improve the rate and yield of ABT formation, as well as minimizing the toxicity and inhibition effects of the substrates and products. The systematic methodology developed here is considered to be generic and useful in regard to speeding up bioconversion process design and optimization.",

An attempt to enhance the decomposition of propionate by adding Fe0 powder (10 g) into an acidogenic reactor (A1) with propionate as the sole carbon source was made in this study. The results showed that the propionate conversion rate (67–89%) in A1 were higher than that in a reference reactor (43–77%) without dosing of Fe0 (A2). The enhanced conversion of propionate caused both chemical oxygen demand removal (COD) (57–79%) and acetate production (178–328 mg/L) in A1 to increase significantly. Although Fe0 contributed the H2 production chemically, the H2 content of A1 was less than that of A2. The reason was ascribed to the enhanced utilization of H2 for the homoacetogenesis. It was calculated that the Gibbs free energy in the decomposition of propionate was decreased by about 8.0–10.2% with the dosing of Fe0. Also, the activities of enzymes related to the acetogenesis were enhanced by 2–34-folds. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis indicated that Fe0 increased the abundance of microbial communities, especially propionate-utilizing bacteria and homoacetogenic bacteria.",

Optimum incubation temperature and pH of encapsulated enzyme did not show any significant difference with the free one. Evaluation of the thermal stability (at 35, 45 and 55 °C) shows that encapsulated enzyme was stable at 35 °C during in 6 h. Also decreased stability of encapsulated enzyme has been observed at 65 and 75 °C in 1 h. The results show increase of stability of encapsulated enzymes in pHs 7 and 8 (7 h), while it was decreased in acidic condition. Results indicate the gradually fulfilling proteolysis of casein by liposomal loaded Flavourzyme in comparison with the free enzyme.",

One of these strains, M. circinelloides NBRC 6746 produced 18.6 ± 0.6 g/l of ethanol from 50 g/l of GlcNAc after 72 h and the maximum ethanol production rate was 0.75 ± 0.1 g/l/h.

We also found an extracellular chitinolytic enzyme producing strain M. ambiguus NBRC 8092, and successfully improved ethanol productivity of NBRC 4572 from colloidal chitin using crude chitinolytic enzyme derived from NBRC 8092. The ethanol titer reached 9.44 ± 0.10 g/l after 16 days. These results were the first bioethanol production from GlcNAc and chitin substrates by native organisms, and also suggest that these Mucor strains have great potential for the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of chitin biomass.",

The conventional approach of capturing antibody from a clarified extract using packed-bed chromatography is therefore not particularly suitable. This study evaluates the suitability of using a combination of ultrafiltration and chromatography for purifying transgenic tobacco-derived human monoclonal antibody. A two-stage cascade ultrafiltration process removed about 97% impurities while ensuring almost complete recovery of antibody, providing 32-fold antibody enrichment in the process. The primary objective of the ultrafiltration step was to reduce the burden on the subsequent chromatographic steps. A two-step chromatographic process was then used to eliminate remaining impurities. Using this approach, recombinant human antibody expressed in tobacco could be purified to greater than 95% purity with 50% overall recovery (ca. 12.5 mg antibody/kg tobacco tissues).",

The inactivation of gfo had contrasting effects in different substrates, especially at high concentrations. The maximum specific growth rate (μm) and theoretical ethanol yield value (Ym) increased from 0.065 h−1 and 60.56% to 0.094 h−1 and 83.87% in 342 g/L sucrose, respectively.

In the last years, several studies not only clarified the biosynthetic pathway of spinosad, but also provided useful information of metabolic restrictions in the spinosyn biosynthetic pathway. However, these studies overlooked the problem that the spinosyn biosynthetic pathway was unbalanced: the expression of six genes in the spinosyn biosynthetic pathway was insufficient; Saccharopolyspora spinosa accumulated useless compounds because of insufficient expression of SpnK. So a rational strain improvement strategy was developed to tune the unbalanced spinosyn biosynthetic pathway. First, we overexpressed spnK to increase the amount of the flux from rhamnosylated aglycone to pseudoaglycones (PSA). Then six genes (spnP, spnO, spnN, spnQ, spnR, and spnS) involved in forosamine biosynthesis and spnK were co-expressed in S. spinosa LU102 to convert the accumulated PSA to spinosad. The yield of spinosad in S. spinosa LU102 was 214 mg/L, which was 2.6-fold higher than that in the wild-type S. spinosa (82 mg/L). Finally, spinosad production in the tuned S. spinosa LU104 was further increased to 405 mg/L, which was a 5.0-fold enhancement compared with the wild-type S. spinosa, by duplicating spnP, spnO, spnN, spnQ, spnR, spnS, spnK, gtt, gdh and kre genes.",

One of the approaches studied for making use of this material is the utilization of enzymes to hydrolyze the cell wall carbohydrates and generate fermentable sugars.

Expression of recombinant hydrolases through a co-culture strategy could be an interesting alternative for producing a recombinant cocktail at high levels of productivity that is tailor-made for each material to be hydrolyzed. In this study we evaluate the production of hydrolases by co-culturing two recombinant Escherichia coli, each expressing a specific hydrolase, β-1,3-1,4-glucanase or β-1,4-xylanase, both isolated from Bacillus subtilis. The cultures were conducted in bioreactors in batch and fed-batch mode in order to reach high cell densities.

The NIRS models were used to develop a novel, soft probe for CNR as an alternative to laborious, hourly, off-line analyses.

After the MFC treatment, the total organic carbon concentration in the raw lake water was reduced by 50%, the physicochemical nature of DOMs was substantially altered. Protein-like substances in lake water were utilized as a major substrate for the MFC, while humic-like substances were refractory to the biodegradation. A further investigation into the bovine serum albumin utilization in an MFC confirms that the electricity generation was closely associated with the removal of protein-like substrates. Toxicity assessment by Salmonella typhimurium Sal94 indicates that the genotoxic agents in the polluted lake water were almost completely removed after the MFC treatment. This approach of coupling microbially-catalyzed electricity generation with DOM removal may offer a potential avenue for energy-efficient bioremediation of lake water.",

In this paper, the systematic kinetics of taxol production by Taxus media cell suspension cultures in a stirred 15-L bioreactor under substrate-sufficient conditions and the absence of inducer intervention were studied. A kinetic model of cell growth was established by logistic equation, and kinetic unstructured models of substrate consumption, product synthesis and rheological behavior were constituted, which incorporated energy spilling. These models were verified by comparing the simulation results with those obtained experimentally. These results showed that energy spilling was a key factor that must be considered in constructing unstructured kinetic models of Taxus media cell suspension cultures in a stirred bioreactor under substrate-sufficient conditions. Besides, an optimized operation measure of decreasing energy spilling was proposed. An increase of 17.64% in cell biomass and 14.88% in taxol concentration were obtained when the strategy of limiting added carbon several times was experimentally implemented in a 15-L bioreactor. Results demonstrated that these established models should be helpful in the process prediction and operation optimization to guide the production and amplification of Taxus media cell suspension cultures in a bioreactor.",

     "abstract": "The protofibrils of amyloid fibrils have recently drawn an attention due to their cytotoxicity although the physicochemical properties of the protofibrils as an intermediate of fibrillation process have still remained unclear. We investigated the growth behavior of the protofibrils of amyloid β protein with 40 amino acid residues in the presence of various liposomes and the membrane perturbation (calcein leakage). The growth behavior of protofibrils was apparently correlated with the protofibrils-induced calcein leakage. From the binding experiment using a hydrophobic fluorescence probe and the quartz crystal microbalance method combined with the planar lipid membrane, it is suggested that the apparent correlation between the growth behavior of protofibrils and their membrane perturbation resulted from the physicochemical properties of protofibrils such as hydrophobicity and the stability of hydrogen bonds. The protofibrils were found to show the highest hydrophobicity and the highest instability of hydrogen bonds of the proteins used in this study (monomer, protofibrils, matured fibrils, and other three typical proteins). It is anticipated that such properties of protofibrils were advantageous both for the binding of protofibrils with monomer (growth behavior) and for the binding of lipid bilayer membranes (membrane perturbation).",

The kinetic study was performed at optimum experimental factors (temperature, initial water content, and enzyme concentration), which were determined using response surface methodology. Then, a model for predicting product–time progress curves was developed by expanding the obtained ping–pong model with terms describing ester hydrolysis. Kinetic constants of the reverse reaction were determined, and good congruence between the model and experimental data was achieved. Calculated kinetic constants revealed that lipase has the highest affinity for ascorbyl oleate, slightly lower activity with ascorbic acid, and the lowest activity with oleic acid.

The used liposomes were normal liposomes, raft-forming liposomes, charged liposomes and oxidized liposomes. Those liposome could accelerate the disaggregation rate of fibrils. From the comparison of normal and charged liposomes, a certain contribution of dopamine via an electrostatic interaction to the disaggregation was confirmed. From raft-forming and oxidized liposomes, we revealed a significant contribution of bound water to liposomes, which could assist the formation of the quinine-form of dopamine by a removal of its proton. It is, therefore, concluded that the membrane surface of liposomes is considered to be an adequate environment for the dopamine-induced disaggregation of fibrils.",

A pronounced correlation between enzyme activities and log P values of solvents, among the solvents with a broad spectrum of log P values, was observed. 93–98% yield of β-sitosteryl esters could be achieved with hexane as solvent, fatty acid (C8–C18)/β-sitosterol (1:1, mol:mol), 5–10% CAL A load at 40–50 °C for 24 h. This work demonstrated the promising potential of CAL A in bioprocess of phytosterols for value-added application.",

     "abstract": "Compared to immunoglobulin G purification with extensively studied affinity ligands such as protein A and protein G, little work has been done on affinity chromatographic purification of immunoglobulin M. Hexamer peptide ligand HWRGWV, previously shown to bind specifically to the Fc fragment of IgG, also demonstrated potential for IgM purification. This study presents further characterization and investigation of this ligand for its potential for purification of IgM. Different running conditions were employed in order to improve the recovery and purity of IgM. The final recovery and purity of the antibody is feedstock dependent, but can reach levels of both recovery and purity as high as 95%. The dependence of the recovery and purity on total loading amount and initial IgM concentration were investigated and discussed. Although relatively low dynamic binding capacities (DBC) in the range of 4.6–13.1 mg IgM/mL resin at linear flow rates from 173 to 35 cm/h were obtained for IgM compared to IgG because of the large molecular weight of IgM, the DBC value of HWRGWV for IgM is much greater than protein-based IgM affinity ligands found in the literature and is competitive with current commercially available affinity ligands, such as KAPTIVE-M, CaptureSelect IgM and Ultralink Immobilized Mannan Binding Protein.",

Supplementation with trace metals had either neutral or slightly negative effects with inoculums originating from reactors with a high background level of metals, such as those for the co-digestion of biowaste and waste activated sludge. For inoculums from reactors treating food waste only, which inherently contain low levels of trace metals, supplementation with these metals increased methane production. In particular, Mo concentrations in the range of 3–12 mg/kg dry matter and Se concentrations of 10 mg/kg dry matter increased methane production to as high as 30–40%. Supplementation with a metal mixture (Co, Mo, Ni, Se and W) increased the methane production to the range 45–65% for inoculums with low background concentrations of trace metals.

     "abstract": "The most common strategy to produce recombinant proteins using Escherichia coli as expression vector is fed-batch culture, since high cell density cultures strategies have successfully been applied. Several methodologies to limit the specific growth rate in order to control E. coli metabolism have been defined, demonstrating that cultures can be grown under glucose limitation up to high cell densities without accumulation of acetic acid. However, under induction conditions it has been observed that E. coli metabolism is reorganized again and leads to acetic acid accumulation, causing inhibition of cell growth and decreasing protein expression efficiency.We propose a double limitation strategy (glucose and IPTG) for E. coli fed-batch cultures to avoid the deregulation of the metabolism in the induction phase. Reducing the concentration of IPTG while keeping glucose growth limitation, the accumulation of acetic acid decreased. At an IPTG concentration of 0.03 mmol/g DCW no accumulation of acetic acid was observed during the induction phase, in contraposition to what has normally been observed.Although a slight reduction of protein expression rate was observed when applying this double limitation strategy, the bioprocess volumetric productivity was enhanced due to the capability to prolong the induction phase, reaching higher levels of protein production. Another advantage of this strategy is the reduction of media cost due to the lower level of IPTG used.",

     "abstract": "β-lg tryptic digestion leads to the release of a broad range of biologically active peptides. Understanding how these peptides are formed and the dynamics of the hydrolysis is of major relevance in order to control the quality of the final products. In this paper, the time-dependent release of peptides is reported and the dynamics of this release is discussed in terms of the physical accessibility of the enzyme to the scissile bonds and the secondary specificity of trypsin. In view of experimental data, a kinetic model based on first-order equations is proposed to simulate both β-lg degradation and peptide formation. The statistical data obtained seem to support the hypothesis that the hydrolysis mainly takes place via the proposed model. The results evaluated in this paper show the existence of areas within the intact protein with different susceptibility to tryptic attack. Whereas C- and N-terminal areas are easily digested, the internal part of the protein shows more resistance to hydrolysis and the release of final peptides within this region passes through the formation and subsequent degradation of intermediate peptides.",

MSU-H silica was modified by nonionic surfactant of triblock copolymer Pluronic P123, amino-functionalization and glutaraldehyde-grafting and confirmed by FT-IR analysis.

The surfactant located inside the silicas could interfacially activate the immobilized CRLs and favored catalytic esterification. The biocatalyst containing 38 wt.% of surfactant afforded 1111.1 U/mg of specific activity about eight times higher than soluble CRL, and maximal 56.7% of total CLA esterification with 96.5% of 9c, 11t-CLA isomer esterification degree.

The data from all techniques (except particle sizing) could be fitted to simple exponential decay models at various homogenization pressures. Turbidity, particle sizing and UV absorbance generally gave more conservative estimates of the extent of cell disruption compared to protein release and cell counting.

Experimental results showed that the concentration of soluble organic matters increased gradually with temperature during the mild thermal pretreatment of excess sludge.

The results show that the specific power input and specific interface area are both greatly influenced by shaking frequency and filling volume. For the positive effect of shaking frequency on both mass transfer coefficient (kL) and specific interface area (a), the volumetric mass transfer coefficient (kLa) increases greatly with shaking frequency. Results also show that filling volume has no significant effect on kL but negative effect on specific interface area. Shear force formed in baffled flask shows great dependent on shaking frequency, but it is insensitive to the filling volume. Based on these investigations, correlations linking these parameters are proposed. Finally, cultivations of filamentous fungus conducted in unbaffled and baffled flasks validated the simulating results.",

Since acetate and propionate are the two most common substrates present in real domestic wastewater, this paper further assesses the P removal performances in the AEI process using acetate and propionate as the sole carbon source. The results showed that 3.91 and 3.64 mg of P/g of total suspended solids were, respectively, removed in the acetate-reactor and propionate-reactor after 50 days, respectively. After 90 days P removal in the propionate-reactor increased to 4.91 mg P/g of total suspended solids whereas that in the acetate-reactor kept in the same level (3.98 mg/g). Though both acetate and propionate could be used as carbon sources for P removal in such a novel system, the latter was more effective after long-term operation. Further investigations showed that, after 90 days’ acclimatization, sludge poly-P content in the propionate-system was more than that in the acetate-system, which was the primarily reason for the propionate-system showing higher P removal.",

The correlation was no longer linear when cell density per carrier exceeded 100% cell confluency corresponding to 150 cells MC−1 (0.15 × 106 cells cm−2). This behaviour was attributed to the decrease of cell volume when cells saturated MCs surface. It mainly happened when low MCs concentration and continuous medium renewing were used.

Herein, the counteraction of trehalose on the acid-induced unfolding of ferricytochrome c was studied at pH 2.0. Far-UV circular dichroism, Soret absorption and fluorescence spectra indicate that trehalose inhibits acid-induced protein denaturation and induces the formation of MG state. The kinetics of the counteracting effects of trehalose was investigated by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. It is found that the unfolding of ferricytochrome c displays three phases (i.e., fast, intermediate and slow phases) in the absence of trehalose. At trehalose <0.8 M, the unfolding transition still occurs in three phases, but at trehalose >0.8 M, it is transformed into a biphasic process without the fast phase. The rate constants for all the unfolding phases decrease linearly with increasing trehalose concentration. Meanwhile, the increase in the fluorescence intensity for the fast and intermediate phases diminishes with the increment of trehalose concentration. Nevertheless, there is little influence of trehalose on the fluorescence intensity change in the slow phase.

Based on a sensitivity analysis of the model outputs with respect to the parameters, a model reduction is proposed. Finally, the maximization of biomass productivity of hybridoma cell fed-batch cultures is analyzed. This model allows, on the one hand, quantitatively describing overflow metabolism in mammalian cell cultures and, on the other hand, will be valuable for monitoring and control of fed-batch cultures in order to optimize the process. This is illustrated in this contribution with the determination of optimal feeding profiles aiming at maximizing biomass productivity.",

Thermolysin-catalyzed synthesis of Z-aspartame (N-carbobenzoxy-l-aspartame) in which ionic liquids play dual roles as both substrate and reaction medium was conducted. If the protease can retain catalytic activity in this new liquefied amino acid substrate/media, the effective substrate concentration can be maximized, leading to theoretically high yields. In fact, we observed a 34-fold enhancement in the catalytic activity compared with that obtained in a previous report. The yield of Z-aspartame reached at approximately 660 mM at 24 h with 50 mg mL−1 of the enzyme, thus submolar range productivity was achieved. The results suggest the successful construction of a high productivity reaction system for peptide synthesis.",

     "abstract": "Water quality is questionable when looking at the emerging pollutants that accumulate in hydrosphere day after day. In terms of water treatments to eliminate organic compounds, biological treatments are the most used technique, especially the conventional activated sludge (CAS) process. Unfortunately, several of these compounds such as petroleum and industrial wastes, some pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and hormonal substances appear to be refractory to such treatments and can join the different water surfaces from other natural environments especially contaminated soils. Physical and chemical treatments, in particularly the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are able to degrade some of these pollutants, but the nature and the possible effects of oxidation by-products remain controversial when complete mineralization does not occur. The aim of this article is to shed light on new and renewed biotechnological techniques recently introduced to resolve recalcitrance problem. Amending activated sludge with additional microorganisms able to produce versatile enzymes to enhance biodegradability or “bioaugmentation”, is gradually considered as a possible solution for the recalcitrance of Bio-Refractory Organic Compounds (Bio-ROCs). The use of this technique, traditionally in soil remediation field, and recently in water and sediments treatment is reviewed in this paper.",

The decomposition of CA during bacterial fermentation reduces its concentration in the broth, resulting in low yields. This study investigated the use of temperature reduction to obtain high CA production during fermentation employing cultures of S. clavuligerus. Simple batch cultures, and batch cultures with glycerol pulses, were performed at different temperatures in shake flasks at 250 rpm, and pH 6.8. Firstly, three batch cultures using glycerol as carbon source were carried out at temperatures of 30 (control), 25, and 20 °C. Next, three batch cultures were carried out with temperature reductions from 30 to 25 °C, 30 to 20 °C, and 25 to 20 °C, after glycerol exhaustion. CA production generally increased in cultures with temperature reduction and glycerol feeding. Maximum CA concentration of 1534.3 mg L−1 was achieved in a culture maintained at a constant temperature of 20 °C, with one pulse of glycerol. Under these conditions, both glycerol uptake rate and CA degradation were low. The results obtained demonstrate the potential of temperature reduction in the optimization of CA production by S. clavuligerus.",

The results of different combinations of α-l-arabinofuranosidases (EC 3.2.1.55), one derived from Aspergillus niger (AFAn) and one from Bifidobacterium adolescentis (AFBa), respectively, a β-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37) from Trichoderma reesei, and an engineered D11F/R122D variant of Bacillus subtilis XynA endo-1,4-β-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) were examined. The two selected α-l-arabinofuranosidases catalyze liberation of arabinose residues linked 1 → 3 to singly (AFAn) or doubly (AFBa) substituted xyloses in arabinoxylan, respectively. When added to arabinoxylan at equimolar levels, the AFBa enzyme catalyzed the release of more arabinose, i.e. had a higher rate constant than AFAn, but with respect to the xylose release, AFAn – as expected – exhibited a better synergistic effect than AFBa with β-xylosidase. This synergistic effect with AFAn was estimated to increase the number of β-xylosidase catalyzed cuts from ∼3 (with β-xylosidase alone) to ∼7 in each arabinoxylan substrate molecule. However, the synergistic effects between β-xylosidase and the α-l-arabinofuranosidases on the xylose release were low as compared to the effect of xylanase addition with β-xylosidase, which increased the xylose release by ∼25 times in 30 min, to a yield equivalent to ∼104 β-xylosidase catalyzed cuts in each arabinoxylan substrate molecule. At equimolar addition levels of the four enzymes, the xylanase activity was thus rate-limiting for the β-xylosidase catalyzed depolymerization to release xylose from arabinoxylan. The work provides clues to design efficient enzymatic degradation of arabinoxylan into fermentable monosaccharides.",

However wide the usage of such vessels is, their design is not based on chemical engineering data, but is still rather empirical. Thus, it is highly desirable to have a tool for the rational design of agitated gas–liquid contactors that is based on fundamental chemical engineering parameters that are transferable to other systems and operating conditions. Focusing on liquid film-controlled processes and using the data from fermenters of different scales, we develop kLa correlations that are suitable for scale-up.First, we discuss the way how to determine the proper experimental kLa values, which are not distorted by other equipment parameters as the gas residence time is. We demonstrate the possible kLa distortion on the pilot-plant experimental data by the comparison of the results obtained by two different experimental techniques. Further, we present physically correct kLa data for coalescent (pure water) and fully non-coalescent (sodium sulphate solution) batches. The data are presented both for laboratory and for pilot-plant fermenters. We identify the process parameters, the values of which are dependent on the vessel scale when operated under the same power input per unit volume, and, using these parameters, we develop common kLa correlations suitable to describe the data for various scales of the vessel.The correlations developed reduce the uncertainty in predicting the volume of industrial scale fermenters from almost 1/2 to 1/4 of their total volume, thereby enabling significant reductions in both the initial costs and operating costs.",

Zmd30 isolated from a hydrogen-producing anaerobic sludge. First, the effects of glucose concentration and nitrogen source on 2,3-BDO production with the Zmd30 strain were examined. The results show that the productivity and concentration of 2,3-BDO reached the highest values of 0.92 g/l/h and 58 g/l, respectively, when the glucose concentration was in the range of 160–180 g/l. Urea was a better nitrogen source when considering both the 2,3-BDO production performance and the cost. Next, medium composition for the growth of the Zmd30 strain was optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM) to enhance 2,3-BDO production. Based on the RSM analysis, the optimal composition of glucose, urea and MnCl2·4H2O, H3BO3 and CoCl2·6H2O was 160, 2.28, 7.01 × 10−4, 1.49 × 10−4 and 5.70 × 10−3 g/l, respectively. With this optimal medium, the 2,3-BDO productivity was improved to 1.15 g/l/h. To reduce the production cost, bagasse and rice straw were used as feedstock for 2,3-BDO production. It was found that using hydrolyzed rice straw resulted in better productivity than using hydrolyzed bagasse, as the highest productivity (2.08 g/l/h) and yield (62%) were obtained at an initial rice straw concentration of 150 g/l.",

The DCO2 concentration profiles depict evolution patterns that depend on the extent of glucose utilized. A mass balance for DCO2 was proposed by taking into account the physiochemical behavior of CO2 and biological processes occurring under VHG ethanol fermentation conditions. The proposed equations could interpret the underlying CO2 desorption, CO2 conversion, and CO2 evolution on the basis of yeast activity during VHG ethanol fermentation. Consequently for 150 and 200 ± 0.21 g glucose/L absence of yeast activity was interpreted in terms of zero CO2 evolution rate (CER(t)). In contrast, under 250 ± 0.12 and 300 ± 0.28 g glucose/L conditions the presence of non-zero residual glucose resulted in non-zero CER(t).

The influences of amino acids side chain group, tie line length (TLL) of ATPS, nonionic surfactant type and PEG molecular weight on the partitioning coefficients of amino acids were extensively studied. The results displayed that the hydrophilic amino acid preferred to partition in the top PEG-rich phase, and the hydrophobic amino acid preferred to the bottom surfactant-rich phase. These distribution trends of amino acids in PEG/nonionic surfactant ATPS were more obvious with increasing TLL, while the PEG molecular weight had no significant effect on the amino acids partitioning in ATPS. Moreover, the estimated hydrophobic factor (HF) values of PEG/nonionic surfactant ATPS should be about −10−2 mol/kJ according to the amino acids partitioning, which demonstrated that the bottom surfactant-rich phase was generally more hydrophobic than the top PEG-rich phase. PEG20000/Triton X-100 ATPS had more extensive HF values scope (−0.0038 to −0.0496 mol/kJ) than PEG20000/Tween 80 ATPS (HF −0.0162 to −0.0306 mol/kJ) in the investigated TLL due to the different micelles size and number.

When the mixed culture was grown on the optimal medium comprising 60 g/L glucose, 0.5 g/L FeSO4·7H2O and 5.13 g/L yeast extract, the maximal tolerant butanol concentration, butanol production, hydrogen production and glucose consumption were ca. 16 g/L, 10.64 ± 0.60 g/L, 4153 ± 815 mL/L and 54.99 ± 1.92 g/L, respectively. Moreover, almost all the dose–response curves representing toxicity potency of butanol on microbial characteristics was nearly identical in order of magnitude. Thus, although generations of by-products during butanol fermentation are interactive, the maintenance of microbial growth capability still plays a crucial role to control the performance of butanol production. The quantitative findings in toxicological terms directly suggest that the BtOH toxicity seemed to be inevitable during BtOH production. In addition, butanol inhibition could be reversibly attenuated by removal of butanol to make it below the critical level (ca. 7.83–9.52 g/L or EC50).",

Hence, there is demand of developing new redox systems that can accelerate the oxidative refolding of this protein. In this work, a new redox system composed of 4-mercaptobenzeneacetate (ArSH) and hexanoyl cystamine (HCA) was proposed. It was found that the oxidative refolding of RNase A reached a refolding yield of 94% in 2 h with ArSH/HCA at optimized concentrations, which was two times faster than that with GSH/GSSG. Moreover, the refolding yield of RNase A from IBs could also reach 89% in 3 h with ArSH/HCA, much better than the performance with GSH/GSSG, which was only 69% in 8 h refolding. Therefore, the use of the new redox system led to a significant increase of refolding yield and over 60% reduction in the refolding time in the inclusion body protein refolding. The results indicated that the new redox system was much more efficient in the oxidative refolding of RNase A than the traditional redox system.",

Three types of composite polyamide nanofiltration membranes (NF2, NF3 and NF20) manufactured by Sepro Co. (USA) were used in nanofiltration. Lactic acid fermentation broth produced by fermentation of sugar cane juice by Lactobacillus plantarum in a membrane-integrated hybrid reactor system was filtered by NF membranes after preliminary filtration through microfiltration membranes for cell separation and recycle. Effects of cross flow rate, transmembrane pressure and pH on flux and rejection of both acid and unconverted sugars for recycle were analyzed. NF3 membrane was successful in retaining 94% unconverted sugars while allowing 32% lactic acid to permeate at a flux of 113 L m−2 h−1 at pH 5.5, temperature 37 °C, transmembrane pressure of 13 bar and cross-flow velocity 2.48 m s−1. The study shows that integration of a properly selected nanofiltration membrane with a cell-recycle fermentation unit and lactate conversion unit can yield l (+) lactic acid with an optical purity of 85.6% through an economically attractive route by recovering and recycling of unconverted sugars. The nanofiltration combine with bipolar electrodialysis in downstream purification can replace the multiple purification steps by two steps while yielding a monomer grade lactic acid from a mixture of unconverted sugars and lactic acid.",

     "abstract": "Multi-product biopharmaceutical facilities need flexible process configurations that can adapt to products with diverse characteristics and impurity loads so as to avoid bottlenecks and delays, whilst meeting final product specifications and cost targets. In order to aid the design of such facilities, this work presents a meta-heuristic optimisation approach using genetic algorithms where different levels of decision are addressed (facility, product sequence and unit operation) and multiple process and business criteria are used to evaluate each alternative generated. This is applied to a case study on the production of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), with a focus on the optimal purification sequences and chromatography column sizing strategies to cope with different facility configurations of upstream and downstream trains and different product impurity loads. The industrial case study provides novel insights that allow the identification of the most cost-effective purification sequences and column sizing strategies that meet demand and purity targets for each product in the facility. Emphasis is placed also on providing methods to visualise the trade-offs in the set of optimal solutions with similar cost values so as to enhance the decision making process.",

The results showed that HSA molecules displayed different adsorption behaviors on NIBC enantiomers modified surfaces and preferred to be adsorbed on the l-NIBC modified surface. That is to say, l-NIBC modified surface had stronger interaction with HSA molecules than d-NIBC modified surface, suggesting that the molecular configuration of l-NIBC had matched better with HSA than the case of d-NIBC.

Two GF-immobilizable scaffolds, namely single hepatocyte-embedded, heparin-immobilized, collagen-gel-filled polyurethane foam, and hepatocyte spheroid-embedded, heparin-immobilized, collagen-gel-filled polyurethane foam were developed by covalently incorporating heparin into collagen gel, using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide for hepatocyte transplantation. Seventy percent partial hepatectomy (PH) was performed at the same time after hepatocyte transplantation. Angiogenesis efficiency and viability of transplanted cells are discussed in terms of normalized hemoglobin content, nuclear density and histological observations after transplantation. In summary, the normalized hemoglobin content and viability of transplanted cells were higher in GF-immobilized scaffolds with PH pretreatment than in the other scaffolds with/without PH pretreatment. These materials have the potential for in vivo hepatocyte transplantation, as GFs released from remnant liver were easily incorporated into the heparin-immobilized collagen gel system. These GF–heparin complexes may promote the survival of embedded cells. Furthermore, the transplantation of spheroids promoted increased angiogenesis compared with hepatocytes, and resulted in sufficient vascularization for cell survival.",

The presented dialysis shake flask allows small-scale fed-batch cultivations by a diffusion driven nutrient release. It consists of a feed reservoir system which is filled with a highly concentrated nutrient solution. The nutrient diffuses through a dialysis membrane into the medium. Cultivations with Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pRhotHi-2-EcFbFP and Hansenula polymorpha RB11 pC10-FMD (PFMD-GFP) proved the feasibility of the concept. As positive effects of these small-scale fed-batch cultivations, enhanced (up to 1000fold) yields for catabolite repressed product formation, reduced overflow metabolism and diminished medium acidification were observed. The new dialysis fed-batch shake flask is characterised by a high flexibility regarding the attainable feed rates and the spectrum of feedable compounds. The feed rate can be adjusted in a broad range by simply adapting the diffusion parameters. Based on the working principle, the release of any desired compound is possible. The dialysis fed-batch shake flask allows the detailed investigation of strains and process conditions under operation mode similar to industrial production process. Combined with the Respiration Activity Monitoring System (RAMOS), it represents an effective screening tool for the first steps of bioprocess development.",

In the dual-promoter constructs described here, a pET30a-derived BioBrick base vector was built for the standard assembly of two targeted genes. Compared with monocistronic constructs, the crude enzyme expressed from a bicistronic construct (xyn located upstream of bgl) and a dual-promoter construct (xyn located upstream of bgl) offered the comparable activity of two recombinant proteins.

Despite the low initial water content of 0.36%, the methyl ester content in the effluent from the second column increased similarly in a wide range of contents of water (0–20%) added, which shows the water-content-independent reaction in this column in contrast to the reaction in the first column. Further investigations using reaction mixture models suggested a contribution of the composition of the reaction mixture to the phenomenon. On the basis of these findings, the sequential methanolysis through six columns was attempted, where the upper layer of the effluent from each column was supplied into the next column without further addition of water. Consequently, an aqueous plant oil emulsion with 3% water was converted into the final product with 96.1% methyl ester and 0.15% water.

However, the lignin present in the PHL is an inhibitor of fermentation processes, and thus should be isolated from the PHL prior to fermentation. In this study, a new process was proposed for isolating the lignin of PHL by overliming and surfactant treatment. The fundamentals associated with the interactions of lignin, surfactants and calcium hydroxide were discussed. In the experimental part of this work, three different cationic surfactants were applied to industrially produced PHL, and the most effective one, dodecyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (DTAC), was selected for further analysis. The optimum dosage of 0.3% DTAC/PHL was identified via turbidity and particle size analyses. Additionally, overliming via CaO treatment resulted in removing 36.1% lignin and 23% hemicelluloses. Overliming followed by the DTAC treatment was more effective than the DTAC treatment followed by overliming in removing lignin. In the former, the maximum removals of 43.6% lignin and 27% hemicelluloses were obtained. The formation of lignocelluloses/surfactant complexes was confirmed by means of a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermo gravimetric analyzer (TGA).",

In previous works, it was shown that the occurrence of production and the antibiotics concentration could be related to gas–liquid transfer and power dissipation in shaking flasks. Nevertheless, in standard cultures, both mechanisms are coupled. It is then a difficult task to assign a precise physiological response to either oxygen transfer or power dissipation. The aim of the present study was to decouple the oxygen transfer coefficient (kLa) and the power dissipation per unit of volume (P/V) to study their respective impact on pristinamycin production. During cultures in flasks, the rotation diameter of the shaking table was changed to modify the kLa but not the power dissipation P/V. The influence of operating conditions with P/V ranging from 0.55 to 10.3 kW m−3 and kLa ranging from 30 to 490 h−1 have been determined on the microbial kinetics and also on the pellet diameters. The final biomass concentration and the release of antibiotics were then related to kLa, whereas the final pristinamycins concentrations, as well as the bacterial pellet diameter were mainly correlated to P/V independently of the kLa. The change in the pellet diameter could be the crucial parameter for the pristinamycins production as it might influence the nutriment transfer inside the pellets and the ratio of active cells in each pellet.",

The developed model adequately described the experimental data to the extent of 99% accuracy as tested by statistical validity test. The batch model was then extrapolated to fed-batch cultivation primarily to identify fresh nutrient feeding strategies (off-line on the computer) for enhanced production of 1,3-PD. Experimental implementation of one such fed-batch fermentation strategy involving constant feed rate and subsequent comparison of the observed kinetics with model simulation further established the accuracy of the developed model.

     "abstract": "Microalgae are currently cultivated on a relatively small scale for nutritional products, supplements and aquaculture feed. In recent years there has been renewed interest in algal bioenergy, which would require cultivation at far greater scales. A key component of large-scale production systems is the delivery of CO2 to the algal cells, which is often a limiting factor in ponds and air sparged systems. Although many methods of CO2 supplementation to algal reactors have been investigated, the most commonly suggested method is still the direct injection of CO2 enriched gas into the growth medium. A sound understanding of CO2 gas–liquid mass transfer is critical to efficient operation of cultivation systems as mixing and gas compression may represent significant operational expenses. For carbon capture or sequestration through algal culture, CO2 recovery is equally important, particularly where carbon trading is involved. Chlorella vulgaris was grown in internal loop airlift reactors under varied CO2 partial pressures in the inlet gas. In these reactors, with an overall mass transfer coefficient of 0.0094 s−1, an inlet CO2 partial pressure of 0.0012 atm (1200 ppm CO2 by volume) was sufficient to overcome any mass transfer limitations. Under these operating conditions, a CO2 recovery of 26% resulted. Increasing the partial pressure of CO2 in the inlet gas above 0.0012 atm did not increase the algal productivity and caused significant decreases in CO2 recovery to 9.7% and 2.1% at inlet CO2 partial pressures of 0.00325 atm and 0.0145 atm respectively. Much research into algal growth is done without analysis of CO2 gas–liquid mass transfer, using influent CO2 partial pressures well in excess of the minimum value required to overcome CO2 gas–liquid mass transfer limitations, even in poorly mixed systems. This could result in algal growth being optimised under conditions that are not industrially practical or desirable.",

     "abstract": "The performance of a membrane bioreactor (MBR), and mechanisms of fouling formation, may differ due to the start-up. Therefore, the start-up can constitute an aspect that critically influences MBR performance during its lifespan. Indeed, the start-up can influence the mechanisms of membrane fouling, which is of paramount importance in an MBR. In order to gain insights on the effects of the start-up, both experimental and mathematical modelling studies were carried out on an MBR pilot plant. The MBR pilot plant constituted of a hollow fibre membrane module, in a submerged configuration, was fed by real wastewater. Two experimental periods were carried out, lasting 65 days each, characterised by two different MBR start-ups: without inoculum of activated sludge, and with inoculum of activated sludge. An integrated MBR mathematical model was applied to the two periods in order to combine the insights gained from the experimental survey. The MBR model simulates both biological and physical processes simultaneously, taking into account the interactions between them. Two MBR model calibrations were carried out for the two different experimental start-ups. Model calibration was carried out by means of an innovative calibration protocol, based on the global sensitivity analysis, and the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation. Thus, two sets of model parameters were assessed and compared. Both experimental and mathematical model results were analysed to quantify the effects of the two start-ups on membrane fouling. The results showed only slight differences in terms of total pollutant removal efficiency. However, relevant differences appeared with respect to the fouling phenomenon between the two start-ups. The results demonstrated that the best choice, in terms of the start-up of MBR systems, comes from a compromise between minimisation of the fouling issues and high system performance.",

We designed a single chamber BES to investigate hydrogen production from artificial garbage slurry. A 3-electrode system was applied and the potential of the working electrode was regulated to −1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Thus, the potential on the counter electrode was 1.38 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Hydrogen fermentation in the BES was initiated by methanogenic seed sludge. The BES achieved a hydrogen production rate of 2196 mL L−1 day−1 at an organic loading rate of 58.7 g dichromate chemical oxygen demand L−1 day−1. Acetate and butyrate were the main products, indicating that favorable hydrogen fermentation occurred in the system. Combination of high potential on the counter electrode and relatively low pH condition (5.5–6.4) was effective for constructing hydrogen fermentation even in single chamber system by inhibiting methanogenesis. However, it may be necessary to increase the space between the working and counter electrodes so as to decrease the electrical input.

The sugar (glucose plus xylose) yield reached 64.3% and remained the same until the biomass loading of 15% (w/v) after which, it dropped.

Herein, we report the development of a semicontinuous process for the extractive bioconversion in an ATPS coupled with a simple and easy to scale up process for polymer recycling as an effective alternative to improve production of recombinant A. albopictus AKR in P. pastoris. Six repetitive batches of the extractive bioconversion were conducted in a semicontinuous process by replacing 2/3 of the culture and recycling the top polymeric phase every 72 h. Overall process in a 5-L fermentor yielded a protein concentration in the bottom phase of 0.46 ± 0.13 mg mL−1 and 6 g of total purified protein in 490 h with a reduction of 25% of the operation time and 27% of the operation cost when compared to the fed-batch ATPS process.

     "abstract": "An emerging paradigm to quickly and cost-effectively manufacture virus-like particle (VLP) biopharmaceuticals involves VLP subunit production in highly productive bacterial hosts, followed by assembly in a controlled cell-free environment. Study of cell-free VLP assembly has yet to progress beyond laboratory-based dialysis methods, which are slow and buffer intensive, and are thus difficult to scale. In this study, a scalable cell-free VLP assembly and formulation process using a single diafiltration unit was developed. A reactive constant volume diafiltration VLP assembly process was systematically and quantitatively designed to maximize VLP yield. Using a dilute concentration of capsomeres during VLP assembly minimized membrane-induced aggregation. Optimizing the assembly buffer exchange rate, and the rapid introduction of calcium ions to the assembly mix, facilitated the propitious assembly of VLPs. An absolute increase in VLP yield of 42–56%, compared to initial laboratory-scale batch diafiltration assembly processes, was achieved. The optimized process produced high-quality VLPs (PDI = 1.08 ± 0.01) at high yield (78%). The constant volume diafiltration method has the added advantage of being scalable and represents a high level of process intensification. The methodology reported in this study, based on quantitative analysis of the influences of process changes, is consistent with modern engineering approaches, and can ultimately lead to cheaper and quicker VLP manufacturing routes and hence the accelerated translation of products from laboratory settings.",

To achieve this, a laboratory-scale trial was carried out using the mechanically recovered organic fraction of municipal solid waste mixed with either sheep blood or a mixture of pig intestines with flotation fat. Both of these co-substrates are difficult to digest in isolation because of their high nitrogen and lipid concentrations, and are regulated as Category 3 materials under the Animal By-Products Regulations (EC 1069/2009). The results showed that at an organic loading rate of 2 kg VS m−3 day−1 with the slaughterhouse material making up 20% of the load on a volatile solids basis the process could operate successfully. As the loading was increased to 4 kg VS m−3 day−1 signs of inhibition appeared with both co-substrates, however, and volumetric methane production was reduced to a point where co-digestion gave no process advantage. The main operational problem encountered was an increase in the concentration of volatile fatty acids in the digestate, particularly propionic acid: this was thought to be a result of ammonia toxicity. The concentration of potentially toxic elements in the digestate made it unsuitable for agricultural application for food production, although the increased nitrogen content made it more valuable as a fertiliser for non-food crop use.",

     "abstract": "A comprehensive optimization of fermentation processes is non-trivial due to the interdependence of individually well-studied fermentation parameters. Two such important parameters are the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) and the ratio of two critical nutrients (CNR) in the broth. Since CNR is easily measurable, it was investigated for its efficacy in process optimization. Phosphofructokinase activity (PFK) was used as a supplementary marker of productivity. The strong correlations between the above parameters motivated optimization of fermentations using four industrially useful microbes: Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris, Streptomyces species and Aspergillus niger. The relevance of CNR was independent of dissolved oxygen and nutrient sources, even though the nutrient release and its consequent availability depended upon the nutrient type and source. Planned changes in CNR lead to a 3 fold and a 3–5 fold increase in PFK and specific productivity respectively. The ATP and citrate levels beyond 2.5 mmol (g cell)−1 inhibited PFK. A mathematical model was developed to explain the relationship between PFK and its effectors: CNR, ATP, and citrate. By optimizing CNR, the respective maximum productivities were increased by a minimum of 34%, 100%, 57% and 30% compared to the respective controls for above processes.",

The combination of WDM treatment and HP treatment (WDM–HP treatment) significantly increased the removal of lignin and xylan.

Among the four target genes, Atg9A was the only gene showing decreased levels of mRNA and protein simultaneously when comparing the expression in the late period of the culture showing the maximum level of autophagy with that in the control time point (Day 4). In order to verify the potential of Atg9A as an autophagy induction target, Atg9A was overexpressed in rCHO cells using the Tet-Off System. However, Atg9A overexpression did not significantly influence the autophagy induction and culture longevity. Taken together, the results obtained here demonstrate that the downregulation of Atg9A is not the sole limiting factor for autophagy induction in serum-free suspension cultures of rCHO cells.

These results demonstrate that, unlike the previously reported pure extracellular reduction pathways for many compounds, intracellular reactions are involved in NB bioreduction by S. oneidensis MR-1, and CymA plays an important role in the electron transfer of the intracellular NB bioreduction. In addition, the participation of some unknown protein other than CymA in NB reduction is discovered, and the possible pathways of electron transfer in the NB reduction by S. oneidensis MR-1 are proposed.",

     "abstract": "Cryptosporidium is a waterborne protozoan parasite, which is problematic for the water industry due to widespread environmental presence, low infectious dose and resistance to chlorine disinfection. To replace the existing, slow regulatory monitoring procedure, immunosensors have been proposed. The performance of such sensors is often limited by the antibody immobilization. The aim of this article was to determine the immobilization protocol offering the highest oocyst capture efficiency. Four methods were tested both under static and convective conditions: physisorption, cysteamine–glutaraldehyde linkage, 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane functionalization and protein G linkage. The protein G protocol was shown to present the highest recovery rates in both conditions. For the protein G protocol, different antibody concentrations were tested and it was concluded that there is little difference in the recovery rates when the concentration of IgG antibody is higher than 20 μg/mL. Additionally, operation under convective rather than static conditions increased the recovery for every protocol. These results can be useful to inform the design of future biosensor systems, using antibodies as the detection element, for Cryptosporidium.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this research was to study the effect of the dual treatment of sorghum decortication and protease addition during liquefaction with α-amylase, on the concentration of free amino nitrogen (FAN), fusel alcohols and ethanol during yeast fermentation. A bifactorial experiment was designed to revise the differences among grains (maize, whole and 9.7% decorticated sorghum) and the effectiveness of protease addition during liquefaction. The decorticated sorghum was more susceptible to protein hydrolysis compared to the whole kernel sorghum due to its lower fiber content. The protease improved the levels of FAN approximately to 60% and 30% in the maize and sorghum mashes, respectively. The maize mash contained the highest amount of FAN followed by the decorticated and whole sorghum mashes. The protease treatment improved the fusel alcohol concentration in both sorghum beers and did not affect ethanol concentration in the maize mash. Both sorghum decortication and protease addition during liquefaction are therefore recommended treatments to obtain mashes with a higher FAN level. The decorticated protease-treated sorghum mashes yielded higher amounts of ethanol compared to the maize treatments and produced the maximum ethanol after only 20 h of fermentation. This research proved that a positive synergistic effect on FAN concentration, fusel alcohols and bioethanol yields can be achieved through the proposed proceeding of sorghum decortication and protease addition.",

The physical properties of the granular sludge were very good (SVI ≈ 20 mL g−1) and high solid concentrations (up to 35 g L−1) were obtained in the bioreactor operated with a pre-anoxic phase with additional nitrate (R1). In contrast, performance and granule settleability were lower in R2 due to the development of filamentous heterotrophic bacteria on the surface of granules. These disturbances were linked to the fact that a fraction of COD remained during the aerobic phase, which was not stored during the anaerobic period. To stabilize a GSBR with a mixture of organic carbon sources, it is thus necessary to maximize the amount of substrate used during the non-aerated, anaerobic or anoxic, phase. Comparable phosphate removal efficiency was observed in both systems; enhanced biological P removal being greater in anaerobic/aerobic conditions, while the contribution of precipitation (Ca–P) was more significant in anoxic/aerobic conditions.",

Several textural and chemical characterizations were performed on the alga and its activated carbons (ACs). Besides, kinetics and isotherms assays were performed and modeled in order to monitor the sorption capacities and dynamic behaviors.The main results showed that the raw Turbinaria biomass has a non porous structure. Then, after thermo-chemical treatments, a porous matrix starts to develop and the total pore volume drastically increased from 0.001 cm3/g for the algal precursor (turb-raw) to 1.316 cm3/g for its derived chemically AC (turb-P1). As well, the specific surface area improved from m2/g for (turb-raw) to 1307 m2/g for (turb-P1). Consequently, the maximum sorption capacity went from 63 mg/g for the algal biomass up to 411 mg/g for the chemically ACs.Moreover, the removal rate was taken into consideration in order to set a more reliable and realistic approach to figure out the most efficient AC.Thus, based on those criteria, it was found that the chemically activated carbon “turb-P1” is the most efficient Turbinaria-derived sorbent to adsorb and remove methylene blue (MB) molecules from aqueous solutions with 169 g of the dye using 1 kg of raw alga (considering an AC production yield of 49%).",

Analysis of soluble components, sludge characteristics, microorganism community and metabolic activities in the rCAA system showed that, when the sludge in the aerobic zone flowed into the anaerobic zone, sludge destruction and degradation occurred. Intracellular organic substances were then released and further hydrolyzed to small molecular compounds. These intermediate substances were degraded in subsequent aerobic compartments. In this way, cryptic growth of the sludge was realized that could contribute to sludge reduction. Microbial ecological analysis by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) further showed that the rCAA process spatially domesticated the different microbial communities along the flow direction of the bioreactor, which enhanced excess sludge lysis and transformation, cryptic growth and bacterial predation.",

The ternary phase diagrams, tie-lines, and respective tie-line lengths, were determined at 25 °C. The gathered data allowed the evaluation of the effects of the ionic liquid cation core, of the cation side alkyl chain length, and of the anion nature, to form two-phase systems. It is shown that the ionic liquids aptitude to undergo liquid–liquid demixing is mainly controlled by their hydrophobicity.

An emerging technology for low-cost and rapid-response VLP vaccine manufacture is based on controlled cell-free assembly of capsomeres, which are expressed in Escherichia coli, into VLPs presenting pharmaceutically relevant antigenic modules. A key bioprocessing challenge in this technology is VLP self-assembly, which has until now been studied using qualitative laboratory methods and without sufficient quantitation. In this work, the yield and size distribution of VLPs assembled by dialysis or by ten-fold dilution were compared using quantitative metrics. Membrane-based steps used for dialysis and particle concentration were identified as the key inefficiencies in each method, resulting in 13–18% protein loss. Key inefficiencies were circumvented through process intensification that led to development of a two-fold dilution assembly method. The new process eliminated a unit operation, improved the final concentration of assembly products by a factor of five and reduced buffer consumption nine-fold. Using this process, modular capsomeres presenting a group A Streptococcus (GAS) antigenic module were assembled into high-quality VLPs with a final yield of 54%, which was 18–22 percentage points higher than obtained using conventional methods described in the literature. This study demonstrates the feasibility of manufacturing VLP vaccines in cell-free reactors at high yield, with high structural integrity, using a scalable and simple process. Ongoing development based on these results will be conducive to process-intensified VLP bioprocessing for low-cost vaccine delivery at global scale.",

Basidiomycete laccases decolorized inks without mediators at long reaction times, although the presence of natural or synthetic mediators (above all HBT) accelerated the process. On the other hand, M. thermophila laccase was unable to decolorize the inks assayed. The addition of syringyl-type mediators led to medium levels of decolorization except for R48 ink, which was almost completely decolorized.Most decolorization was obtained during the first hours of treatment, when all the basidiomycete laccases were fully active in the presence of mediators. As opposed to other basidiomycete laccases, which become inactive in the presence of HBT after 24 h, the enzyme of P. coccineus was not deactivated by this mediator even after 48 h.

Hydrophobic groups (methylene and alkane groups) and active groups (CH2CO or CH2NH) contents decreased in the substrates with adsorption of enzymes. The transfer abilities of total protein in the four composting substrates (soil, vegetable leaf, rice straw and chaff) were weakened as the ratio of manganese peroxidase (MnP) to lignin peroxidase (LiP) increased from 4 to 6, and were enhanced when the MnP/LiP ratio increased to 8. The transfer abilities of LiP in the four composting substrates were enhanced continually with the increasing MnP/LiP ratio. The transfer of MnP was similar to that of total protein with the change of MnP/LiP ratio. These results indicated that the change of MnP/LiP ratio could affect the transfer of ligninolytic enzymes in different composting substrates.",

The addition of copper sulfate led to enhancement of the enzyme activity until it reached a maximum value at peak copper sulfate concentration (PC) followed by suppression and even complete termination of the enzyme activity. Maximum laccase yield is a function of fungi tolerance and media composition. Nutrients had a significant impact on copper-independent and copper-induced laccase activity. Some nutrients also improved tolerance of cells and laccase-producing system to copper load. The effect of specific nutrient depended on the ratio of carbon and nitrogen sources. This research can be used to predict the effective copper concentration and nutrient composition to stimulate the laccase production without compromising the fungi growth. The methylated substrates (3-O-methylglucose, methylcellulose) in combination with casein and copper demonstrated high potential to support fungi tolerance and enhanced laccase activity.",

To better understand the bioactive properties of violacein derivatives, deoxyviolacein and oxyviolacein were biosynthesized by genetically engineered strains of Citrobacter freundii(pComvio) and C. freundii(pComvioΔd), respectively, using l-tryptophan or 5-OH-l-tryptophan as the precursor, respectively. The structure of oxyviolacein was confirmed based on HPLC–MS and NMR analysis. Deoxyviolacein and oxyviolacein were evaluated for their effectiveness against bacteria and phytopathogenic fungi. The two pigments exhibited strong activities against all Gram-positive bacteria tested except Streptococcus sp. Oxyviolacein showed a surprisingly high activity against Phytophthora capsici, a devastating pathogen of vegetable crops, and also showed strong antifungal activity against Fusarium oxysporum, Botrytis cinerea, and Verticillium dahliae at 0.5 mg mL−1. Deoxyviolacein showed strong antifungal activity against Rhizoctonia solani at concentrations exceeding 2 mg mL−1. The presence of a hydroxyl group appeared to be essential for their bioactivities. These findings provide important information for the further exploitation of violacein and its derivatives as fungicides.",

Investigation on substrate interactions in the biodegradation of mixed phenols indicated that phenol and m-cresol exhibited a mutual inhibition to each other, and they (only below 300 mg/L) both promoted the 4-CP biodegradation. However, 4-CP strongly inhibited the biodegradation of other phenols in their mixtures despite of the low concentration. Further analysis showed that the newly proposed kinetic model for cell growth on ternary substrates fitted the experimental data very well. And sensitivity analysis suggested that substrate interaction coefficients f i (i = 12, 13 and 23) of the models were the most sensitive parameters.

The four most effective bioleaching variables were selected in accordance with the Plackett–Burman design and were further optimized via central composite design (CCD). The optimal values of the variables for maximum multi-metal bioleaching were as follows: particle size 150–212 μm, sucrose 93.8 g/L, pulp density 3% w/v, and pH 7. The maximum metal recoveries corresponding to these conditions were 99.5 ± 0.4% Mo, 45.8 ± 1.2% Ni, and 13.9 ± 0.1% Al. The relatively low Ni extraction was attributed to the precipitation of Ni in the presence of oxalic acid. Under the optimal conditions, the fungus growth was found to be higher in the presence of spent catalyst than that in the catalyst-free medium. Determinations of the organic acid concentration showed noticeable variation during bioleaching, particularly for gluconic acid. Accordingly, a modified form of shrinking core model was used to take these variations into account. The predictions by the model showed good consistency with the experimental results, suggesting that diffusion of bioleaching agent through the solid matrix was the rate-controlling step.",

A adsorption step at isoelectric pH (≈6) followed by a desorption step at high pH (12–13) causes an overshoot in the breakthrough curves due to lower affinity resin by amino acid under alkaline conditions. Contrarily to this behaviour, the solution that leaves the column reaches a zero concentration of amino acid during a certain time in two consecutive saturations at high pH and isoelectric pH.

The study was performed on two developed AO-MBR systems, namely a P-MBR (practical system) and a C-MBR (control system), run in parallel and continuously fed with real domestic wastewater. In Run 1, in the P-MBR, a part of the mixed liquid (1.5% of the influent flow rate) was disintegrated thermochemically (at 80 °C, pH 11 and 3 h) and was sent back to the bioreactor. During this period, sludge solubilization efficiency was about 20–22%. Sludge production rate of the P-MBR was less than that of the C-MBR about 33%. In Run 2, ferrous sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O) was added into the P-MBR to control the total phosphorus in the effluent less than 1.0 mg/L. It is interesting that the sludge solubilization efficiency in this period was reduced down to 17–19% showing that the thermochemically sludge disintegration process was only slightly affected by the FeSO4·7H2O addition. The reduction of sludge production rate of the P-MBR compared with that of the C-MBR was only 24%. The MLVSS/MLSS ratio was reduced from 75% to 68%. Regardless of the FeSO4·7H2O addition, the TN removal efficiencies were maintained around 62% in both systems. In conclusion, the sludge disintegration plays an important role in reduction of sludge production rate. Although the adding FeSO4·7H2O caused a reduction in sludge production rate, the effluent water qualities and membrane operation were not significant affected during the operation of over 9 months.",

Both bioreactors achieved high removal efficiencies for diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen while partial removal of carbamazepine and diazepam. The configuration of the FBR maintained a steady and feasible operation for 100 days with complete removal of diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen regardless of the aeration system (air or oxygen) and remarkably high removal percentages of carbamazepine and diazepam: 60–90%. The extraction of the target compounds from the biomass and the support showed low residual concentrations of all the compounds both on fungal pellets and on the support of the FBR. Only significant values were detected in the STR with immobilized mycelium, demonstrating partial adsorption. A tentative identification of the degradation products of the three anti-inflammatories was performed, indicating the presence of 4-hydroxy-diclofenac, 1-hydroxy-ibuprofen-, 6-O-desmethyl-naproxen, as the major degradation products of the three parent compounds.",

The resulting fermentation solids were added directly to a bread suspension to generate a hydrolysate containing over 100 g/L glucose and 490 mg/L free amino nitrogen (FAN). A first-order kinetic model was used to describe the effect of initial bread mass ratio on glucose and FAN profiles.

This corresponds to an overall yield of 0.55 g succinic acid per g bread. This is the highest succinic acid yield compared from other food waste-derived media reported to date.

Compared with glucose and refined glycerol, the crude glycerol could obtain significantly higher biomass concentration and lipid yield. The highest biomass concentration of R. toruloides obtained from crude glycerol in a 5 L fermenter reached 26.7 g/L with an intracellular lipid content of 70%. Further study was performed to investigate the individual effect of five representative compounds which were present in crude glycerol as impurities. It was found that within the general concentration ranges, only methanol displayed somewhat inhibitive effect, while others showed positive influence on lipid production. These results indicated that crude glycerol could be directly converted to triacylglycerols by R. toruloides without purification.

The marine bacterium Paracoccus sp. strain N-81106 is one of the natural producers of astaxanthin, but its astaxanthin productivity is too low for economically feasible industrial production. We tried to improve the productivity of astaxanthin by this strain by a combination of (i) random mutagenesis and (ii) gene cloning/overexpression of astaxanthin-biosynthetic genes. In the first step, we isolated astaxanthin-overproducing mutants after random mutagenesis of strain N-81106. The mutants isolated, NG5 and NG9, showed greater production of astaxanthin than did the wild-type strain N-81106. The yield of astaxanthin in the mutants was about 17 times that in strain N-81106. In the second step, we cloned the astaxanthin-biosynthesis genes of strain N-81106 in Escherichia coli by using a broad-host-range vector, and we then mobilized the cloned genes from E. coli to strains N-81106, NG5, and NG9. The recombinant NG5 produced astaxanthin at 58 mg/l—56 times the production of the original strain. The yield was further increased by fed-batch fermentation to reach 480 mg/l culture fluid.",

Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of a biological sample from the BAC filter showed that among the six detected orders, Rhodocyclales- and Burkholderiales-related microorganisms were dominant and Rhodocyclaceae- and Comamonadaceae-related microorganisms may play a role in BrO3− reduction. Two isolated pure cultures, i.e. Sphingomonas sp. 4721 and Deinococcus sp. 4710, exhibited the ability to reduce BrO3− in the presence of NO3−.

     "abstract": "An industrial strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, NRRL Y-132, was genetically engineered to stably secrete barley α-amylase by introducing an expression cassette containing the α-amylase cDNA and a dominant selectable marker into the ribosomal DNA loci of the yeast chromosome. Batch fermentation studies with this strain showed that the integrated expression cassette was mitotically stable for over 100 generations of continuous culture. In addition, mutation of cysteine 95 to alanine in barley α-amylase was found to increase the recombinant strain's starch hydrolyzing ability. The integrated strain showed higher starch hydrolyzing ability and ethanol production on both soluble and raw starch than the strain transformed with an episomal-based yeast expression plasmid. The results indicate that integration of the gene cassette into multiple copy loci should be given consideration when designing amylolytic yeast strains.",

The Reynolds number during the procedure was 4 or 20. The distribution of dextran along the flow direction in the tube was determined colorimetrically and showed that the dextran formed was distributed such that the amounts of dextran were higher near the ends than in the middle section of the tube. Direct observation of the dextran after colorization with phloxine showed that giant dextran particles, up to approximately 20 μm in size, were formed. The distribution of dextran produced by the enzymatic reaction in a laminar flow was determined quantitatively.",

     "abstract": "Typically, models of bacteriophage adsorption consider the process in two steps: reversible and irreversible attachment. In this study, a recently introduced one-step adsorption model, the adsorption efficiency model, is used to describe the adsorption of T-series bacteriophages to Escherichia coli. The adsorption efficiency model simplifies phage attachment to a single step: irreversible binding. The adsorption efficiency (ɛ) is used to account for unadsorbed phages. The model accurately describes T-series phage adsorption (T2, T4, T5, T6, and T7) under a variety of conditions. In addition, the model is compared to a commonly used two-step adsorption model, the sequential model. Experimental data support the assumptions of the adsorption efficiency model and suggest that the reversible first step of T-series phage adsorption is equivalent to irreversible attachment under the conditions tested. The adsorption efficiency model was not appropriate for a phage λ strain lacking side tail fibers. However, the model did agree with data previously published for a strain of phage λ possessing side tail fibers, as is the case of all T-series strains tested. This suggests that the adsorption efficiency model applies to phages containing side tail fibers",

The dual net draft tube bioreactor had higher kLa value (7.3 h−1) than the solid tube bioreactor (5.5 h−1). The fungus was cultured at 25 °C for 12 days, then elicited with chemicals and physical factors. It was found that comparing to calcium chloride, chitosan was a more potent chemical elicitor. At dosage level of 100 mg/L, it not only resulted in more biomass production but also yielded higher crude triterpenoids production. The triterpenoids production could be significantly enhanced by means of the oxygen limitation and temperature fluctuation strategies. The maximum triterpenoids production could be achieved by using static culture (oxygen limitation) with temperature fluctuation between 25 °C (for 10 h) and 10 °C (for 14 h). The in vitro anticancer activity assay indicated that the crude triterpenoids produced by A. cinnamomea using the developed elicited two-stage cultivation protocol effectively inhibited proliferation of human cervical epithelioid carcinoma HeLa cells in a dosage dependent manner. The IC50 of the crude triterpenoids from the mycelium of A. cinnamomea after 21 days cultivation for HeLa cells was 25 μg/mL.",

The open reading frame (ORF) of lipase LC2-8 encodes 311 amino acids with 287 amino acid residues in the mature lipase which shared 96% homology at the amino acid level with the putative lipase LipC from Pseudomonas stutzeri A1501. The optimum pH and temperature for lipase activity were 8.0 and 30 °C, respectively. Its hydrolytic activity was found to be highest towards p-nitrophenyl caproate (C8). Lipase LC2-8 showed high tolerance in the presence of various organic solvents. Most of the hydrophilic solvents tested strikingly enhanced the activity and stability of lipase LC2-8. The half-life of lipase LC2-8 was extended to 10-fold in the presence of isopropanol, acetone, ethanol and methanol. The transesterification resolution of (R, S)-1-phenylethanol by lipase LC2-8 was carried out with the yield of 47.6%, the enantiomeric excess of residual substrate (ees) was 99.9%, giving an E-value over 200.

Cell growth was profuse under the temperature conditions of 37 °C, 40 °C and 45 °C, with cell growth rates, μmax increasing with temperatures. Initial culture pH of 6 displayed the highest PrtL yield of 2.33 U. For each growth temperature the cell growth rates under anaerobic conditions were markedly higher than microaerophilic conditions, attributable to efficient sugar utilization under anaerobic fermentation. Overall, the proteolytic activities of cell-bound PrtL (bPrtL) were found to be higher than that of released PrtL (rPrtL). Higher rPrtL activities were displayed by anaerobic cultures over the entire fermentation period whereas the converse was true for bPrtL with microaerophilic cultures in the mid-late exponential phase displaying higher bPrtL activities than anaerobic cultures. Further, the proteinases had caseinolytic specificity for β-casein and κ-casein placing them in the cell-envelope-associated proteinases (CEPs) class I (CEPI) of the lactococcal CEPs grouping.

A number of Enterobacteriaceae species are able to produce 1,3-PDO from glycerol in stirred tank freely suspended cell bioreactors. Little is known about the use of crude glycerol in the production of 1,3-PDO and about the opportunity to intensify the process via strain immobilization in packed bed bioreactors.In this work, Citrobacter freundii, strain DSM 15979, and Pantoea agglomerans, strain DSM 30077, were tested for their ability to produce 1,3-PDO from crude glycerol in shaken flask batch conditions and in packed bed biofilm reactors operating under continuous conditions. Three different hydraulic retention times (HRT) were comparatively tested (8, 4 and 2 h) in order to understand its effects on 1,3-PDO production under immobilized cell conditions. The study revealed that HRT significantly influenced the process performances. The best productivities were observed when a HRT of 2 h was applied. However, both strains were found to be good candidates for 1,3-PDO production in biofilm reactors, even though P. agglomerans displayed quite higher productivities (3.6 g/(L h)) than the other strain.",

Its success is due to its powerful methanol-inducible alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter, capacity to perform post-translational modifications and pathways leading to recombinant products secretion. Despite its advantages, P. pastoris cultivation is plagued by high protease expression levels, high sensitivity to methanol levels, nutrient-deficiency when grown on defined media, difficulties in systematic study due to product-specific effects, and health and safety concerns associated with the storage of large quantities of methanol. Difficulties also arise that are specific to the cultivation methods and control strategies used.The present review discusses several bioprocess engineering aspects related to P. pastoris cultivation, including the different promoters available, both constitutive and inductive, on- and off-line process parameter monitoring methods, fed-batch and continuous cultivation control strategies, proteolytic degradation of products and methods to minimize associated yield reductions, and the different models devised to describe cell growth and protein production. The economics of P. pastoris cultivation, through a case-study involving recombinant phytase production, are also discussed. The study of yeast fermentation is currently very dynamic, and P. pastoris is on its way towards becoming a standard expression system.",

It also highlights the significance of mathematical model-based approach for designing various bioreactor operating strategies to facilitate the improvement in 1,3-PD production.

After a long period of operation, reactor R1 still performed better than the control, even when the voltage supplied to the electrode was off. Taken together, these results indicate that there was a coupling effect between the electrode reaction and biodegradation. 16S rDNA analysis revealed that anaerobic microorganisms in R1 were richer and more diverse. This increased richness and diversity was partially related to the Fe2+ leaching induced by the electrochemical reaction and increased production of extracellular polymeric substances, which benefited microbial growth and function.",

So herein, the influences of EGCG on the fibrillation kinetics of human insulin at two conditions (pH 2.0, 60 °C and pH 7.4, 37 °C) were extensively studied. It was found that at pH 2.0 and 60 °C the inhibitory effect increased with increasing EGCG concentration from 0.35 to 3.5 mmol/L but kept almost unchanged from 3.5 to 5 mmol/L EGCG. The addition of EGCG reduced the length and width of fibrils and kept part of insulin from fibrillation at this condition. At pH 7.4 and 37 °C, however, EGCG altered the fibrillation pathway of insulin and redirected it into globular aggregates, and the inhibitory effect of EGCG on the aggregation reached maximum at about 0.1–0.2 mmol/L. In this case, part of insulin molecules were prevented from aggregation and existed as a mixture of monomer, dimer, tetramer, and hexamer in the solution. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that EGCG slowed down the changes of the secondary structures of insulin in the aggregation. Finally, two physical models were proposed to explain the molecular interactions between insulin and EGCG at the two conditions.

     "abstract": "The transport of paclitaxel in Taxus suspension cultures was studied with a fluorescence analog of paclitaxel (Flutax-2®) in combination with flow cytometry detection. Experiments were carried out using both isolated protoplasts and aggregated suspension cell cultures. Flutax-2® was shown to be greater than 90% stable in Taxus suspension cultures over the required incubation time (24 h). Unlabeled paclitaxel was shown to inhibit the cellular uptake of Flutax-2®, although structurally similar taxanes such as cephalomannine, baccatin III, and 10-deacetylbaccatin III did not inhibit Flutax-2® uptake. Saturation kinetics of Flutax-2® uptake was demonstrated. These results indicate the presence of a specific transport system for paclitaxel. Suspension cells elicited with methyl jasmonate accumulated 60% more Flutax-2® than unelicited cells, possibly due to an increased cellular storage capacity following methyl jasmonate elicitation. The presence of a specific mechanism for paclitaxel transport is an important first result that will provide the basis of more detailed studies as well as the development of targeted strategies for increased paclitaxel secretion to the extracellular medium.",

The stimulation factors (SF, i.e., activity ratios of the mini-cellulosome to the non-complexed cellulase mixture) were larger on Avicel than on RAC regardless of substrate/enzyme ratios. Also, SF increased when substrate/enzyme ratio increased. The different hydrolysis patterns of the mini-cellulosome and cellulase mixture on Avicel and RAC suggested that the construction of synthetic cellulosomes would be an efficient way to significantly enhance cellulose hydrolysis rate and digestibility, especially in the case of low-accessibility recalcitrant cellulose at low enzyme usage.",

The optimization was successful in batch mode and validated in packed bed column mode. Full automation was achieved by establishing a method to automate pH and salt concentration adjustment on liquid handling stations. Several process optima were identified by the genetic algorithm. It was demonstrated that the initial population design influenced the number of optima found during a genetic algorithm optimization procedure. The mere application of response surface analysis on the experimental results showed that for systems with several optima no distinct statements on parameter dependency are achieved.

The membrane units (cross-flow microfiltration and nanofiltration) and pump contribute about 2% to the total fixed capital cost whereas fermentation unit along with holding tank contribute about 36% to the total fixed capital cost. The two largest cost components were raw material and yeast extract costs contributing about 6% and 87% respectively to the total operating cost. Total product cost stood at 3.15 US $/kg of 80% (w/w) concentrated and 95% pure lactic acid.

The aim was to simulate the fermentation process of glucose for ethanol production using immobilized yeast in a gas–liquid–solid three-phase bioreactor. According to the newly-introduced dimensionless number (ASh number), a fluidized bed bioreactor was divided into several sections in which the three phases of emulsion, wake, and bubble were modeled parallel to each other. In the proposed model, two sub-models, namely, hydrodynamic and chemical reaction sub-models, were integrated to take the governing physical and chemical phenomena into account. Emulsion, wake, and bubble phases were considered as CSTR (continuous stirred-tank reactor), PFR (plug flow reactor), and bypass flow, respectively. Afterwards, mass transfer was taken into account right at the outlet of each section. The simulation results were compared with the experimental data derived from the literature in a wide range of gas velocity, liquid flow rate, biocatalyst particle size, and the concentration of glucose in the feed stream, which showed a great consistency. The simulation approach proposed in this study proved to be applicable in predicting the behavior of industrial three-phase fluidized bed reactors successfully.",

A non-conservative study reveals the no feasibility of the production plant unless the residues are sold (two different and real prices were chosen), providing with an investment recovery in both cases. On the other hand, the estimations from a conservative study, showed the non-viability of the process even if the residues are sold. This is mainly due to the big quantity of bioreactors required by the plant and the oil extraction yield. An alternative process with a complete extraction was also applied, which became viable in a conservative study only if the residues are sold at the highest price.

These problems involve the solutions of transcendental equations that include products of variables and their logarithms. Such equations are solvable by the use of the Lambert W(x) function. Thus, these standard kinetics examples are solved in terms of W(x) to show the applicability of this commonly unknown function to the biochemical community. Hence, this review first of all describes the mathematical definition and properties of the W(x) function and its numerical evaluations, together with analytical approximations, and then it describes the use of the W(x) function in biochemical kinetics. Other applications of the function in various engineering sciences are also cited, although not described.",

The microbial uptake of indium by the resting cells of S. algae was very rapid: 0.1 mol/m3 (11.4 ppm) indium(III) ions were completely collected by bacterial cells within 10 min.

The pre-colonized (4-week colonization) anodes were tested with three areas (2, 10 and 40 cm2) and compared with the MFCs started with clean and sterilized anodes. The power generation of MFCs increased with the anode areas (2–10 cm2), but kept a plateau for the anode area of 40 cm2. The MFCs with the clean anodes had lower power generation (268 mW/m2) than those with the pre-colonized anodes (801 mW/m2) in the first week of operation.

The Pt-based cathodes had higher power generation (330 mW/m2) than those of the Pt-free cathodes (253 mW/m2) at the startup period, but the difference quickly vanished after a few weeks of operation. This study demonstrated that the advantage of the MFCs with the pre-colonized anodes and platinum-based cathodes disappeared after 3–5 weeks of operation due to the thick biofilm growth on anodes and the aerobic biofilm formation on cathodes.

Two different modeling strategies were tested: a cooperative parallel hybrid model and a competitive mixture-of-experts (MOE) structure both joining a mechanistic Donnan-dialytic transport model and a multivariate projection to latent structures (PLS) model. The MOE structure proved to be a better predictive tool since it combines the two hybrid model elements in a mediated network. The PLS model was used to identify the process variables that are responsible for the mechanistic model inaccuracy. The results showed that biocompartment physicochemical data need to be considered in the modeling of the transport of counterions across the membrane, especially in situations in which the target counterion (e.g., perchlorate or nitrate) is metabolically reduced in the biocompartment. By using this strategy, the complex biofilm contribution to the transport was accounted for, without the need of developing mechanistic models built on simplified and/or inaccurate assumptions.",

However, little work has been done on the control of the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of PHB, as a product quality variable that significantly affects its end-use properties and processing characteristics. In this study, batch and fed-batch cultures of Azohydromonas lata, as a PHB host bacterium, are conducted in flasks and in a lab-scale bioreactor, where a number of culture nutritional and operational variables (i.e., medium composition, dissolved oxygen concentration, harvesting time, feeding policy and post-treatment conditions) are examined in a comprehensive way for their effect on the time evolution of the molecular properties of the produced PHB. Under specific nutritional conditions, batch or fed-batch cultivation mode and pulse or continuous nutrients addition policies, a wide range of number and weight average molecular weights of PHB was attained. Moreover, the harvested culture post-treatment conditions were assessed and found to greatly affect the MWD of PHB. Finally, the optimal nutritional and operational (i.e., feeding policy) conditions were established for the maximisation of the intracellular PHB content and productivity. In general, the PHB is efficiently produced in A. lata bacteria with relatively narrow and unimodal MWD, however, under extreme conditions favouring the enzymic or mechanical degradation of PHB, a broad and bimodal MWD can be effected",

     "abstract": "Microorganisms that grow at high temperatures can improve Fe(II) bio-oxidation and thereby its technological applications, such as bioleaching and H2S removal. Conversely, elements present in industrial growth media, such as fluoride, can inhibit bacterial growth and iron bio-oxidation. In this work, the influence of fluoride on the kinetics of ferrous-iron bio-oxidation with Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans was investigated. The effects of fluoride concentrations (0–0.5 mmol L−1) on both iron oxidation and bacterial growth rates were assessed. In addition, the effect of the addition of aluminum, which was intended to complex free fluoride and reduce the concentration of HF through the formation of aluminum–fluoride complexes, was also investigated. The results show that 0.5 mmol L−1 NaF completely inhibited bacterial growth within 60 h. Nevertheless, fluoride toxicity to S. thermosulfidooxidans was minimized by control of the aluminum–fluoride ratio in the system because, at a 2:1 aluminum–fluoride molar ratio, bacterial growth was similar to that observed in the absence of fluoride ions. Despite a slower bacterial growth rate, fluoride concentrations less than the inhibitory concentration increased the Fe(II) oxidation rate. Successful copper bioleaching (80–100%) from fluoride-containing sulfide ores (1% total fluoride) was demonstrated in the presence of aluminum.",

     "abstract": "Biodegradation of 51–745 mg l−1 of phenol by a well-acclimatized strain of Sulfolobus solfataricus, a thermoacidophilic archaeon, was studied in batch experiments at 80 °C and pH 3.2. Phenol inhibited growth and specific degradation rates (μ and qS). Fitting the experimental growth data with the Haldane model gave the following kinetic parameters: μ* = 0.094 h−1, KS = 77.7 mg l−1, Ki = 319.4 mg l−1 (R2 = 0.950). The true μmax, calculated from μ*, was 0.047 h−1. A volumetric degradation rate (Vmax) was calculated by fitting the phenol consumption data with the Gompertz model. The value of Vmax increased with initial phenol concentration (Si) up to 14.4 mg l−1 h−1. The qS values, calculated from Vmax, were fitted with the Haldane equation, yielding qSmax of 0.110 g g−1 h−1. The yield factor (YX/S) depends on Si and reached a maximum of 0.83 g g−1 at Si = 93 mg l−1.S. solfataricus 98/2 displayed low μmax and qSmax but a good tolerance to phenol (fairly high Ki, K ′ i , high YX/S). This ability to grow on and degrade phenol (93 mg l−1 < optimal Si < 175 mg l−1) at high temperature and low pH is unique and may be useful for removing phenol from hot acidic contaminated effluents. Other possible application could lie in the production of the enzymes involved in the key steps of phenol degradation provided the cloning of the enzymes-related genes in fast-growing mesophiles.",

For this purpose, the experimental data of concentrations of substrates and fermented products were utilized in balances of carbon, reduction degree and ATP. S. thermophilus exhibited always quicker growth compared to the other two microorganisms, while the percentage of lactose fermented to lactic acid, that of galactose metabolized, and the levels of diacetyl and acetoin formed strongly depended on the type of co-culture and the presence of inulin. The StLb co-culture led to higher acetoin and lower diacetyl levels compared to StLa, probably because of more reducing conditions or limited acetoin dehydrogenation. Inulin addition to StLa suppressed acetoin accumulation and hindered that of diacetyl, suggesting catabolite repression of α-acetolactate synthase expression in S. thermophilus. Both co-cultures showed the highest ATP requirements for biomass growth and maintenance at the beginning of fermentation, consistently with the high energy demand of enzyme induction during lag phase. Inulin reduced these requirements making biomass synthesis and maintenance less energy-consuming. Only a fraction of galactose was released from lactose, consistently with the galactose-positive phenotype of most dairy strains. The galactose fraction metabolized without inulin was about twice that in its presence, which suggests inhibition of the galactose transport system of S. thermophilus by fructose released from partial inulin hydrolysis.",

The ITC results suggest that the binding stoichiometry is independent of pH, salt concentration and temperature, but increases with the increase of EGCG concentration. The interactions between insulin and EGCG are always enthalpically favorable, indicating that hydrogen bonding is always involved in the binding process. However, with the increase of EGCG concentration, both ΔH and ΔS increase gradually, indicating an enhanced contribution of hydrophobic interaction at the physiological condition. The binding of EGCG to insulin can be promoted by increasing temperature at about 120 mmol/L NaCl and pH values away from insulin's isoelectric point. The CD results indicate that the binding of EGCG slightly changes the secondary structure of insulin. The fluorescence spectra reveal that EGCG binding gives little effect on the polarity of the environments in which tyrosine residues exist and the solvent-accessible hydrophobic surfaces of insulin. The addition of EGCG decreases the hydrodynamic radius of insulin, indicating that EGCG directly binds to the protein",

The olive oil stability, particularly the one from green olives, which was treated by the enzymatic mixture, was observed to increase up to 3.5 h.

For the first time, a single-stream dryer was used with monodisperse milk droplets having solids contents as high as those used in industrial spray dryers (over 40 wt% total solids). With size measurement of droplets and powders, the particle shrinkage was precisely determined. Changes in shrinkage and morphology were observed when varying feed solids contents and drying temperatures. The majority of particles had an inwardly buckled morphology and hollow, inflated particles were produced at higher temperatures due to boiling. Drying was modelled with a numerical simulation using the Reaction Engineering Approach (REA), which is a semi-empirical model of moisture removal rate. This model accurately predicted the moisture contents of the powders collected. Several sub-models were used for particle shrinkage. The most accurate shrinkage assumption was found to be isotropic shrinkage from the removal of water (known as perfect shrinkage). This may suggest that the surface crust (initially spherical) is viscoelastic and deforms in response to drying stresses.",

The solubility and extent of protein denaturation were characterized using focused beam reflectance measurement and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Due to the controlled drying conditions and well-defined properties of the particles, a direct relationship between spray drying temperatures and the resultant particle functionality could be identified. The particle morphologies obtained from lower inlet air temperature appeared spherical whereas the one from higher inlet air temperature appeared deflated. The FBRM results indicated that the solubility of MPC particles deteriorated with increasing inlet air temperature with increasing protein denaturation. SDS-PAGE results suggested that the insoluble material were primarily casein rather than heat sensitive whey protein.

The results indicated that the modified DO-Stat soybean oil feeding strategy, namely, the method of adopting DO-Stat for soybean oil feeding and using O2-enriched air for aeration, could maintain CPC synthesis rate at an appropriately high level and reduce deacetoxycephalosporin (DAOC, the major by-product of CPC fermentation) accumulation simultaneously. The modified DO-Stat soybean oil feeding strategy could raise final CPC concentration up to a high level of 35.77 g/L and lower DAOC concentration down to a level of 0.178 g/L, so that the quality standard of CPC fermentation product could be satisfied by controlling DAOC/CPC ratio below 0.5%.

     "abstract": "The CHO cell line is mainly used to synthesize recombinant proteins for human therapeutic use. Recent efforts have focused on improving the productivity of this system by mainly using two tools: genetic manipulation of the cells and/or changing the operating conditions of the cultures. In most cases, these techniques have resulted in significant improvements to the productivity of the system. For example, a slight decrease in culture temperature has been used over the past ten years to increase culture longevity, resulting in an increased productivity of r-proteins. However, despite large numbers of diverse studies, there are currently no unified hypotheses to explain the increased productivity of r-proteins. This is mainly because the magnitude of this effect is dependent on the cell line and the r-protein, and the effects of temperature on cellular processes of protein synthesis and cell growth are difficult to decouple and quantify experimentally.In this review, we assembled the most relevant backgrounds to address this problem, and we explore a different experimental approach that allowed us to decouple specific cell growth from culture temperature, in order to estimate the net effect of temperature on the productivity of r-proteins and to better understand the molecular and cellular processes involved. The information provided in this study can be used to propose new strategies at an industrial scale for implementing fed-batch or perfusion cultures to improve the production of several important r-proteins.",

The time profile for the inflow of the nutrient medium, g(t), is a logistic model which takes the form of g(t) = a/(1 + be−ct), with a, b and c standing for its parameters. The initial values of a, b and c were calculated considering the results of a baker's yeast process where dissolved oxygen tension was used as a control parameter of medium inflow. A method was developed for modifying the parameters of the initial model so as to obtain a formula that would cause the inflow of the nutrient medium to maximize the criterion K(K = Yμ), where Y stands for yeast biomass yield and μ denotes specific growth rate. The parameters of the modified model depended on initial biomass concentration. The relation was described by a logarithmic function and incorporated into the control algorithm. This algorithm produced a biomass yield exceeding 0.55 g g−1 and a high dough-leavening ability. The method proposed is recommendable for small and medium-sized firms producing baker's yeast.",

     "abstract": "Biotrickling filters (BTFs) devoted to air pollution control often present mass transfer limitations for hydrophobic volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Under such limiting conditions, BTF design and scale-up should be based on mass transfer data. A general and simple model was developed to characterize the VOC transfer by means of the overall mass transfer coefficient (KLa). The KLa values were obtained by fitting the model to experimental data of toluene absorption obtained at empty bed residence times (EBRT) from 7 to 50 s. The model fitted well the experimental data (r2 = 0.97) and the resulting KLa values ranged from 35 to 113 h−1. These values are similar to those reported in the literature for BTF despite the lower liquid recycling velocity here used (0.6 m h−1). A critical gas-to-liquid flow rate ratio (QG/QL) of 200, above which KLa was poorly increased, was observed. In addition, the individual film coefficients were estimated from the Van Krevelen and Hoftijzer correlations, which revealed that the main resistance for toluene mass transfer was in the liquid film regardless of the EBRT used. Finally, the high mass transfer potential of BTFs was confirmed by estimating the mass transfer capacity under varied operating conditions.",

However, it is difficult to release from their precursor proteins that are orally administered. Based on the selectivity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) on C-terminal dipeptides in its substrate, six pentapeptides with the same tripeptide IKP (as a model) at N-terminus including IKPVQ, IKPVA, IKPVK, IKPVR, IKPFR, and IKPHL were designed and chemically synthesized. It was shown that all the pentapeptides released IKP after ACE incubation. The release rate ranged from 23% (IKPHL) to 84.6% (IKPVR) as compared to the peptide sample before incubation. The in vitro digestion experiment demonstrated that all of the pentapeptides except IKPVA with a retention rate of 80.5% were resistant to pepsin hydrolysis but not to pancreatic hydrolysis. It should be noted that IKP could be released from IKPFR by pancreatin digestion. These results suggest that IKPVA and IKPFR potentially have a great antihypertensive effect in vivo. Furthermore, the dipeptides VA and FR described here may be widely used as linkers to help the release of the active peptides with proline at C-terminus from their protein precursors by ACE or gastrointestinal enzymes in human body.",

However, the liver functions of hepatoma cells are generally low compared with those of hepatocytes in a liver. Here, we attempted to create genetically engineered hepatoma cells with enhanced liver functions by overexpression of liver-enriched transcription factors (LETFs), which are associated with the transcription of liver-specific genes and hepatic differentiation. For this purpose, genes for eight LETFs, hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1α, HNF-1β, HNF-3β, HNF-4α, HNF-6, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)-α, C/EBP-β and C/EBP-γ, were obtained from the mouse liver. Mouse hepatoma Hepa1-6 cells were transduced with retroviral vectors, in which inducible expression cassettes for the LETF genes were introduced. Cell clones with inducible expression of high liver functions were established. Upon overexpression of the LETF genes, cell proliferation ceased and the cells exhibited an epithelial morphology, indicating hepatic maturation of hepatoma cells. This approach for genetic modification of hepatoma cells may be promising for the construction of cells for use in bioartificial liver support systems.",

Catalase was present in all reactions to remove the hydrogen peroxide that evolves in the reaction, to prevent its reaction with an α-keto acid, and potential negative influence on amino acid oxidases. Batch reactor experiments without and with aeration were carried out with the two enzymes. Michaelis constants for oxygen were estimated from the initial reaction rate experiments and were found to be 0.030 and 0.053 mM for l-AAO from C. adamanteus and C. atrox, respectively. It was found that aeration increases the reaction rate and decreases the time necessary to achieve 100% l-methionine conversion due to the increase of oxygen concentration in the solution. It was also found that the increase of the air flow rate causes faster enzyme operational stability decay rate. The operational stability decay rate constant for C. adamanteus enzyme was estimated to be 6.29 x 10−4 min−1 in the experiment without aeration. It increased in the experiment with aeration at 10 L h−1 to 3.75 × 10−4 min−1, and was practically the same at higher air flow rate. Experiments without l-methionine presence proved that oxygen concentration was the reason for the decrease in enzyme activity for this enzyme and not the gas bubbles itself. In these experiments operational stability decay rate constants were one order of magnitude higher than when l-methionine was oxidized. It was found for l-amino acid oxidase from C. atrox that the operational stability decay rate constant linearly depends on the air flow rate. This dependence can be described by the following equation: kd = 3.1 × 10−4 × qv + 3.4 × 10−4 min−1.

In addition, using waste animal fat as a feedstock is considered a waste management process. In this work, an integrated process for a continuous fat extraction from lamb meat followed by enzymatic production of biodiesel in supercritical CO2 has been developed and tested. The system simultaneously produces two valuable products, namely biodiesel and healthy low-fat lean lamb meat (HLFLM). For the enzymatic process to be feasible, lipase is preferred to be used in immobilized form, which allows easy reuse. The continuous system was operated at 200 bar and a SC-CO2 flow of 0.5 ml min−1, with extraction and transesterification temperatures of 45 °C and 50 °C, respectively. The effects of methanol:fat (M:F) molar ratio and enzyme stability were investigated.

One of the most important applications of sugarcane juice is in the production of ethanol biofuel. A correct design of unit operations during the sugarcane juice processing requires an accurate characterization of the flow properties (friction factors, rheological behaviour, thermophysical properties and heat transfer coefficients) of this raw material. In this work, friction factors (f) and Nusselt number (Nu) were determined for sugarcane juice in different steps of its processing (untreated sugarcane juice, clarified sugarcane juice and mixed sugarcane juice). For both laminar and turbulent flows, the empirical models for f fitted well (r2 ≥ 0.9) with the experimental values obtained by pressure drop measurements. Also, Nu values calculated by applying the empirical correlation of Hausen (for laminar flow) and that of Sieder–Tate (for turbulent flow) presented good adjustment (r2 ≥ 0.9) to the experimentally determined values. Thus, the f and Nu values obtained for turbulent flow were taken to verify the Colburn analogy, which furnished results with small deviations (≤8.9%) from the expected ideal value. This finding indicates the suitability of such analogy in this case, allowing good estimations of heat transfer coefficients from frictions factors, or vice versa, for sugarcane juices in turbulent flow conditions.",

     "abstract": "The moss Physcomitrella patens is a promising expression system for the production of recombinant human biopharmaceuticals. Highly standardized cultivation conditions are required to maintain the desired chloronemal level of cell differentiation during cultivation. Although the life cycle of P. patens is well known and described in literature only little is known about morphology development in closed photo bioreactors (PBR). In the current work we describe the relationship between light intensity and development of moss-morphology in a stirred draft tube PBR during cultivation: pellet formation occurred for high initial photon flux densities (PFD). The application of a low initial PFD followed by subsequent increase could prevent the moss culture from forming dense pellets and the filamentous morphology could be preserved. A high bio dry mass (BDM) of 3–4.5 g L−1 could be achieved as well as high specific chlorophyll content of the filaments. Pellet formation is discussed on basis of particle size distributions and data obtained from image analysis. Adjusting the level of illumination is a non-invasive method to maintain the filamentous morphology of P. patens and thus homogeneity of the medium because cells do not need to be disrupted mechanically.",

Surface tension measurements showed that the rhamnolipid product reduces surface tension more effectively than frothers due to higher molecular weight and the presence of multiple oxygenated groups in its structure, producing more viscous liquid film, which was confirmed with film elasticity calculations. Both surface tension and elasticity values followed the order: rhamnolipid > A-65 > DF-250 > pine oil > MIBC.

The alpha-factors of aeration were determined at three different mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS) concentrations, in order to understand the system performance when pure oxygen was used to provide the aerobic conditions of the MBR system. Under these working conditions, an alpha-factor in the range 0.90–0.12 was obtained when the HRT of 18 h was performed, and the MLSS concentration increased from 4300 to 10,275 mg/L. Additionally, an alpha-factor in the range of 0.28–0.02 was obtained at HRT of 12 h and the MLSS increased from 4071 to 11,192 mg/L. Our study suggested significant changes in the behaviour of the biological system (viscosity, aeration efficiency, organic matter removal) when the concentration of MLSS was increased and the HRT decreased in the bioreactor, decreasing the aeration efficiency in both cases. Furthermore, the efficiency of aeration seems to be more affected by MLSS concentration than by HRT under our operating conditions over the range studied.",

The performances of MFCs before and after anode modification were compared, confirming that all these anode modifications posed positive effects. The maximum power density of the MFC with the anode modified by nitric acid was 792 mW/m2, which was 43% larger than the unmodified control (552 mW/m2). Furthermore, the Coulombic efficiency (CE) significantly promoted about 71% from 14% (the unmodified MFC) to 24%. It revealed that the electrochemical oxidation resulted in the change of the anode properties, such as surface morphology, internal resistance and anode potential, and thus benefited to the microbial attachment and electron transfer on the anode surface, which might contribute to the performance improvement of the MFCs.",

It involves the biological conversion of glycerol to succinic acid, a top added-value material, which can be used as a building block for the production of various commodity and specialty chemicals. Our aim is to give new insights into this bioprocess, which has so far received little attention and is open for further investigation, through a combination of experimental and computational studies. The microorganism employed here was Actinobacillus succinogenes in batch bioreactors where glycerol was used as the sole carbon source.The highest obtained product yield, final succinate concentration and productivity were found to be equal to 1.23 g-succinate/g-glycerol, 29.3 g-succinate/L and 0.27 g-succinate/L/h, respectively. Furthermore, an unstructured model of the batch experiments was developed by considering both substrate and product inhibition. Kinetic parameters of the model were estimated by minimising the difference between experimental and predicted values. The corresponding optimisation problem was solved by using a combination of stochastic and deterministic methodologies, with the goal to probabilistically compute global minima and the resulting parameter values. The model developed can be utilised to successfully predict the concentration profiles of the five most important state variables (biomass, glycerol, succinic acid, formic acid, and acetic acid) with different initial glycerol concentrations. Scaled-up experiments in larger-scale bioreactors were used for further validation purposes. Our model can be further used to compute optimal operating/parametric conditions, which maximise yield, productivity and/or the final succinic acid concentration.",

Parameters obtained from respirometry were compared to those obtained by the chemostat method, based on substrate and biomass measurements, under several dilution rates. The low sensitivity of substrate measurement methods and the difficulties of sampling heterogeneous biomass suspension are critical issues limiting the applicability of the chemostat method. Additionally, the extensive time consuming nature of this method allows concluding that chemostat method presents several disadvantages in comparison with in situ pulse respirometric techniques. Parameters were obtained from respirograms by fitting ASM1 and ASM3 models, and from experiments performed by injecting pulses of increasing substrate concentration. The injection of pulses of increasing concentration was the most adequate method, with several advantages such as a simpler experimental data interpretation, and results with better confidence.Considering the assessment and comparison of the experimental and calculation methods presented, it is recommended that the estimation of kinetic and stoichiometric parameters in mixed aerobic cultures should preferentially be performed by using in situ respirometric techniques.",

The efficiency of pAcF incorporation was further improved by coupling five copies of the T-stem mutant suppressor tRNA gene omitted the 3′ terminal CCA with two constitutive copies of the D286R mutant aaRS gene in a single-plasmid construct. To assay the utility of the optimized system, we incorporated pAcF in response to three independent amber nonsense codons (Lys21TAG, Phe170TAG, Lys248TAG) into uricase. Under optimized expression conditions, 24 mg/L mutant uricase was produced, corresponding to 40% of the yield of wild-type uricase (UOXWT). The desired specificity for incorporation of pAcF into uricase was confirmed. Kinetic measurements and spectroscopic study performed by CD did not show any relevant differences in the substrate affinity, the catalytic activity and protein secondary structure between native and mutant uricase. Additionally, the mutant uricase was site-specifically modified with methoxy-PEG-oxyamine (mPEG5K-ONH2). This efficient system provides reactive handles for a rational PEGylation to manipulate uricase structure and function and will be beneficial for enhancing the incorporation of other unnatural amino acids into proteins.",

     "abstract": "This work investigated the modification of aggregate properties during the formation of granular sludge in a sequencing batch airlift reactor (SBAR). The cohesion of biological aggregates was quantified by subjecting sludge samples to two different controlled shear stresses in a stirred reactor. For reference sludge (without granules), flocs broke and reformed easily, indicating that floc size was controlled by the turbulence micro-scale (Kolmogorov scale, here from 17 μm to 62 μm). In contrast, granules showed high strength which enabled them to resist turbulence and their size was no longer imposed by the Kolmogorov micro-scale. Different steps were observed during the granulation process: a first increase of aggregate cohesion associated with a decrease in sludge volume index (SVI), a growth of aggregates with detachment of fragile particles from the surface and, finally, an increase in the sizes of small and large granules to reach a pseudo-stable size distribution. Results suggest that small particles could have formed the seeds for new granules, as they were maintained in the bioreactor. Here, granular sludge was formed in an SBAR with a conventional settling time (30 min), i.e. without particle washout, and with a low superficial air velocity (SAV = 0.6 cm s−1): it is thus demonstrated that high SAV and low settling time are not necessary to produce granules, but probably only accelerate the accumulation of granules. It is shown that the increase of cohesion is the initial phenomenon explaining the granule formation concomitantly with bacterial aggregates densification. It seems important, in the future, to investigate the reasons for this cohesion increase, which is possibly explained either by bacterial bounding interactions or the excretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS).",

Randomly packed sulfur and limestone granules (S + L) media were used as the control. Results revealed that SCr is the most suitable media as it exhibited the highest nitrate removals and lowest nitrite accumulation. It has macrovoidal pores which facilitated microbial attachment. Additionally, SCr had the highest CaCO3 loading per unit volume and highest media dissolution rate which was favorable to avert pH decrease. But due to high denitrification activity, high sulfate levels in SCr may necessitate a post-treatment step prior to effluent discharge. Due to poor biomass attachment, S + L is most sensitive to change in fluid flow condition. As hydraulic retention time is decreased, S + L exhibited intensive and irreversible performance decline. Inferior denitrification performance of SCa was mainly due to low CaCO3 loading per unit volume, low dissolution kinetics and low alkalinity consumption by denitrifiers. Using modified Stover–Kincannon kinetic model, overall performance and denitrification capacities can be arranged as SCr > S + L > SCa.",

The corn stover medium contained 3% ground corn stover and 3.5% corn flour but the control medium contained 5% corn flour without corn stover. All of the other components were same in the two media. Decomposition rates of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in the corn stover substrate were 20.9%, 17.9%, and 19.8% through 288 h of submerged cultivation. Lignocellulose decomposition in the corn stover-containing medium yielded significantly higher EPC (118.9/135.7 mg GAE (gallic acid equivalents)) and IPC (21.2/23.7 mg GAE) than in the control medium (34.7/42.5 mg GAE of EPC and 12.5/13.5 mg GAE of IPC) per liter of culture broth (EPC) and per gram of mycelia (IPC) in shake flask cultures/10 L fermenter runs. Both EPC and IPC from the corn stover medium showed a higher scavenging activity against hydroxyl radicals and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals than those from the control medium during the later fermentation period. In dose-dependent experiments, EPC from the corn stover medium at 216 h demonstrated a significantly stronger free radical scavenger activity against DPPH and hydroxyl radicals, shown as much lower IC50 values, than that from the control medium and IPC from the two media.",

     "abstract": "A novel deep-bed solid-state bioreactor was designed and fabricated for cellulolytic enzymes production using mixed fungal cultures. Better temperature and moisture control was achieved through a unique bioreactor design comprising an outer wire-mesh frame with internal air distribution along with near-saturation conditions within the cabinet. Without airflow through the internal distributors, maximum temperatures of 48 °C and 52 °C were observed during half- and full-capacity operation. These were reduced to 44 °C and 43 °C on resumption of airflow. In terms of cellulolytic enzyme production, no significant differences occurred in filter paper activity with depth in half-capacity operation; however, in full-capacity operation, top-level filter paper activity (5.39 FPU/g-solids) was significantly different from middle- and bottom-level activity. Top level beta-glucosidase, endocellulase, and xylanase activities were significantly (P < 0.05) different from middle and bottom levels in both half- and full-capacity operation. A two-phase coupled heat and mass transfer model was developed that predicted the experimental trends reasonably well. Model predictions confirmed that cabinet temperature of 30 °C and distributor airflow rate of 3.42 kg h−1 during operation enabled effective temperature control.",

The addition of anion-exchange resins reduced acetate accumulation in the culture, which in turn, improved growth of E. coli and enhanced PrIFN-α2b expression. The presence of anion-exchange resins did not influence the physiology of the cells. The weak base anion-exchange resins, which have higher affinity towards acetate, yielded higher PrIFN-α2b expression as compared to strong anion-exchange resins. High concentrations of anion-exchange resin showed inhibitory effect towards growth of E. coli as well as the expression of PrIFN-α2b.

The data sets for the various combinations of the excitation and emission spectra from batch cultivations were analyzed using principal component analysis. Chemometric models (the partial least squares method) were developed for correlating the fluorescence data and the experimentally measured variables such as the biomass and glucose concentrations as well as the carbon dioxide production rate. Excellent correlations were obtained for these variables for the calibration cultivations. The predictability of these models was further tested in batch and fed-batch cultivations. The batch cultivations were well predicted by the PLS models for biomass, glucose concentrations and carbon dioxide production rate (RMSEPs were respectively 5%, 7%, 9%). However, when tested for biomass concentrations in fed-batch cultivations (with final biomass three times higher than the highest calibration data) the models had good predictability at high growth rates (RMSEPs were 3% and 4%, respectively for uninduced and induced fed-batch cultivations), which was as good as for the batch cultivations used for developing the models (RMSEPs were 3% and 5%, respectively for uninduced and induced batch cultivations). The fed-batch cultivations performed at low growth rates exhibited much higher fluorescence for fluorophores such as flavin and NAD(P)H as compared to fed-batch cultivations at high growth rate. Therefore, the PLS models tended to over-predict the biomass concentrations at low growth rates. Obviously the cells changed their concentration of biogenic fluorophores depending on the growth rate. Although multi-wavelength fluorescence spectroscopy is a valuable tool for on-line monitoring of bioprocess, care must be taken to re-calibrate the PLS models at different growth rates to improve the accuracy of predictions.",

At all storage temperatures, trehalose was found to be retaining the highest relative cell viability than other cryoprotectants. In addition, alginate–chitosan capsules were produced to encapsulate E. faecium with the aim of enhancing survival of probiotic cells and keeping the probiotic during exposure to the harsh gastro-intestinal conditions. Encapsulation of probiotic into alginate–chitosan capsules found to be retaining higher survival of probiotic cells (4.342 ± 0.26 Log CFU mL−1) at −20 °C for six months.

By continuously feeding glycerol, NH4Cl, and l-tryptophan at a constant feeding rate of 16 mL h−1, the final concentration of violacein reached 4.13 g L−1, which was 4.09-fold higher than the corresponding batch culture, and the maximal dry cell weight (DCW) and average violacein productivity obtained for the fed-batch culture were 3.34 g DCW L−1 and 82.6 mg L−1 h−1, respectively. To date, this is the first report on the efficient production of violacein by genetically engineered strains in a fermentor.",

ECU1011 esterase (PsE) in the kinetic resolution of (R,S)-2-acetoxyphenylacetic acid (APA) was significantly improved by substrate modification, biocatalyst permeabilization and immobilization. The reaction system was modified, and the sodium salt of the substrate (APA Na), instead of APA, was hydrolyzed in aqueous phase without buffer. Considering the improved substrate solubility and the decreased biocatalyst inactivation, the reaction rate increased 3.7-folds and the spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate reduced by 48%. During the cell permeabilization, the hydrolytic activity of the whole-cell biocatalyst was increased by 2.3-fold after 2 h of pretreatment with 10% (v/v) toluene. The permeabilized cells were further entrapped in calcium alginate, resulting in 171% activity recovery with a half-life of 123 h at 30 °C. Using the modified reaction system with high reaction rates and the modified biocatalyst with high activity and stability, this biocatalytic process can be transformed into a practical and environmentally friendly bioprocess for the efficient production of (S)-mandelic acid and (S)-o-chloromandelic acid.",

The mechanism of Tween-80 effect was investigated from three aspects: protecting free cellulase from deactivation, decreasing cellulase proteins adsorption and reducing the cellulase deactivation during the interaction between enzyme and substrate. Tween-80 did not show more positive effects at high speed in protecting free cellulase against deactivation and decreasing cellulase proteins adsorption.

The results indicated that T. versicolor displayed the greatest decolorization ability, both in terms of extent and rapidity. To assess the potential of T. versicolor, decolorization tests were performed in single and repeated batches in an air-pulsed bioreactor with biomass reuse.

The biochemical parameters associated to acetate degradation kinetics were the maximal acetate uptake rate (kmXac) and the half-saturation constant K S ac . After calibration, the value of kmXac was 440 mgCOD kg−1 d−1 and K S ac was 290 mgCOD kg−1 for a moisture content (MC) of 82%.

     "abstract": "Laccase mediator systems are important bioremediation agents as the rate of reactions could be enhanced in the presence of the mediators. In the present study commercial laccase was used for the biotransformation of malachite green (MG), a cationic dye in the presence of phenolic compounds of groundnut shells and lignin-related synthetic redox mediators. The addition of ethanolic phenolic extract of groundnut shell enhanced the decolorization of MG from 38.73 to 87.32%. All the selected natural phenolic compounds enhanced the decolorization of MG like synthetic mediator 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Characterization of MG transformation products by UV–vis and HPLC analyses revealed that N-demethylation was the key mechanism of decolorization of MG by laccase alone as well as in the presence some of redox mediators. But in case of MG decolorization with laccase mediated system by groundnut shell extract and other natural compounds, leuco-malachite green was the major transformed product. Growth inhibition test based on mycelial growth inhibition of white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium (ATCC 1556) revealed that treatment with laccase plus natural and synthetic mediators effectively reduced the growth inhibitory levels of MG than that of control. Thus, the study revealed that the natural phenolic compounds could be used as potential redox mediators for enhanced laccase-mediated decolorization of malachite-green dye.",

For reducing the excess sludge, heat and alkaline treatment was reported as a feasible process. To develop a biosurfactant from treated sludge, the surface activity of heat–alkaline treated sludge was investigated in this study. Sludge, Escherichia coli, and extracted E. coli lipids were treated under pH 7, pH 11 and pH 13 conditions that were then combined with or without heat treatment. When the sludge was treated at pH 13 and then heat-treated for 18 h, the surface tension of the supernatant of the treated sludge was reduced by 26.6% from 72.5 mN/m to 53.0 mN/m. As a whole, the alkaline treatment more effectively reduced surface tension than heat treatment because the surface tension of the supernatant was lower than 55.4 mN/m after the sludge was treated at pH 13. N-hexadecane droplets were emulsified by the supernatant of treated sludge, and then collected using a designed sampling device. The droplet size distribution and cumulative frequency curve of n-hexadecane droplets showed that over half of the droplets were smaller than 80 μm after they were emulsified by supernatant from alkaline-treated sludge at pH 13 treatment condition no matter with or without heat treatment. These findings indicate that heat–alkaline treated sludge has both surface activity and emulsifying capability.",

Operating parameters, including hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic tanks, solids retention time (SRT) and internal recirculation ratio were subjected to optimization using SVR and AGA. The simulation results were normalized and SVR was employed to correlate the operating factors and the effluent quality. Then, the AGA approach was used to obtain the optimal operating conditions. The multiple-objective optimization with different weights indexes was adopted to achieve simultaneous nutrient removal. Compared with the present operating conditions, the HRT of the anoxic tank, the internal recirculation ratio and the SRT should be reduced, while the HRT of the aerobic tank should be prolonged to achieve better effluent quality.

     "abstract": "In the recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the development of hybrid reactors, especially in the up-grading of existing activated sludge plants that are no longer able to comply with concentration limits established by regulatory agencies. In such systems the biomass grows both as suspended flocs and as biofilm. In this way, it is possible to obtain a higher biomass concentration in the reactor, but without any significant increase of the load to the final clarifier. The paper presents the setting-up of a dynamic mathematical model aimed at quantitatively describing the biokinetic processes occurring in a hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor (HMBBR), and, more in general, in integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) processes, as well as to compare the simulation results with measured data from a HMBBR pilot plant built at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim (Norway). Particularly, the pilot plant consisted of three aerobic tanks in series; the first and third aerobic reactors were pure suspended biomass systems, while the second aerobic reactor was filled with the AnoxKaldnes™ K1 carriers for biofilm development. The mathematical model consists of two connected models for the simulation of both suspended biomass and biofilm. Biochemical conversions are evaluated according to the well known matrix notation used in the Activated Sludge Model No. 1 (ASM1) for both attached and suspended biomass and, in addition to biochemical conversion, the model contains the simulation of particulate detachment from the biofilm into the bulk liquid. The results showed an overall good agreement between measured and simulated data, for both biofilm and suspended biomass, with a good reproduction of dynamic processes in the hybrid moving bed pilot plant, and they are encouraging for further developments.",

This strain was isolated from a petroleum contaminated soil and it produces a mixture of rhamnolipids. The nutritional and environmental conditions necessary for optimal production of rhamnolipid, attachment of rhamnolipid and formation of thicker biofilm on the polypropylene surface were found to be different from one another. Comparatively lower pH and temperature, higher concentration of ammonium chloride and rotation velocity of the shaker were required for the biofilm formation and the attachment of rhamnolipid on the polypropylene surface. Screening design showed that the extent of viable cells and rhamnolipid attached to the polypropylene surface was positively correlated (r = 0.474; p < 0.01). However, central composite design did not show any such relationship, possibly because of the different experimental ranges used in central composite design. There were considerable variations in the thickness and spatial arrangement of biofilms grown under these three different optimized conditions. Higher substratum coverage and thicker biofilm were observed under the condition optimized for biofilm formation when compared to the other two conditions. This study is essential since P. aeruginosa biofilms are found to have implication in bioremediation of recalcitrant pollutants.",

The effects of nutrient deprivation and exposure to high phenol concentrations on the activity of P. putida were also evaluated. The experimental results indicated that the immobilized bacteria remained active for a period of 72 h, even without the addition of nutrients. Subsequently the activity gradually decreased, but the bacteria easily regained their original activity with the addition of nutrients. Sudden exposure to high phenol concentrations resulted in immediate decline in the biodegradation activity, but the bacteria adapted to the new concentrations and regained their activity within 24 h.

Cloud points were determined in McIlvane buffer pH 6.5 with or without NaCl, and diagram phases/coexistence curves were constructed. CA partition was investigated following a 24-full factorial design in which AOT (0.022, 0.033 and 0.044% w/w), Triton X-114 (1.0, 3.0 and 5.0% w/w) and NaCl (0, 2.85 and 5.70% w/w) concentrations and temperature (24, 26 and 28 °C) were selected as independent variables, and CA partition coefficient (KCA) and yield in the top phase (ηCA) as responses. CA partitioned always to the top, micelle-poor phase. The regression analysis pointed out that NaCl concentration and interaction between temperature and Triton X-114 concentration had statistically significant effects on KCA, while ηCA was mainly influenced by temperature, Triton X-114 concentration and their interaction. Different ATPMS compositions were then needed to maximize these responses, specifically 0.022% (w/w) AOT, 5% (w/w) Triton X-114 for KCA (2.08), and 0.044% (w/w) AOT, 1% (w/w) Triton X-114 for ηCA (98.7%), both at 24 °C without NaCl. Since at 0.022% (w/w) AOT, 1% (w/w) Triton X-114 and 28 °C without NaCl the system was able to ensure satisfactory intermediate results (KCA = 1.48; ηCA = 86.3%), these conditions were selected as the best ones.

Herein, we use design of experiments methodology to quantitatively define and optimize in vitro erythropoiesis from human cord blood CD34+ cells to enucleation. DOE was used to theoretically define the effects of 7 cytokines known to affect red cell maturation in humans. Of these, stem cell factor (SCF) and erythropoietin (EPO) were found to be the most significant factors in red cell production (p < 0.01). DOE defined process characteristics and interactions of SCF and EPO on total cell expansion and maturation of cord blood HCs towards the erythroid lineage and delineated optimal in vitro concentrations of each cytokine (75 ng/mL and 4.5 IU/mL, respectively). The DOE-optimized cytokine cocktail achieved an average of 26,460-fold total cell expansion and accelerated erythroid maturation yielding over 90% glycophorin-A-expressing cells by day 7. Maturation of red cells was confirmed by morphology, immunophenotype, clonogenic capacity, gene and protein expression of adult and neonatal hemoglobins (α, β, and γ) and by progressive expression of GATA-1 with maturation. The use of DOE was effective and efficient for the analysis, characterization and optimization of in vitro erythropoiesis to the stage of enucleation and provides a systematic platform for the use of other growth factors in vitro for the study of hematopoiesis and expansion of cell products.",

In this study, the disulfide form of a small peptide mimic of protein disulfide isomerase, CGC, was explored to facilitate oxidative protein refolding with residual dithiothreitol (DTT) as the reductant. Working with DTT, CGC gave higher yield and folding rate than oxidized glutathione. Then, a new pentapeptide, RKCGC disulfide, was designed. It was found that RKCGC was more effective than CGC in increasing the folding rate and final yield, as demonstrated in the oxidative refolding of lysozyme and ribonuclease A. It was because the pentapeptide has lower pKa and higher reduction potential than CGC. Moreover, it efficiently facilitated protein refolding not only at neutral pH but also in a weak alkaline buffer. With CGC or RKCGC as the oxidant, the DTT removal step and the addition of other thiol reductants were not needed. This would benefit in decreasing the processing time and cost in protein refolding processes. This design has thus provided more efficient oxidant, and it may pave the way for the design of more effective thiol-disulfide redox agents.",

     "abstract": "3-Hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) has a great potential in the pharmaceutical-, food-, and chemical industry as a potent antimicrobial compound and chemical precursor. Until now it is not commercially available, occurring only as intermediate in production of petro-derived 1,3-propanediol. In this study, we developed a new method for 3-HPA isolation, biotechnologically produced by Lactobacillus reuteri. A composition of an Amberlite anion exchange resin and hydrogensulfite (IRA-SO3H) was generated to extract 3-HPA from the complex mixture of the production medium. 3-HPA was successfully recovered and concentrated in a pure form. Using this approach, IRA-SO3H was evaluated to bind 3-HPA throughout the bioconversion. The IRA-SO3H successfully bound already produced 3-HPA without decreasing L. reuteri viability. However, new 3-HPA formation was repressed. To conclude, our data showed for the first time the selective extraction of 3-HPA from the bioconversion medium and its subsequent recovery. Future work is needed to adapt this system to an in situ product removal process not interfering with the bioconversion.",

Horseradish peroxidase–streptavidin (HRP–SA) conjugate and laccase–streptavidin (LAC–SA) conjugate were applied for enzyme-amplified amperometric measurement. The two target genes were simultaneously quantified in the same system. The DNA conformation and surface coverage on electrode were characterized by impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The amperometric current responses to HRP and LAC-catalyzed reactions were linearly related to the common logarithm of two target nucleic acids concentrations, ranging from 1 × 10−11 M to 4 × 10−8 M and 1 × 10−10 M to 4 × 10−8 M. The correlation coefficients were 0.9884 and 0.9881, and the detection limits were 6.2 × 10−12 M and 3.0 × 10−11 M, respectively. The effectiveness of this DNA sensor was confirmed by simultaneous detection of two gene fragments extracted from Phanerochaete chrysosporium using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction endonuclease digestion.

Chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total suspended solids (TSS) removal ratios were measured as indicators of the system performance. Experimental results clearly indicate that MLSS and OLR are the crucial parameters in thermophilic aerobic treatment. Optimal COD, BOD and TSS removals up to 86%, 87% and 89%, respectively, were achieved with MLSS concentration and OLR of 27,000 mg/L and 2.5 g COD/(L day), respectively. More significantly, high MLSS concentration range which is yet to be reported was successfully applied and this has resulted in superior performance as compared to other thermophilic treatment studies. No significant improvement of the treatment efficiency was attained with DO concentration exceeding 5 mg/L and settling time up to 24 h. Hence, operation at DO concentration of 2 mg/L and settling time of 2 h gives a good compromise between effluent quality and system operating costs.",

Effects of modification conditions on the particles hydrophobic character, lipase adsorption and acidolysis activity were investigated. Modified particles were bigger and more hydrophobic than unmodified ones. The most active biocatalyst achieved a change in the composition of palmitic and stearic acid from a value of 9.6% in the original oil to 49.1% in the final structured lipids, representing an almost 3-fold enzyme hyperactivation. This high conversion was maintained during 7 reuse cycles (168 total hours). The results demonstrated that the chitosan modification was effective in order to adsorb and hyperactivate RM lipases.",

At pH of 7.1–7.4 and a sludge retention time (SRT) of greater than 100 days, a laboratory-scale intermittently aerated sequencing batch reactor (IA-SBR) was operated at about 20 °C to treat synthetic wastewater containing readily biodegradable COD of 100–300 mg L−1 and ammonium–nitrogen (NH4+–N) of 300 mg L−1. During the aeration periods, DO concentrations were controlled at less than 0.2 mg L−1, and the aeration was terminated when on-line NH4+–N measurement reached 20 mg L−1. During 180 days of operation, the mass ratio of nitrite–N (NO2−–N) to the total oxidized nitrogen was over 90% in the effluent. Molecular analyses show that ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) represented up to 10% of the total bacterial population in the sludge biomass, and the ratio of AOB to nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) was generally over 100. The IA-SBR quickly recovered after non-operation for 47 days. The three main factors enabling long-term stable partial nitrification in this study were: enrichment of AOB in the start-up period; controlled oxygen-limited conditions and the intermittent aeration strategy.",

Small amplitude oscillatory shear tests were conducted to illustrate the rheological response under non-destructive conditions. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed the occurrence of a dispersion of gel-like domains in a continuous phase. Rheological methods were used to check that the samples characterised were free of thermo-mechanical history effects prior starting the transient flow tests. Start-up shear flow experiments at 10 s−1 resulted in a nearly instantaneous sharp rise of viscosity until a peak value was reached before it dropped following a sum of two first-order kinetic equations. The kinetic coefficients as well as the relative fall in viscosity were found to increase with gellan concentration. The equilibrium modulus as well as the peak and steady-state viscosities scaled with the gellan concentration following a power law equation with a characteristic exponent of about 2.0. Conversely, the degree of thixotropic recovery after a rest time of 10 s went down as gellan concentration increased, emphasising the need to balance both effects when formulating gellan fluid gels as stabilisers. The results obtained do a better job of highlighting the importance of peak viscosity than steady-state viscosity when data for pump selection and calculation are required.",

Measurement of oxygen uptake rates during batch experiments confirmed that increasing influent ammonium concentration (161 mg N/L) decreased nitrite oxidizing activity of the biomass to almost zero. Furthermore, real-time PCR assays revealed that increasing influent ammonium concentration led to a decrease not of Nitrobacter but Nitrospira in the submerged membrane bioreactor.

The substrate interactions observed in mixed-substrate experiments could not be accurately described by models without directly specifying the type of interaction even when accounting for enzymatic interactions. The structure of the genetic circuit–growth kinetic model was validated with batch cultures of mt-2 fed with m-xylene and succinate and its predictive capability was confirmed by successfully predicting independent sets of experimental data. Our combined genetic circuit–growth kinetic modelling approach exemplifies the critical importance of the molecular interactions of key genetic circuits in predicting unusual growth patterns.

In this paper we explored the potential for using in situ pulse respirometry in a submerged fixed-bed reactor for assessing biological processes. A nitrifying fixed-bed reactor was operated over 85 days while analyzing the dissolved oxygen response to pulses of ammonium. In situ pulse respirometry allowed us to determine the apparent maximum oxygen uptake rate and substrate affinity constant. Additionally, the apparent biomass growth yield was determined during the first 60 days. Unfortunately, after day 60, erratic biomass growth yield results were obtained, which we were unable to explain through hydrodynamic characterization of the reactor. However, it is concluded that in situ pulse respirometry is a potentially useful tool to characterize fixed-bed reactors as an alternative to other methods, such as mass balance.",

     "abstract": "The dynamics of microbial stress response in intensive cultivation conditions remains not completely understood. In this work, two green fluorescent protein (GFP) transcriptional reporters have been used as biosensors of the heterogeneities generated in a two-compartment scale-down reactor. The stress promoters have been chosen for their responsiveness to carbon limitation corresponding to the global substrate profiles encountered in intensive fed-batch cultures. From our results, it can be concluded that the exposure of microbial cells to substrates heterogeneities tends to decrease the GFP expression level in fed-batch mode. Fluorescence intensities have been monitored at the single cell level by using flow cytometry. During the course of the fed-batch culture, a drop at the level of the intracellular GFP content has been observed for the two scale-down operating conditions and for the two promoters sensitive to substrate limitation (rpoS and csiE). The fluorescence drop can be attributed to the repression of these promoters but also to the release of GFP to the extracellular medium according to the increase of the fluorescence level of the supernatant. This leakage has been observed for all the operating conditions, i.e. the scale-down reactors and the culture operating in the normal mode, i.e. in a well-mixed bioreactor. Interestingly, GFP leakage is more pronounced in the case of the cultures operated in the normal mode. Indeed, staining by propidium iodide tends to be more elevated for the microbial cells cultured under the normal mode by comparison with those cultured in scale-down conditions, indicating a higher permeability of the membrane. These results suggest that GFP microbial biosensors could be used to detect simultaneously mixing imperfections and their impact on the viability of microorganisms.",

     "abstract": "The feasibility of enzymatic production of biodiesel from waste animal fats using supercritical fluid technology for the extraction and reaction has been investigated. The operating conditions that resulted in the optimum extraction and biodiesel production yields were identified. The effects of extraction temperature, pressure and supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) flow rate were investigated in the ranges of 35–55 °C, 300–500 bar and of 3–5 ml min−1, respectively, and optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). In addition, the effects of reaction temperature, methanol:fat molar ratio and enzyme loading on biodiesel production yield were investigated in the ranges of 35–60 °C, 3:1–6:1 and 10–50%, respectively. The optimum conditions for supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) were determined to be 45 °C, 500 bar and 3 ml min−1; at which, 87.4% of total fat content was extracted from freeze dried meat. The statistical analysis however, showed that pressure has negligible effect on the extraction yield, which is extremely important, as it allows saving energy by using lower pressure. On the other hand, biodiesel yield of 40% was obtained using extracted fat as feedstock in SC-CO2 medium at 50 °C, 200 bar, 4:1 methanol:fat molar ratio and 30% loading of lipase enzyme, after 24 h of reaction. The experimental results were used to fit a suitable reaction kinetic model using non-linear regression analysis to estimate the model parameters.",

     "abstract": "Displacement chromatography is a powerful technique for protein purification, but the availability of high-efficacy displacers has greatly limited its applications. In this work, a displacer-immobilized ligand docking scheme was developed for the prediction of displacer efficacy and displacer screening for displacement chromatography of proteins. The structure of immobilized ligand was established by coupling a certain number of ligands to the 3D structure of agarose. A number of known cation, anion and hydrophobic displacers were docked to their respective immobilized ligands to verify the effectiveness of the scheme, and the Spearman ranking correlation coefficients of all cases were over 0.5. The scheme was then used to screen displacers for hydrophobic charge induction chromatography from over 1800 commercially available compounds. Column displacement experiments of several representative compounds showed that the identified displacers were efficacious in the displacement of single component and binary mixtures. It is expected that the combination of the docking scheme with the existing techniques for displacer discovery/design would greatly facilitate the discovery of high-affinity displacers for protein purification.",

     "abstract": "In this paper a mathematical model is presented to describe poly(β-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) formation and consumption in Ralstonia eutropha. The model is based on the hybrid cybernetic modeling approach, which was introduced by Kim et al. [1] and which allows a systematic derivation of the model equations from elementary mode analysis. An extension of this approach is presented to allow for non quasi-stationary metabolites, i.e. PHB. The model is shown to be in good agreement with experimental data for PHB formation and consumption. The model is used afterwards to discuss the occurrence of multiple steady states in a continuous bio reactor. It is shown that the multiplicity region predicted by the model is rather small and it is argued that multiple steady states are therefore unlikely to occur in practice for this specific system.Due to various desirable features such as accounting for cellular regulation at network level and dynamics of intracellular metabolites with a moderate complexity, it is believed that the constructed model is most suitable for control, optimization and monitoring of industrial PHB production processes.",

     "abstract": "From the viewpoint of process engineering in enzymatic biodiesel production, this paper provides a practical basis for development of the packed-bed reactor (PBR) on a bench scale. A key component of this work is the separation of glycerol byproduct in continuous operation. To facilitate measuring and separating the byproduct, we constructed the PBR integrated with a glycerol-separating system. Methyl ester content in the effluent increased with increasing pass number of the reaction mixture, whereas the efficiency of glycerol removal was affected significantly by the flow rate in PBR. Further optimization revealed that the PBR could be operated over a long period realizing both a high methyl ester content and an efficient glycerol removal, obtaining a product that meets the biodiesel standard for residual glycerides. To remove soluble glycerol present in the biodiesel, adsorptive purification using ion-exchange resin was applied to the PBR system. The initial glycerol content of approximately 0.053 wt% was reduced to less than 0.003 wt%, which was maintained for more than 140 bed volumes and repeated after regeneration of the resin using methanol. Therefore, this developed model incorporating the enzymatic PBR and glycerol-separating system is promising for practical biodiesel production, in which no wastewater treatment is necessary.",

Batch fermentations were carried out at low-intensity sonication (11.8 W cm−2 sonication intensity at the sonotrode tip) using 10%, 20% and 40% duty cycles. (A duty cycle of 10%, for example, was equivalent to sonication for 1 s followed by a rest period (no sonication) of 10 s.) Fermentations were carried out in a 7.5 L (3 L working volume) stirred bioreactor. The sonotrode was mounted in an external chamber and the fermentation broth was continuously recirculated between the bioreactor and the sonication chamber. The flow rate through the sonication loop was 0.2 L min−1. All duty cycles tested improved ethanol production relative to control (no sonication). A 20% duty cycle appeared to be optimal. With this cycle, a final ethanol concentration of 5.20 ± 0.68 g L−1 was obtained, or nearly 3.5-fold that of the control fermentation. Sonication at 10% and 20% cycles appeared to stimulate yeast growth compared to the control fermentation, but 40% duty cycle had a measureable adverse impact on cell growth. Sonication at 10% and 20% cycles enhanced both the extracellular and the intracellular levels of β-galactosidase enzyme. Although at the highest duty cycle sonication reduced cell growth, cell viability remained at ≥70% during most of the fermentation. Sonication at a controlled temperature can be used to substantially enhance productivity of bioethanol fermentations.",

     "abstract": "Coenzyme limitation is one of the most important issues for 1,3-propanediol (PDO) production. Elementary mode analysis indicated that pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle were the most efficient pathways for generating reducing equivalent NADPH and NADH. Under the optimal condition for PDO production, 0.542 mol NADPH/(mol glycerol), accounting for 61.7% of the total reducing equivalent would be produced, which requires the fast conversion of NADPH for PDO synthesis. Based on the above analysis, an endogenous NADPH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (HOR) was cloned and overexpressed for NADPH usage in Klebsiella pneumoniae ACCC10082. The activities of HOR and total 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase (PDOR) increased 5.8-fold and 1.1-fold than that of the wild type strain. In the fed-batch fermentation, the PDO concentration and yield of the constructed strain increased 10.4% and 9.4% while the highest 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde accumulation reduced 35.1% compared with that of the wild type strain. Metabolic flux analysis suggested that the increase of PDO yield was due to the enhanced carbon flux flowed to pentose phosphate pathway which provided coenzyme for HOR utilization. This work is helpful for the further understanding of PDO metabolism in K. pneumoniae and also useful for the strain improvement of PDO production.",

In the cultivation of recombinant Escherichia coli, the cells expressed high green florescence after the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) as the inducer. By simply holding the cell pellets in Tris–HCl (pH 10.0) buffer at room temperature, EGFP was solubilized from the INP–INT segment embedded on the cell surface via intein's self-cleavage function. The EGFP concentration of 273 mg/L and recovery of 88% were obtained at day 5, whereas the best EGFP productivity of 187 mg/L/d was obtained at day 1.

     "abstract": "In solid-state fermentation systems, the growth of aerial hyphae into the interparticle spaces increases the pressure drop through forcefully aerated beds. Aerial hyphae can also bind particles into agglomerates, restricting the transfer of O2 to the particle surfaces. Despite these important effects, to date relatively little effort has been made to understand the growth patterns of these hyphae. In the current work we present a discrete lattice-based model that can be used to simulate the growth of the aerial hyphae of filamentous fungi. In the model, the elongation of hyphae involves the successive addition of 10 μm cubes, with random numbers being used to choose the direction of growth. The model was able to describe profiles available in the literature for the density of the aerial hyphae, as a function of height above the surface, for a situation in which the filamentous fungus Rhizopus oligosporus was grown on potato dextrose agar. The model can be modified to describe various different situations involving the growth of filamentous fungi in solid-state fermentation systems, such as the growth of penetrative hyphae and the growth of hyphae within the wet mycelial layer that often forms at the surfaces of particles. It therefore represents a useful tool for investigating phenomena that occur at the micro-scale in solid-state fermentation systems.",

Enhanced aeration caused changes of the morphology of microorganism from aggregates with large projected area to aggregates with small projected area.

The oxidative stress in B. trispora resulted in a significant increase in carotene production. The highest concentration of carotenes (55.0 ± 2.5 mg/g dry biomass) was obtained at aeration rate of 4 vvm. Very high oxidative stress in B. trispora caused a change in the biosynthesis of carotenes resulting an increase in γ-carotene concentration. The maximum proportion of β-carotene (91.68%), γ-carotene (44.67%), and lycopene (11.54% of total carotenes) was observed at aeration rates of 4, 5, and 5 vvm, respectively.

In order to clarify the relationship between sludge reduction efficiency and both chemical and biological modifications, the effects of thermal treatment on activated sludge were investigated by combining the monitoring of cell lysis using flow cytometry (FCM), organic matter solubilization, floc structure and biodegradability. For the maximal temperature (95 °C) applied, COD, proteins, HLS and sugars solubilization degrees reached 12.4 (±1.3)%, 18.6 (±1.8)%, 9.6 (±1)% and 7.4 (±1.9)%, respectively, showing clearly the transfer of organic matter from the particulate to the soluble fraction of the sludge. The results from FCM analysis showed that thermal treatment induces a progressive cell lysis when increasing temperature from 50 to 95 °C. However, the impact on floc structure seemed to be limited as floc destructuration was limited to the temperature elevation at 50 °C. Above 50 °C floc size distribution remained almost constant. The results from biodegradability tests did not show any improvement of the intrinsic biodegradability after the thermal treatment. Only the increase of the specific digestion rate was observed. This study which provides a complete investigation of chemical, physical and biological effects of thermal treatment allows a better knowledge of fundamental mechanisms involved during heat treatment to improve sludge reduction processes.",

Average growth yields over the batch were 3.5 g(dry wt.) mol(S4O6)−1, somewhat less than yields reported for continuous growth on the same substrate. Thiosulfate was unstable under sterile culture conditions and reacted spontaneously to give tetra-, penta- and hexathionate. It is suggested that the occurrence of polythionates during growth of A. caldus on tetrathionate is due to formation of thiosulfate as the first step in tetrathionate oxidation. Observed growth yields were compared with a thermodynamic framework which suggested a growth efficiency of ca. 10%.

Extrusion pretreatment of PCG showed significant improvement on sugar recovery (63.5%). However, there is still room to improve sugar recovery from PCG by combining with alkali soaking. The current study was undertaken to investigate the influence of alkali (NaOH) concentration on sugar recovery and optimize extruder barrel temperature, screw speed, and particle size for maximum sugar recovery. In order to evaluate the sequential effect of alkali soaking and extrusion, PCG (2–10 mm) was soaked at different alkali concentrations (0.5–2.5%, w/v NaOH) for 30 min at room temperature and then extruded using a lab scale single screw extruder at various barrel temperatures (45–225 °C) and screw speeds (20–200 rpm).

The sequenced 18 N-terminal amino acid showed a high degree of identity with known staphylococcal lipase sequences.The gene encoding the mature lipase was cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence showed a significant similarity with various staphylococcal lipases. The highest overall identity (98.74%) was found with S. xylosus lipase (SXL1). The mature part of the lipase was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant lipase was purified by affinity chromatography. The specific activity of the recombinant lipase was 4100 or 1500 U/mg using tributyrin or olive oil emulsion as substrate, respectively, at pH 8.5 and 55 °C.The wild type and recombinant lipases presented a quite interesting thermal stability, after an incubation of 60 min at 55 °C and they are found to be highly stable at a pH ranging from 4 to 11. Due to its stability at high temperature and in organic solvent, the wt-SXL2 was used as biocatalyst to synthesise a high added value molecules.",

We investigate the effects of salt concentration, tissue grinding time and lowering pH on recovery and purification of a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype O6ad) from transgenic tobacco plants. The presence of 450 mM sodium chloride in the extraction buffer resulted in an 8-fold increase in antibody recovery when compared to using a sodium chloride-free buffer. The grinding time and the pH at which the extract was maintained were also found to have significant effects on antibody recovery. Generally, monoclonal antibody recovery could be enhanced by minimizing its interactions with native tobacco proteins and other components of the tobacco tissue. The overall yield of monoclonal antibody after optimization of the grinding and extraction steps was 30.3 mg/kg of tobacco tissue, this being 12.5 times higher than that at a non-optimized extraction condition.",

Starting from polyglycerol and polyricinoleic acid, Rhizopus arrhizus lipase was used as catalyst. The reaction, which is really a reversal of hydrolysis, takes place in the presence of a very limited amount of aqueous phase. No organic solvent is necessary to solubilise the substrates, which allows a reaction medium solely composed of the necessary substrates to be used.Immobilisation of the lipase by physical adsorption onto an anion exchange resin provided good results in terms of activity, enzyme stability and the reuse of immobilised derivative. Using this immobilised derivative, PGPR with an acid value of 16 mg KOH/g was obtained, far above the requirements of the European Commission Directive 2008/84/EC (<6 mg KOH/g). In an attempt to force the reaction equilibrium towards the synthetic pathway, polyglycerol polyricinoleate was synthesised under controlled atmosphere in a vacuum reactor with dry nitrogen intake. This equipment allowed us to synthesise PGPR with an acid value of 4.9 mg KOH/g, which complies with the European Commission Directive and the results were entirely reproducible. This investigation represents a good starting point for using the enzymatic procedure in the industrial biosynthesis of PGPR.",

Some differences were found between the two extracts. The specificity against triacylglycerol esters and p-nitrophenol substrates was also analyzed. Similar behaviour was noted towards triacylglycerol esters; however rROL showed opposite behaviour compared to nROL towards p-nitrophenol esters with preferences for long chain derivatives.The properties of rROL were partially different from those reported for nROL showing the influence of the pre-pro-sequence of ROL, the post-translational modifications of Pichia pastoris and the effect of an esterase in nROL powder.",

The functional groups of DZH were analyzed by FTIR and Au(III) recovery onto DZH was verified by FESEM–EDX and XRD analysis. Adsorption equilibrium isotherms and kinetics of the DZH were studied using Freundlich and Langmuir models, as well as pseudo first-order, second-order kinetic and intraparticle diffusion equations. The experimental data obtained with DZH fitted best to the Langmuir isotherm model and exhibited a maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) of 1724 μmol g−1. The data followed the pseudo second-order equation. The activation energy of the adsorption (Ea) was estimated to be 38.5 kJ mol−1. Thermodynamic parameters, such as changes in enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy, showed that the adsorption is exothermic, spontaneous at low temperature, and is a chemisorption process. These results indicate that DZH adsorbs efficiently and could be used as a low-cost alternative for the adsorption of Au(III) in wastewater treatment.",

     "abstract": "A novel foam fractionation design has been developed for continuously recovering extracellular biosurfactants from fermenters. The apparatus design allows for the operating conditions of the foam fractionation process, feed rate and airflow rate, to be chosen independently of the fermentation parameters. Optimal conditions can then be established for each process, such as the aeration rate required to meet the biological oxygen demand of the cell population. The recirculating foam fractionation process was tested on fed batch fermentations producing the hydrophobin protein HFBII. It is shown that by using foam fractionation to strip HFBII from fermentation broth in situ the amount of uncontrolled overflow from the fermenter was greatly reduced from 770 g to 44.8 g, compared to previous fermentations without foam fractionation. Through optimisation of the foam column operating conditions the proportion of dry matter retained in the fermenter was increased from 88% to 95%, in contrast to dry matter retention of 66% for fermentation without the new design. With the integrated foam fractionation process an HFBII recovery of 70% was achieved at an enrichment of 6.6. This study demonstrates the utility of integrated foam fractionation in minimising uncontrolled foaming in fermenters whilst recovering an enriched product.",

Under non-denaturing conditions, the Langmuir–Freundlich isotherm model was found ideal for predicting the adsorption behavior of the model proteins. The dissociation constants, as low as 10−9 M, decreased with the number of poly(His) tags, suggesting the presence of multi-point attachment. The maximum adsorption capacities, ranging from 79.1 nmol/g for the 88 kDa epimerase to 42.8 nmol/g for the 320 kDa racemase, were inversely proportional to the contact surface areas of the proteins. Under denaturing conditions, the Langmuir isotherm model fitted well with the experimental data. The maximum adsorption capacities for and the dissociation constants of the three model proteins were essentially identical, as the subunits of the model proteins were of similar dimensions and behaved similarly in the absence of complex tertiary or quaternary structure. Phosphate buffer at a concentration of 500 mM, pH 8.0 was found to be effective for the elution of the model proteins with a recovery yield more than twofold higher than that obtained with 500 mM imidazole. The results suggest the hydroxyapatite-based adsorbent is a promising alternative for large scale applications.",

The Cu-OMS-2 exhibited the highest power density (201 mW/m2) at the COD of 1000 mg/L.

LVs are most commonly produced via the transient transfection of several plasmid constructs in adherent cell cultures. Recently, we described an efficient and scalable LV production in serum-free suspension cultures. To further facilitate the translation of LV-based interventions to the clinic, the robustness of the production process needs to be ensured to ultimately achieve a specified quality and quantity of LV production lots. However, routine processes are largely empirical, and strategies to monitor LV production kinetics in real-time have not yet been described.In this work, in situ real-time permittivity measurements were assessed to document the production of LVs. Characteristic process phases that were closely associated with LV production kinetics were identified. The permittivity signal evolution was interpreted by exploiting various independent online and offline monitoring measurements. Cellular membrane properties and, to a lesser extent, cell size were the main factors contributing to the permittivity variations. It is concluded that the permittivity-related parameters can be used for the detection of viral release, allowing real-time assessment of process performance. The technology should thus greatly facilitate process development and optimization.",

By co-feeding methanol and 5-hexenoic acid (C6), functionalized PHAs (4 ≤ chain length ≤ 6) containing C–C double bonds were created. Bioreactor studies revealed negative impacts of 5-hexenoic acid on biomass and PHA production by reducing overall yields. In contrast, there was a positive relationship between 5-hexenoic acid supply and abundance of polymeric functional groups, i.e., molar portions of monomeric units bearing double bonds increased with increased 5-hexenoic acid supply. Correlation of C6 consumption to methanol addition resulted in a model that allowed for on-line estimation of toxic co-substrate concentration. The functionalized PHAs were ductile and showed signs of side chain crosslinking, resulting in reduced degrees of crystallinity. Incorporation of 3-hydroxyhex-5-enoate and 3-hydroxyhexanoate into the polymeric chains produced desirable thermal properties with enhanced thermal stability and reduced melting temperatures (139–168 °C). Thermal degradation and melting temperatures obtained suggest a comfortable range for melt-processing of these polymers and allow for autoclaving as convenient sterilization process. Consequently, functionalized PHAs produced in this study are candidates for medical applications as part of biocomposite materials. The use of methanol as main substrate for cultivation of recombinant M. extorquens offers the possibility to reduce production costs and develop new process control strategies.",

When the phenol concentration in the reactor reaches 2 mM, the cells in fermentations without phenol removal are inhibited in growth and phenol production. Growth and phenol production stop after approximately 80 h at a phenol concentration in the reactor of 3.8 mM. When phenol is removed from the fermentation broth by pertraction, a lower maximum aqueous phenol concentration of 2.6 mM is achieved, while the total phenol production increases to 132%, as compared to the fermentation without pertraction. There are indications that the volumetric productivity (mmol L−1 h−1) increases slightly in the fermentations with in situ pertraction compared to the reference experiments. As expected, the amount of phenol produced per gram biomass (the specific productivity, mmol g−1 L−1) remains constant in time for all fermentations.

     "abstract": "We describe the soluble production of a mouse anti-bovine ribonuclease A single-chain variable fragment (scFv) fused with the Fc region of human IgG1 in Escherichia coli. Two production systems, secretory production using a pelB signal peptide and cytoplasmic production in a trxB/gor double mutant strain with an oxidizing cytoplasm, were investigated for efficient production of soluble and functional scFv-Fc fusion protein. Antigen-binding activity was observed in both systems but almost all of the scFv-Fc that was expressed formed insoluble aggregates. Hence, the co-expression of molecular chaperones was examined. Co-expression of GroEL/GroES showed a 4.6-fold increase in antigen-binding activity in the cytoplasmic production system but not in the secretory system. By contrast, the other two chaperones, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE and trigger factor, had no effect in either production system. The protein solubility was also improved markedly by the co-expression of GroEL/GroES and approximately 70% of the 3A21 scFv-Fc protein was soluble. A practical productivity of more than 10 mg/L was achieved with a simple batch shake-flask culture. These results indicate that the E. coli cytoplasmic production system with oxidizing cytoplasm and molecular chaperones might be one of the choices for the soluble production of scFv-Fcs and other Fc fusion proteins.",

     "abstract": "The sugarcane juice is a relatively low-cost agricultural resource, abundant in South Asia, Central America and Brazil, with vast applications in producing ethanol biofuel. In that way, a good knowledge of the rheological properties of this raw material is of crucial importance when designing and optimizing unit operations involved in its processing. In this work, the rheological behavior of untreated (USCJ, 17.9 °Brix), clarified (CSCJ, 18.2 °Brix) and mixed (MSCJ, 18.0 °Brix) sugarcane juices was studied at the temperature range from 277 K to 373 K, using a cone-and-plate viscometer. These fluids were found to present a Newtonian behavior and their flow curves were well-fitted by the viscosity Newtonian model. Viscosity values lied within the range 5.0 × 10−3 Pa s to 0.04 × 10−3 Pa s in the considered temperature interval. The dependence of the viscosity on the temperature was also successfully modeled through an Arrhenius-type equation. In addition to the dynamic viscosity, experimental values of pressure loss in tube flow were used to calculate friction factors. The good agreement between predicted and measured values confirmed the reliability of the proposed equations for describing the flow behavior of the clarified and untreated sugarcane juices.",

They were separately determined by the dynamic methods. The endogenous oxygen uptake rate of the activated sludge was estimated by monitoring the dissolved oxygen concentration change after turning off the air sparging in a stirred tank. The volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient in a dense activated sludge slurry bubble column was determined using the dissolved oxygen concentration profiles and the oxygen uptake rates predetermined from the separate measurements. While the oxygen uptake rate almost linearly increased with increasing the activated sludge concentration, the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient decreased with an increase in the activated sludge concentration. Their empirical correlations were obtained as functions of activated sludge concentration by fitting the experimental data.For the aerobic biodegradation of p-nitrophenol (PNP) by acclimated waste activated sludge, the dynamic models for the dissolved oxygen mass balance and PNP degradation kinetics with the proposed correlations for volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient and oxygen uptake rate could successfully simulate the concentration profiles of dissolved oxygen and PNP during the time course of an aerobic biodegradation of PNP.",

The initial specific methane production rate was fitted with the Monod type equation in order to calculate the kinetic parameters. The values obtained for the maximum specific methane production rate were 0.043, 0.143 and 0.052 gCH4 gVSI−1 d−1 for each experimental condition, aforementioned. The substantial increment of this parameter at thermophilic condition shows the differences in the specific maximum growth rate between thermophilic and mesophilic populations. The affinity constant values were 3.842, 4.790 and 4.623 g L−1 for each experimental condition; however, a significant uncertainty was obtained due to some identification problems. A preliminary validation of the procedure was applied for predicting the operation of a continuous digester treating raw sewage sludge.

In pure culture systems in industry and laboratory, most of these metabolic pathways are not active. We therefore, investigated for the first time in a bioreactor, the effect of introducing a live culture of another species to the Streptomyces coelicolor cultures that produce antibiotics such as undecylprodigiosin and actinorhodin. Recently, undecylprodigiosin has also been attributed with antitumor activities. Pure cultures of S. coelicolor produced higher concentrations of actinorhodin compared with undecylprodigiosin in a defined medium in a 2 L bioreactor. Elicitation by live cells of Escherichia coli altered this production pattern such that undecylprodigiosin production was enhanced and actinorhodin repressed. E. coli elicitor with a concentration of 1 × 107 cells mL−1 was added at 2.5% (v/v) so that it did not overtake the growth of S. coelicolor. Since the timing of elicitation is also important, we tested E. coli addition at the beginning, on the second and the fourth day of the start of S. coelicolor cultivation. Day zero elicitation gave the maximum enhancement of undecylprodigiosin production which was 3.5 mg L−1 compared with 0.58 mg L−1 in the pure culture.",

     "abstract": "After analyzing protein surface structure, the opposite side of the activity site of esterase BioH was observed to be hydrophilic. Hence subsequently, a hydrophilic-modified solid support was selected to immobilize enzyme through oriented adsorption. The immobilized enzyme remained 86% of its original activity under the acylation of 1-phenylethanol, much more than those immobilized on other solid supports with low hydrophilicity (20–35.6%), as the mode of the immobilization could facilitate enzyme to expose its active site to the substrate. This demonstrated that the strategy to select solid support based on the analysis of protein surface structure was successful. It was also noticed that the substrate of the reaction was obviously adsorbed onto the support, therefore the adsorption effect could not be ignored and it was necessary to obtain the adsorption isotherm of the substrate for a more authentic result. The parameter Km shifted from 884.56 to 296.09 mM after immobilization. This was possibly mainly caused by the increment of substrate concentration around the enzyme due to the substrate adsorbing on the support. It could be another explanation for why those parameters were changed after enzyme immobilization in addition to some existing proposed reasons such as stabilizing conformation, facilitating dispersion of enzyme, etc.",

In the present work, two elicitors (SA and JA) and adsorbents (HP2MGL) were introduced into the Vitis vinifera cell suspension culture, and the results indicated that they could work synergistically to improve the production of trans-resveratrol (2666.7 mg L−1).

Purification of the products by several chromatographic steps was reported, and the 13C labeling position was verified using 13C NMR. Our results indicated that, in this case, the rate limiting step of production was the post-biosynthetic events rather than the biosynthesis in elicited culture. Furthermore, our results suggested the importance of simultaneous optimization of biosynthetic pathways of metabolites and their post-biosynthetic steps toward achieving commercial plant cell culture.

From our study, we found that protein extracted from press cake proteins had a solubility of about 90% above pH 9. Emulsifying properties of press cake protein were comparable to sodium caseinates and reached the highest value at pH 9–10. Jatropha proteins formed films with tensile strength of 0.4–1.8 MPa with 10–75% elongation, which were below soy protein or wheat-gluten. Further oil removal from press cake decreased emulsifying properties, while increased foaming and adhesive properties of the extracted proteins. Protein extracted from de-oiled press cake showed better foaming properties than sodium caseinate at pH 10, but lower than egg white protein at all pH. Furthermore, press cake protein showed better adhesive properties than casein adhesives at the same dry matter content.

Extraction by an aqueous two-phase system is a powerful technique for separation, concentration, and purification of biomolecules and pharmaceutical products. Four factors (PEG's molar mass, PEG's concentration, pH, citrate concentration) affecting the lectin ConGF partitioning were studied. A two-level factorial design (24) was carried out. Lectin ConGF preferentially partitioned to the top (polyethylene glycol) phase. The statistical analysis showed that the citrate concentration chloride significantly affects the KL (partitioning coefficient for protein) value for lectin partitioning. An ATPS composed of 20% (w/w) PEG 400 and 20% (w/w) citrate, at pH 6, allowed the recovery of lectin ConGF with an 8.67 partition coefficient and 104% yield. Consequently, the system proved to be efficient and can be used as a first step in lectin purification from crude extract of ConGF seeds.",

Current developments in the fields of tissue engineering and microtechnology make it possible to propose the use of microfluidic bioreactors as a tool for enhanced in vitro investigations. However, both the cells’ behavior in complex environments and their response to chemicals need to be better understood, especially for future validation of any new assay. To characterize the sensitivity of this approach, we investigated the behavior of a liver cell model with respect to variations of two cell culture parameters in a microfluidic bioreactor: inoculated cell density (0.35 × 106, 0.45 × 106 and 0.65 × 106 cells/bioreactor) and microfluidic flow rates (0, 10 and 25 μL/min). We also investigated an environmental pollutant modeled with three ammonia concentrations (0, 5 and 10 mM). Proliferation in the bioreactor was found to be flow rate and inoculated cell density dependent. This led to a mean value of 1.2 ± 0.2 × 106 cells in the 3D microenvironment of the bioreactor without ammonia loadings after 96 h of cultures. Cell metabolism rates, such as glucose and glutamine consumption or CYP1A detoxification, were found to be higher in dynamic conditions than in static conditions. Furthermore, increased ammonium chloride concentration in turn increased glucose and glutamine consumptions and CYP1A activity. Inhibition of 50% of cell proliferation (IC50) during the ammonium chloride analysis was found at 5 mM when cell concentrations of 0.35 × 106 cells/bioreactor were inoculated. In contrast, no effect could be detected at 5 mM for larger cell densities of 0.65 × 106 cells/bioreactor, demonstrating concentration and cell density dependence in the bioreactors.

These values in a similar level suggest that a common reaction such as β-oxidation before the synthesis of 3HA units is the rate-determining step.

     "abstract": "A simple and sensitive conductometric immunosensor for detection of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was designed using carbon nanoparticles as labels. The immunosensing probe was fabricated by means of the immobilization of monoclonal anti-AFP primary antibodies on an interdigitated conductometric transducer, while the detection antibodies were prepared using nanocarbon-conjugated horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-AFP (CNP-HRP-anti-AFP). With a sandwich-type immunoassay format, the conjugated CNP-HRP-anti-AFP on the transducer was increased with the increase of AFP in the sample, and the conductivity of the immunosensor was decreased in the H2O2–KI system. Under optimal conditions, the immunosensor exhibited a wide dynamic range of 0.1–500 ng/mL with a detection limit of 50 pg/mL AFP at 3σ. The reproducibility and recovery were <10% and 83.9–112.3%, respectively. Interestingly, 45 clinical serum specimens were assayed using the conductometric immunosensor, and the results were in accordance with those obtained from our Clinical Laboratory using Roche 2010 Electrochemiluminescent Automatic Analyzer.",

The expression of the single mutant Y96F in an Escherichia coli host resulted in indigo formation (approximately 23 mg/l), of which productivity was comparable to the highest reported so far using other P450cam mutant cultures. On the other hand, recombinant E. coli that harbored F87W-Y96F exhibited little activity for indigo production. However, co-expression of E. coli glycerol dehydrogenase (GLD) with F87W-Y96F triggered a marked increase in the productivity of indigo (approximately 20 mg/l) without external glycerol addition. These results indicate the potential of introducing GLD-mediated NADH regeneration that utilizes endogenous NAD+ and glycerol in E. coli to enhance markedly the catalytic performance of a low-activity recombinant P450cam system. The present E. coli whole-cell biocatalysts might be applicable to practical microbial indigo production.",

     "abstract": "The time-course of product accumulation during an enzyme-catalyzed reaction that conforms to the Michaelis–Menten rate equation is expressed by an explicit closed-form equation in terms of the Lambert W(x) function. Unfortunately, the use of direct solution of the Michaelis–Menten equation is limited, because the W(x) function is not widely available in curve-fitting software. The present commentary suggests an alternative to surmount this difficulty. The Lambert W(x) function can be approximated in terms of the elementary mathematical functions that enable the fitting of particular equations on time-course data of the Michaelis–Menten enzyme reaction by any nonlinear regression computer program. Three different demonstrated approximations of the W(x) with relatively high accuracies are shown here to be appropriate for use when progress curves are analyzed by the direct solution of the integrated Michaelis–Menten equation. The elementary and precise nature of these approximations makes them the most user-friendly open candidates for simple, but operative, kinetic parameter estimations from experimental time-course data.",

Statistical analysis of the experimental data using the response surface methodology showed that a glycerol-to-ornithine molar ratio of approximately 40:1 in the feed medium resulted in the highest CA concentration when fermentation was stopped.

     "abstract": "An industrial, ethanol-tolerant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, NRRL Y-132, was genetically engineered to over-express barley α-amylase isozyme 1 such that it was either anchored on the cell surface or secreted into the medium. The recombinant yeast strains were compared for their ability to perform fermentation on soluble starch. Both recombinant yeast strains produced clear halos on starch plates, indicating that they possessed amylolytic activity. In batch fermentation studies, the recombinant yeast strain that secreted barley α-amylase showed starch hydrolysis rates of 0.70 g L−1 h−1 on 20 g L−1 starch, which was almost double that of the anchored form. The addition of exogenous glucoamylase did not enhance starch hydrolysis rates but did increase ethanol yields, presumably by enhancing production of reducing sugars from the oligosaccharides produced by barley α-amylase. The ethanol yield of the secreting strain in batch fermentations containing 20 g L−1 starch was 3.46 g L−1, which was approximately three times higher than the anchored strain. By optimizing the batch fermentation conditions, ethanol yields were obtained that approached 70% of theoretical maximum. The results indicate that barley α-amylase, due to its ability to hydrolyze starch under the low pH conditions that occur during fermentation, should be more closely examined as an amylase source for bioethanol production. Furthermore, our results suggest that yeast strains that secrete α-amylase into the medium may be more efficacious relative to cell surface-displayed systems.",

     "abstract": "A real-time quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technique was employed to monitor early formation of Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilms. To better understand the dynamic process of conditioning film and early biofilm formation, all experiments were conducted in a laminar flow-through chamber under various environmental conditions. Prior to early biofilm formation, a conditioning film comprising organic, inorganic and macromolecular substances was detected over the sensor chip surface within an extremely short duration due to their instantaneous adsorption. Based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) observations, we identified different surface features associated with various conditioning films, demonstrating that the sensor chip surface displayed complex properties in terms of surface topography, roughness, water contact angle, and conditioning film chemistry. There appeared to be a lag time before early biofilm formation. The rate of early biofilm formation was found to differ considerably, depending upon the characteristics of conditioning films and environmental conditions. However, subsequent biofilm formation could be mediated by environmental conditions, reflecting the complex and dynamic process of biofilm development. Of particular interest was the direct in situ real-time observation of the overall sequence of biofilm development processes using a QCM, starting with conditioning film formation, followed by initial bacterial adhesion and subsequently by biofilm formation.",

The carbon source was date juice obtained from the Yucca fillifera. In order to determine the best batch model two different specific growth rate combinations were evaluated, one for substrate saturation with product inhibition and other for substrate and product inhibition. The best specific growth resulted in the combination for terms related to both substrate and product inhibition. The batch culture model predicts biomass and carotenoids production, as well as substrate consumption at sugar concentrations ranging from 5, 10, 20 and 40 g l−1, with mean values for the coefficient of determination of 0.9836, 0.9775, 0.9828 and 0.9651, respectively. The substrate concentration for 40 g l−1 was the weakest prediction for all the experimental data set; therefore a correction term was added to improve prediction from the mathematical model. The batch model was then extended to fed-batch culture with an inlet substrate concentration of 65 g l−1 where the mean value of 0.9868 for the coefficient of determination was obtained.",

     "abstract": "A novel and simple method for the preparation of chemically bonded poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) coating to silica capillary inner wall was developed, and the PVA-coated capillary columns were employed for capillary electrophoresis (CE). The coating procedure included pretreatment of the capillary inner wall, silanization, aldehyde group functionalization and PVA immobilization. Electroosmotic flow of the coated capillary was almost suppressed over a wide pH range (pH 3–10). High-efficiency separations of cationic proteins (including cytochrome c, lysozyme, α-chymotrypsinogen A) at pH 3.0–5.0 and of anionic proteins (including myoglobin and trypsin inhibitor) at pH 10.0 were achieved with the PVA-coated capillary. Moreover, a “dual-opposite-injection” approach was adopted for simultaneous separations of both cationic and anionic proteins at neutral pH with the prepared column. In this CE mode, positively charged proteins migrated from one end of the column to the detector while negatively charged proteins from the other end to the detection window. Good run-to-run repeatability was obtained in all of the protein CE separations performed in this work. The PVA-coated column can also afford long-term stable uses for protein separations, as demonstrated in 100 repeated uses using a single capillary with the relative standard deviation values of the retention times less than 0.9%. Moreover, good column-to-column reproducibility was demonstrated by protein CE separation with 10 different columns. The results indicate that the present method for PVA-coated capillary preparation is promising for protein CE applications.",

To improve R-MA productivity, a new biocatalytic process of in situ product removal (ISPR) has been developed utilizing anion-exchange resin. To optimize the bioconversion of R-MA from R,S-MN, several anion-exchange resins were examined: HZ202, demonstrated several exciting features including high R-MA and low R,S-MN adsorbance. In batch biotransformation, ISPR by addition of HZ202 increased R-MA volumetric productivity to 0.285 mmol/l/min. The kinetic models for enantioselective hydrolysis of R,S-MN by A. faecalis CCTCC M 208168 with ISPR were established, and they were well fitted to the experimental data of the reaction kinetics. In fed-batch biotransformation with ISPR was also performed. As compared to the conventional fed-batch mode, this approach allowed R-MA volumetric productivity and biocatalyst productivity to be increased from 0.083 mmol/l/min and 55.1 mmol/g to 0.281 mmol/l/min and 185.5 mmol/g, respectively.",

All the material residues acted as nutrient source for the microorganism, since FOS production occurred when all of them were used without nutrient supplementation, but not when the synthetic material was used.

A number of steroidal compounds were also isolated as minor products from the biotransformation, and one of these was identified as a novel compound named 3-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl (1 → 3) – β-d-glucopyranosyl (1 → 4) – β-d-glucopyranosyl-diosgenin (diosgenin-triglucoside). The biotransformation consisted of two stages: the release of steroids from the herb (accompanied by fungal growth) and hydrolysis of the steroids by glycosidases. Kinetic analysis and mathematical modelling showed that the process of biotransformation could be described by first-order kinetics under the condition of high Km/[S] values. It consisted of a cascade of consecutive and parallel reactions involving three kinds of enzymes, five steroid saponins and their sapogenin.

Steady state viscosity and the hysteresis area decreased significantly with increased ultrasonic specific energy.

Specifically, tunable and selective surface assembly of genetically modified Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV1cys) templates is exploited to control the loading of Pd nanocatalysts on solid substrates via preferential electroless deposition. In the first method, the surface density of Pd–TMV complexes is controlled by varying the concentration of TMV solution for surface assembly. Apparent surface density of Pd–TMV complexes from AFM images correlated well with the Pd loading observed via XPS and the catalytic activity in dichromate reduction, an important environmental remediation reaction for detoxification of abundant inorganic wastes. In the second method, the Pd catalyst loading is controlled by varying the gold surface area on patterned silicon chips. The catalytic activity of these chips correlated well with the surface area, further indicating control over the location of active Pd catalysts via selective surface assembly of viral templates.

To study mixing and its scalability in orbitally shaken cylindrical bioreactors, we measured mixing times in containers with nominal volumes from 2 to 1500 L with a colorimetric method using two pH indicators. Four operating parameters were tested: the liquid height, the shaking diameter, the agitation rate, and the inner diameter of the container. The mixing time decreased as the agitation rate increased until a minimal value was reached. As the shaking diameter was reduced, a higher agitation rate was needed to reach the minimal mixing time. The liquid height did not have a significant effect on the mixing time, but for a constant volume, an increase of the inner diameter slightly reduced the mixing time. The fastest mixed zones were close to the wall of the container while the zone in the center of the bulk liquid was the last to achieve homogeneity. Our study showed that the free-surface shape correlated with the mixing regime and that by keeping the inner-to-shaking diameter ratio as well as the Froude number (Fr) constant, the free-surface shapes and the mixing regimes of a 1500-L bioreactor could be mimicked in a 30-L bioreactor.

The present study investigates biological decolorization of RR 195 under alternate anaerobic–aerobic conditions in a laboratory scale Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) containing a mixed culture and fed with a biodegradable carbon source. Different values of the Sludge Retention Time (SRT), Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT), influent color and organic carbon loadings were adopted during the experimental activity and their effects on color and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal efficiencies and process kinetics determined. The optimal operating conditions were found to be: 800 mg l−1 influent COD, 50 d SRT and a 24 h-cycle. Under these conditions, the maximum color efficiency of 97% was achieved for a 40 mg l−1 RR 195 in the feed.

     "abstract": "A two-dimensional flow model, incorporating mass transport, has been developed to simulate a microchannel enzyme reactor with a porous wall. A two-domain approach based on the finite volume method was implemented. Two parameters are defined to characterize the mass transports in the fluid and porous regions: the porous Damkohler number and the fluid Damkohler number. For reactions close to first-order type (enzyme reactor), the concentration results are found to be well correlated by the use of a reaction–convection distance parameter which incorporates the effects of axial distance, substrate consumption and convection. The reactor efficiency reduces with reaction–convection distance parameter because of reduced reaction (or flux) due to the lower concentration. Increased fluid convection improves the efficiency but it is limited by the diffusion in the fluid region. The correlated results can find applications for the design of enzyme reactors with a porous wall.",

     "abstract": "In order to examine the structure–activity relationship and the substrate specificity of human d-amino acid oxidase (h.DAO), a single amino acid mutation had been established as proline-219-luecine (P-219-L). The gene encoding mutant h.DAO has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). It was observed that the host cell was negatively affected by the expressed mutant h.DAO, resulting in a remarkable decrease in the cell growth and consequently the amount of the produced enzyme. To overcome this problem, we investigated several factors that may affect the cell growth rate and the mutant h.DAO production such as optimization of the glucose concentration as a main carbon source and the yeast extract concentration as a main nitrogen source, optimization of dissolved oxygen (DO%) concentration and the addition of benzyl alcohol (BA, which can artificially induce a strong heat shock response at low temperature), to enhance the production of natively folded soluble fraction of the recombinant protein. These parameters were tested on both shake flask level and fed-batch bioreactor level. The Western blot analysis and the enzyme activity assay indicated the higher level of the mutant expression towards enhancement of the conditions by using our designed approach.The specific activity (which was used as an indicator for the level of the desired protein produced = U/mg protein) and the OD600 nm of the host cells (which was used as an indicator for the cell growth), reached to be 0.061 U/mg protein and 3.44, respectively upon using fed-batch culture system containing the optimized medium composition (15 g/l glucose and 5 g/l yeast extract). While upon using the shake flask level, these values were 0.032 and 1.1, respectively. Enhancement of the cell growth and the enzyme production was noticed after DO% optimization upon using 500 rpm agitation speed and 1.8 v.v.m. (volume volume minute) aeration. The specific activity for the mutant enzyme and the OD600 nm of the host cells reached to be 0.14 U/mg protein and 7.1, respectively. Finally upon using the optimized culture composition (15 g/l glucose and 5 g/l yeast extract), optimized DO% (using 500 rpm agitation speed and 1.8 v.v.m.) and 0.1 mM BA at the fed-batch bioreactor level, the specific activity and the OD600 nm of the host cells increased significantly to be 0.21 U/mg protein and 11.3, respectively at 24 h culture. These results indicate the importance of our approaches to overproducing mutant h.DAO in soluble form in E. coli.",

Functional bile canaliculi in sandwich-cultured hepatocytes on oxygen-permeable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes were re-established more quickly than those in a conventional sandwich culture on polystyrene (PS). This enhanced biliary excretory activity was also observed in hepatocytes on another oxygen-permeable membrane plate but not on a PDMS surface whose oxygen permeability is blocked. An apical efflux transporter protein, Mrp2, was more rapidly distributed in hepatocytes cultured on PDMS membranes than in hepatocytes cultured on conventional PS plates. Moreover, the area of distribution of the Mrp2 in polarized hepatocytes cultured on PDMS membranes was more widespread than that for the hepatocytes grown on sandwich-cultured PS plates. The observation of ultrastructure in transmission electron microscopy clearly confirmed the presence of bile canalicular lumens possessing microvilli and tight junctions. Additionally, we demonstrated that the 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation activity of hepatocytes on PDMS membranes was also improved as compared to those on a PS surface. Therefore, sandwich-cultured hepatocytes on oxygen-permeable substrates can provide a simple tool for predicting the hepatic metabolism and toxicity of xenobiotics in vivo with short span and low cost in the course of drug discovery and evaluation.",

     "abstract": "A mathematical model for the simulation of physical-biological organic removal by means of a membrane bioreactor (MBR) has been previously developed and tested. This paper presents an analysis of the uncertainty of the MBR model. Particularly, the research explores the applicability of the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology that is one of the most widely used methods for investigating the uncertainties in the hydrology and that now on is spreading in other research field. For the application of the GLUE methodology, several Monte Carlo simulations have been run varying the all model influential parameters simultaneously. The model was applied to an MBR pilot plant located at the Acqua dei Corsari WWTP (Palermo, IT) where water quality data were gathered. In particular, the MBR pilot plant consists of a lab-scale hollow fibre membrane module in submerged configuration. The GLUE methodology enabled us to gain useful insight about the robustness of the model approach. Particularly, the results showed that the biological process is influenced mainly by the parameters characterising the formation and degradation of Soluble Microbial Products, whereas the fouling phenomenon is mainly influenced by the backwashing efficiency. The application of the GLUE methodology shows that the model considered for the MBR simulation is somehow too simple in order to predict plants performances. Indeed, GLUE enabled us to identify the main model components that needs to be improved and where much attention has to be paid both in terms of model algorithms and quality data to be gathered. This studies confirmed the suitability of the GLUE methodology as a powerful tool for simplified screening methodology to assess the uncertainty also in the field of wastewater treatment.",

Tissue transglutaminase (tTGase) from guinea pig liver showed no cytotoxicity toward primary hepatocytes, and hepatocyte-embedded gelatin gel cultures could be realized. The albumin production activities in tTGase-mediated hepatocyte-embedded gelatin gel cultures were similar to those in collagen gel cultures, representing an established hepatocyte culture method for the expression of liver-specific functions. Therefore, it was expected that a hepatocyte-embedded gelatin gel culture system enabling high liver-specific function expression could be created. The CGS culture system was created by incubating a suspension of hepatocytes and tTGase-containing gelatin-filled hydrophilic-treated scaffolds at 37 °C. The albumin production activities in CGS with poly(l-lactic acid) macroporous scaffold (porosity = 68.4%) were inferior to those in tTGase–gelatin gel cultures because of a diffusion problem. However, the activities were similar between CGS with macroporous polyurethane foam (porosity = 98.8%) and tTGase–gelatin gel cultures, even under stationary conditions. On the other hand, further functional improvements of hepatocytes were achieved in HGF- or HGF/heparin-containing gel cultures. Based on these results, tTGase-mediated CGS cultures are expected to become a fundamental technology for the creation of engineered liver tissues.",

Specifically, we attempted to develop a yeast-predominant activated sludge system (Y-AS). For the batch-mode AS, bacteria-dominated AS (B-AS) obtained at pH 6.5–7.5 induced higher chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal than Y-AS obtained at acidic pH (5.0–6.0 and 4.0–5.0). For the continuous-mode AS operating at COD loadings of 2.5–2.8 kg COD m−3 d−1, it was difficult to achieve a Y-AS solely by controlling the pH level at 7.0 to 5.1 then to 4.1 because bacteria stably accounted for greater than 98% of the total cells, regardless of the pH levels. Therefore, the effects of varied COD loadings (2.1, 8.7 and 21.0 kg COD m−3 d−1) on continuous-mode AS operation at acidic pH (4.5) was investigated. Both acidic pH and high COD loading levels were found to be prerequisites for yeast to dominate the sludge microbial community in the continuous-mode AS.",

     "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the kinetics of linoleic acid production via lipase-mediated hydrolysis of corn DDGS oil in a batch reactor with continuous mechanical agitation and developed a kinetic model that incorporated the product inhibition to study the complete hydrolysis. The model agreed very well with observed data; though situations with low enzyme dosage or low stirring rates were modeled successfully without product inhibition, actual product concentration in such situations was too low to exert any inhibitory effects. Increasing the enzyme concentration increased hydrolysis, and beyond certain enzyme concentrations, effects tended to fade away because of excessive enzyme desorption from the interface. An enzyme dosage within the range of 40–60 KLU/L of oil dispersion could be successfully applied for a substrate concentration of 25–50 g/L of DDGS oil. Increasing the agitation rates improved enzymatic hydrolysis, but a higher stirring rate of 1000 rpm moderately improved production of linoleic acid compared with a stirring rate of 750 rpm. Within the range of substrate concentrations studied, enzymatic inhibition was moderate but still evident. The high degree of hydrolysis (i.e., ∼96% of theoretical linoleic acid yield) from DDGS oil suggests this method has potential for commercial production of linoleic acid.",

     "abstract": "l-homophenylalanine can be used as a precursor for production of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which possesses significant clinical application in the management of hypertension and congestive heart failure (CHF). Pure chiral l-homophenylalanine can be synthesized efficiently by employing enzymatic methods. The biocatalysts used for biotransformation must be retained and reused due to their costs. Conventional processes for l-homophenylalanine production utilized dialysis bag for biocatalysts retention. Nevertheless, this could only be efficiently adopted for laboratory scale processes which possess low scale-up potential. In order to overcome this problem, integrated membrane bioreactor is highlighted for sustainable biocatalytic synthesis of l-homophenylalanine in environmentally friendly conditions which has not been explored by other researchers. The yield of biocatalytic reactions is greatly affected by the pH of the reaction solution, as enzymes are highly sensitive to pH change. Thus in this study, the influence of pH on the product yield at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure was evaluated. By using l-phenylalanine dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase as the biocatalysts, it was found that pure l-homophenylalanine could be synthesized with >80% yield and an enantiomeric excess of over 99% in the integrated membrane bioreactor by adjusting the pH of the reaction solution. The optimal pH was found to be 8.5, when independent of other parameters.",

     "abstract": "Partial nitrification to nitrite saves oxygen and organic matter. A dynamic model of a rotating disk biofilm reactor was developed in order to determine optimal operation conditions for partial nitrification. The biofilm model considered the active biomass fraction as a state variable; it was calibrated at steady state using the adjustment of two parameters – μmax,AOB (1.32 d−1) and kL (0.44 m h−1) and validated with long-term experiments. The experimental data were attained running the reactor in continuously and in batch modes for more than 700 days at different pH values, oxygen concentrations and nitrogen load rates (NLRs). A good agreement between the measured and modeled results was obtained with a Theil inequality coefficient lower than 0.3 for both calibration and validation. The model predicts that the active biomass fraction does not reach steady-state before 40 operating days, and the active nitrite-oxidizing bacteria fraction is much more sensitive than the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria fraction to the pH. Results demonstrated that nitrite accumulation (β) is strongly influenced by the NLR and the pH. The optimal operation zone for β > 70% is reached for NLRs between 8.5 and 11.5 g N m−2 d−1, pH > 8 and dissolved oxygen concentration <3 mg O2 L−1.",

Volumetric and specific enzyme activities were investigated in relation to inducer concentration in a batch process using a defined medium with glucose as the carbon source. While IPTG is routinely used to induce expression of genes under the control of lac promoter, the impact of high biomass concentration on IPTG induction has not been reported rigorously. In this study, biomass production was unaffected by IPTG concentration across the range 0–1000 μM. Induction of recombinant protein expression by 400 μM IPTG at late lag phase of growth (3rd hour) inhibited cell growth while induction at early exponential phase of growth (5th hour) gave a 3 fold increase in volumetric amidase activity compared to induction at mid exponential phase (8th hour). Protein production increased by a factor of two with IPTG addition, independent of IPTG concentration in the range of 40–1000 μM. Amidase activity, measured on a volumetric basis and relative to protein and biomass concentrations, increased with increasing IPTG concentration up to 400 μM. While inducer concentrations are typically reported on a volumetric basis, their mode of action is consistent with a biomass dependence. Analysis of the data across a range of biomass concentration confirmed that induction was a function of inducer concentration per unit biomass. The amidase enzyme was predominantly soluble and cytoplasmic with less than 3% retained within the cell debris.",

The role of DOTAP liposome on the inhibition of mRNA translation was revealed that the cationic quaternary amine groups on the liposome surface can interact and neutralize the anionic phosphate groups on mRNA by an electrostatic interaction. mRNA molecules still existed without any degradation in the presence of DOTAP liposome although it could not be translated. These results clearly illustrated that the DOTAP liposome could knock down mRNA and silence its activity of translation in an E. coli cell-free system.",

In this study, synergistic action of different lytic enzymes from two thermophilic bacteria, Geobacillus spp. SY9 and SY14, were discovered to promote the lysis of long-cultured cells. The combinational action of the lytic enzymes from the two thermophilic bacteria were significantly better than their individual action and the cell lysis rates at the optimized combinational ratio were higher than that of their individual action by 2–3 times. The results of selective inhibition test infer that the potential lytic enzymes of SY9 and SY14 are glycosidase and peptidase, respectively.

Compared with regular yeast suspension, which is a Newtonian fluid in general, the suspension of yeast flocs exhibited non-Newtonian fluid behavior, from a pseudoplastic fluid with biomass concentration lower than 40 g/L to a yield pseudoplastic fluid as biomass concentration increased, since the higher the biomass concentration, the more resistant the suspension to shear force. On the other hand, it was found that, when yeast flocs size decreased to about 200 μm, a linear correlation between shear rate and shear stress was established, and the rheological property of the suspension was close to a Newton fluid, but non-Newtonian flow behavior developed when the size of yeast flocs increased to above that criterion, indicating its main contribution to the non-Newtonian flow behavior of the suspension.

The main goals were: (a) to identify and calibrate a kinetic model of TeCA cometabolism; (b) to select and characterize a TeCA-degrading bacterial consortium; (c) to compare the results obtained in slurry and in soil-free bioreactors. The results showed that 4 of the 5 tested aquifers contain TeCA-degrading bacteria, indicating that aerobic cometabolism is a potentially effective approach for TeCA-contaminated aquifers. In bioaugmentation tests, a TeCA-cometabolizing consortium developed in the slurry bioreactors induced a strong reduction of the lag-time for the onset of TeCA cometabolism. The soil-free tests yielded a satisfactory TeCA degradation performance, indicating that on-site soil-free bioreactors represent an interesting technical solution for the aerobic cometabolic bioremediation of CAH-contaminated groundwaters. The mineralization of the organic Cl was equal to about 97%. The prolonged TeCA biodegradation determined a progressive selection of the bacterial strains more effective in TeCA degradation and less affected by degradation product toxicity. The tested Michaelis–Menten-based kinetic model proved an effective tool to interpret the experimental data of TeCA aerobic cometabolism.",

Two fermentations were performed, one was pH controlled (pH 6.8), and the other was pH uncontrolled. Cells were collected after 10 h (late exponential phase), 25 h (mid stationary phase) and 37 h (late stationary phase) of fermentation. In the case of the pH controlled fermentation, the acid tolerance of the cells collected at 10 h was remarkably high, as the viability decreased only by 0.2 logs; in the case of the 25 h and 37 h, it decreased 1.5 and 6.0 logs, respectively. In the case of the pH uncontrolled fermentation, for all three time points the cell reduction was high, ranging between 3 and 4 logs. The cells from the pH controlled fermentation, and in particular the cells from the 10 h sample, demonstrated considerably higher glycolytic activity compared to the cells from the uncontrolled fermentation. The type of fermentation had a lesser effect on the ability of the cells to survive during freeze drying, as in all cases the cell reduction was small (<1 log). The cells from the 10 h sample from the pH controlled fermentation survived significantly (P < 0.05) better than the cells from the 25 and 37 h sample; the opposite was the case for the cells from the pH uncontrolled fermentation. However, in all cases, the differences between the samples were less than 0.5 log. In conclusion, both the fermentation pH and time were found to have a significant impact on the glycolytic activity of L. rhamnosus GG, and on its ability to survive under acidic conditions and during freeze drying.",

Recently, vaccination has emerged as an alternative to control tick infestations that has shown the advantage of being cost-effective, avoids environmental contamination and prevents selection of drug-resistant ticks resulting from repeated acaricides applications. However, the success of vaccination is highly dependent on the availability of effective vaccines at affordable prices. Recombinant DNA technology has provided the mean for producing antigens in large quantities making possible the development and commercialization of anti-tick vaccines. In the early 1990s, a technology was developed to produce a commercial anti-tick vaccine based on the recombinant BM86 (rBM86) antigen isolated from R. (Boophilus) microplus and intracellularly expressed in Pichia pastoris. However, the technological process for its production was expensive. Herein we conducted an economical analysis of this technology in comparison with other reported processes. The results allowed the identification of critical steps in the technology and addressed research for bioprocess optimization. As a result, two alternative bioprocesses were developed to produce anti-tick vaccines based on the rBM86 protein secreted in P. pastoris and by displaying antigenic peptides on the Escherichia coli membrane (BM95-MSP1a antigen). Vaccine production costs were reduced from US$0.92/dose for the intracellular rBM86 to US$0.72/dose and US$0.56/dose for the secreted rBM86 and BM95-MSP1a, respectively.",

With this control strategy, pIFN-α antiviral activity could be continuously enhanced and eventually reached a level of 3.62 × 107 IU/ml, which was about 16-fold of the maximum obtained when induction was done at 20 °C but without DO control, and more than 100-fold of the maximum obtained with the standard induction strategy at 30 °C. The novel control strategy could enhance alcohol oxidase (AOX) activity and relieve oxygen supply limitation in oxidative phosphorylation reaction to accelerate ATP regeneration simultaneously.

The spatial-temporal evolution of the concentration fields are governed by convection–diffusion equations for non-magnetic cells and Nernst–Planck type equations for beads and cell–bead(s) complexes. The attachment rates between cells, cell–bead(s) complexes and beads are deduced from the collision probabilities which are derived by means of classical scattering theory. The CFD model is used to investigate the performance of a generic continuous cell separation system. Since the cells are larger in diameter, more than one bead can get attached to the cells. Multiple beads binding to the cell has been considered in this study, which has not been reported in literature till date.

The immobilization of A. junii on perlite was dependent on the particle size, but not on the zeta potential of particles. The SSA of the perlite samples influenced immobilization of A. junii but was not recognized as the crucial factor. Immobilized bacteria were metabolically active and successfully removed phosphate from the wastewater when incubated in pure culture or in bioaugmented activated sludge. In the system with activated sludge the best carrier of A. junii was the semi-expanded perlite which was well incorporated in the sludge. The expanded perlite was floating on the surface of the wastewater while raw perlite sunk to the bottom of the reactor, diminishing the exposure and consequently phosphate removal of immobilized bacteria in the wastewater.",

     "abstract": "Pharmaceuticals are regarded as emerging environmental pollutants since many of them are ubiquitous, recalcitrant and biologically active. In this paper, the degradation of several pharmaceuticals such as anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac and naproxen) and estrogen hormones (estrone, 17β-estradiol, 17α-ethinylestradiol) was assessed by means of the commercial laccase (Lac) from Myceliophthora thermophila. The influence of different mediators (synthetic and natural) and their concentration on the Lac-based oxidation system were evaluated. Estrogens were completely degraded after only 15 min while the other types of pharmaceuticals presented higher persistence since 1 h of incubation was required for total removal of diclofenac and 8 h to attain up to 60% of naproxen degradation. Among the different natural mediators, syringaldehyde greatly enhanced the action of the Lac, similarly to the synthetic mediator 1-hydroxibenzotriazole (HBT) in the case of estrogens and diclofenac. The other natural mediators presented significantly high efficiency, obtaining removal percentages ranging from 80% to 100% after 24 h of enzymatic reaction.",

The hydrogels were prepared from aqueous solutions of CMCs with 16.7 (CMC-Ph16) and 7.3 (CMC-Ph7) phenolic hydroxy (Ph-OH) groups per 100 repeat units of uronic acid, via peroxidase-catalyzed crosslinking reaction between Ph-OH groups. Hepatocytes formed aggregates on both hydrogels but the aggregates on CMC-Ph16 gel had more flattened configuration than on CMC-Ph7 gel. The flat aggregates stably immobilized onto CMC-Ph16 gel while spherical aggregates on CMC-Ph7 gel could be easily detached from the surface. In addition, hepatocytes on CMC-Ph16 gel showed more stable mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity and albumin secretion function for 7 days than on CMC-Ph7 gel, tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS), and TCPS coated with collagen (CL). The retention of albumin secretion function per well after 7 days of seeding was 86% on CMC-Ph16 gel, 18% on CMC-Ph7 gel, 9% on TCPS, and 6% on CL.

The PHEMA cryogel was prepared by bulk polymerization which proceeds in an aqueous solution of monomer frozen inside a plastic syringe (cryo-polymerization). After thawing, the PHEMA cryogel contains a continuous matrix having interconnected macropores of 10–200 μm size. Pore volume in the PHEMA cryogel was 71.6%. Protein A molecules were covalently immobilized onto the PHEMA cryogel via cyanogen bromide (CNBr) activation.

Five nutritional factors, including malic acid, yeast extract, (NH4)2SO4, MgSO4·7H2O, and ferric citrate, were optimized for CoQ10 production using response surface methodology (RSM) in static test tube cultures. The optimal medium for CoQ10 production were (g/l): malic acid, 2.5; yeast extract, 1.29; (NH4)2SO4, 1.34; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.20; 0.90 g/l K2HPO4, 0.90; KH2PO4, 0.60; ferric citrate, 0.08; and EDTA, 0.02.

The yield of CoQ10 in a 3-l fermentor was higher than that achieved in the static culture and reached 10.81 mg/l, which could be attributed to the constant agitation (400 rpm) that enhanced cell–substrate contact throughout the fermentation. The optimal medium compositions acquired in the present study provide a solid foundation for further improvement and optimization of fermentation processes that can be suitable for industrial-scale production of CoQ10.",

The SAA values obtained from biomass adapted under the same salinity conditions and collected from the reactor could be used to calculate the maximum capacity of the system and, therefore, to predict its efficiency at a certain operation condition. Batch assays carried out with non-adapted and adapted Anammox biomass at different salt concentrations indicated a stimulatory effect on the SAA at concentrations up to 6 and 15 g NaCl L−1 while higher salt concentrations caused a decrease in the activity. The addition of salt enhanced the aggregation of Anammox biomass in granules with a consequent decrease in the Sludge Volumetric Index from 80 to 25 mL g VSS−1. The system was able to treat a nitrite loading rate around 0.32 g NO2−-N L−1 d−1 when salt concentrations of 15 g L−1 of NaCl were present in the feeding, with nitrogen removal efficiencies of 99%.

     "publication date": "09-2010",
     "abstract": "This paper studies the synthesis of triacylglycerols (TAGs) rich in palmitic acid (PA) at sn-2 position from palm stearin (PS), a vegetable oil highly rich in PA (60%, but only 12.8% of this is located at sn-2 position). These PA rich TAGs were obtained by lipase-catalyzed acidolysis of this oil with free fatty acids (FFAs) highly rich in PA, such as commercial PA (98% PA) and a FFA extract obtained by saponification of PS (60% PA). PA has a melting point of 63 °C and during the acidolysis reaction the substrates, highly rich in this acid, must remain liquid; therefore high temperatures or solvents must be used. An important objective of this work was to operate without solvent and at the lowest possible temperature. In this acidolysis reaction four factors were firstly studied: type of lipase, temperature, solvent amount and the intensity of treatment (IOT = lipase amount × reaction time/PS amount). The influence of these variables was studied in a stirred tank reactor (STR). The lipases tested were Novozym 435 from Candida antarctica (immobilized on a macroporous acrylic resin), and lipases QLC (immobilized on diatomaceous earth), and QLM (non-immobilized), both from Alcaligenes sp., and the one selected was lipase QLC. According to the manufacturer the optimum temperature for this lipase is 65–70 °C, which allows it to operate without solvent. The best results with lipase QLC (TAGs with 80% PA, both total and at sn-2 position) were obtained with commercial PA, at 65 °C, a 3:1 FFA/PS molar ratio (1:1, w/w), without solvent and an IOT = 7 g lipase × h/g PS (for example 2.5 g PS, 2.5 g commercial PA, 0.75 g lipase and 24 h). These results were the basis for establishing the operational conditions to obtain PA rich TAGs with the lipase immobilized in a packed bed reactor (PBR), operating by recirculation of the reaction mixture through the lipase bed. In this system TAGs with 75% PA were obtained at an IOT = 8 g lipase × h/g PS. This result and the apparent kinetic constants obtained in both reactors show that the reaction rate is lower in the PBR than in the STR. Subsequently, PA enriched TAGs were separated from FFAs by two procedures: the first one at room temperature and in presence of hexane and the second one at 65 °C and without hexane. Using the first procedure, 95% of TAGs in the acidolysis reaction mixture were recovered with a purity of 99%. Using the second one, 98% pure TAGs were obtained with a recovery yield of 80%. Therefore, these highly rich PA TAGs can be obtained by acidolysis of PS and PA rich FFAs in solvent-free media, and then these TAGs also can be purified to 98% in absence of hexane, using only a hydroethanolic KOH solution.",

The influence of DBD exposure on S. pyogenes was evaluated at 5, 10, and 15 min by two methods: turbidimetry analysis (for liquid solution) and determination of the number of colony-forming units (for solid media). Bacterial survival was strongly dependent upon on the working gas used. For a cultured LB liquid solution, it reached (21 ± 5)% and (70 ± 8)% at an exposure time of 15 min with O2 and CO2 working gases, respectively. Bacterial cell growth on the surface of the LB plate was 1 colony and 270 colonies for O2 and CO2 gases, respectively. The results suggest that the DBD of O2 gas could be efficient in the disinfection of S. pyogenes in liquid and surface cultured media. The processes could be attributed to ozone and the excited singlet state O2(a1Δg) as the active chemical agents.",

The Monod equation was applied to describe the growth kinetics of this microorganism and values of μmax and Ks of 0.242 h−1 and 0.396 g L−1, respectively, were achieved.

Further analysis indicated that these findings are related to the diffusional barrier resulting from the calcium alginate beads, which hinder the transport of gluconic acid from the inner space of the beads to the external medium. This behavior was reproduced during the initial moments of bioconversion performed at pH 7.8 and 47 °C. Nevertheless, during the last hours of the process, the reaction stopped because of inadequate pH levels inside the beads.

     "abstract": "A cathode-on-top single-chamber microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) was constructed by putting the cathode above the anode. The cathode was made of mipor titanium tube coated with platinum and the anode was graphite granules with exoelectrogens absorbed on its surface. Sodium acetate was used as the substrate. In 24 h batch tests, when the applied voltages increased from 0.2 V to 1.0 V with an interval of 0.1 V, the hydrogen production rates increased from 0.03 L/L/d to 1.58 L/L/d, and the overall hydrogen recoveries increased from 26.03% to 87.73%. The maximum overall energy recovery was 86.78% when the applied voltage was 0.6 V. Meanwhile, hydrogen production was accompanied by evolution of methane, and the main methane producer in this MEC was hydrogenotrophic methanogens. The methane production rate increased with the increase of the hydrogen production rate when the applied voltage was under 0.5 V; however, it maintained approximately 0.04 L/L/d when the applied voltage was above 0.5 V. These results demonstrate that putting the cathode above the anode is able to increase the hydrogen recoveries but also obtain high hydrogen production rates. These results also demonstrate that operating this MEC at a relative higher voltage (>0.6 V) is able to reduce methane production and improve the hydrogen recovery in 24 h batch tests.",

     "abstract": "The present study describes the characterization of crude protease from Bacillus mojavensis A21 and its evaluation in detergent and chicken feathers hydrolysis. The strain was found to produce at least six major extracellular proteases as shown by casein-zymography. The optimum pH and temperature for proteolytic activity were 8.0–11.0 and 60 °C, respectively. The crude protease showed extreme stability towards non-ionic (5% Tween 80 and 5% Triton X-100) and anionic (1% SDS) surfactants, and relative stability towards oxidizing agents. Additionally, it showed excellent stability and compatibility with various solid (7 mg/ml) and liquid (1%; v/v) detergents at temperatures from 30 to 50 °C. In the presence of solid detergents, the enzyme preparation retained 100% of its initial activity after pre-incubation for 1 h at 40 °C with Axion and Ariel, followed by Nadhif (87%), Dixan (85%) and New Det (82%). With liquid detergents, the enzyme preparation retained 100% of its original activity after pre-incubation for 1 h at 40 °C with Dixan and Nadhif. Wash performance analysis revealed that A21 crude protease could effectively remove blood-stains. In addition, B. mojavensis A21 proteolytic preparation showed important feather degrading activity.Considering its promising properties, B. mojavensis A21 enzymatic preparation may be considered a potential candidate for future use in biotechnological processes, particularly in detergent and in the processing of poultry waste.",

However, a more conservative approach is adopted in industry where specific growth rate is kept below the critical value to prevent the accumulation of overflow metabolite ethanol by using predetermined feeding profiles. In this work, biomass growth is maintained just above maximum oxidative growth rate by regulating ethanol concentration in the fermenter. The state feedback linearizing control strategy is developed and applied to the technical scale fed-batch yeast fermentations. The proposed control algorithm is constructed on the reliable state estimation algorithm developed previously and the biomass concentrations and ethanol measurements are then used in the control algorithm. The ethanol concentration is successfully controlled at fixed and time varying set values. By this approach the specific growth rate is controlled just over the critical value by regulating minimal ethanol concentration in order to maximize the biomass productivity.",

It was ascertained that there was superior enzymatic stability at high values of viscosity. The addition of surfactant below CMC displayed the dual benefit of increasing mass transfer of the substrate fivefold from the organic to aqueous phase whilst also creating a protecting effect upon VP.

     "abstract": "A biotrickling filter (BTF) was used to treat NH3 emitted from the exhaust gases of cattle manure compost. Results of the non-biofilm experiment suggested that NH3 could not be removed effectively only through biofilm adsorption. The absence of NH4+ bio-oxidation resulted in an increase in free ammonia, which had a negative effect on NH3 removal. After biofilm culture, NH3 removal efficiency fluctuated between 67.2% and 94.3% because the presence of a biofilm extended the liquid residence time in the packing. When the biofilm was inoculated with nitrifying bacteria comprised of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), which were screened from a cattle manure solution, the average removal efficiencies became 59.9% and 15.0% higher than those of the non-biofilm and biofilm culture experiments, respectively. AOB and NOB could still oxidize ammonia and nitrite, respectively, even when the free nitrous acid concentration was as high as 37.6 mg/L. With an empty bed retention time of 96.0 s and a removal efficiency of 99%, NH3 elimination capacities were attained at 57.1, 28.6, and 23.7 g-N/(m3 h) for the first segment, the first and second segment, and the whole BTF, respectively.

It was seen that, 50% (w/v) ammonium sulfate saturation with 1:1 (v/v) ratio of crude extract to t-butanol at pH 4.5 gave 8.6-fold purification with 190% activity recovery of invertase in a single step.

In spite of the abundant experimental evidence regarding xylitol production, the advances in the mathematical description of the process are relatively scarce. In this work, a stoichiometric model considering the main biochemical reactions (metabolic fluxes) involved in microaerobic xylitol production is proposed. The main metabolic reactions in xylitol production by Candida parapsilosis were incorporated in order to establish a stoichiometric reaction rate analysis of the network. The reaction rates in the metabolic network were calculated both for determined and underdetermined systems. A comparison between predicted and experimentally measured or reported yields has shown that the proposed stoichiometric model correctly depicts the xylitol yield within a 12.8% average error for several xylose-assimilating yeasts. The expected xylitol concentrations for a production process were also estimated after a sensitivity analysis of the metabolic network. An analysis of the estimated metabolic fluxes provided insight into some physiological events involved in the production of xylitol by yeasts.",

To achieve this, we conducted protein extractions at room temperature by using different solvents at various solvent to solid ratios and performed multistage counter current extraction to improve protein recovery and protein concentration. We obtained the highest protein recovery of 82% by using 0.055 M NaOH at solvent to solid ratio of 10 g/g after four-stage counter current extraction.

It was influenced by the utilization of extracellular substrate glutamate, which was a relatively low-efficiency procedure in γ-PGA fermentation. Then it was discovered that the glutamate utilization was greatly dependent on the medium pH. However, the optimal pH for glutamate utilization was not consistent with that for the cell growth. Therefore, in order to obtain the optimal production of γ-PGA, a two-stage pH-shift control strategy was proposed. At first 24 h, pH was controlled at 7.0 to obtain the maximum biomass, and then shifted to 6.5 to obtain high level of glutamate utilization and γ-PGA production. By applying such a pH-shift control strategy, the glutamate utilization increased from 24.3 to 29.5 g/l, the intracellular glutamate, which was the direct substrate, also increased, and consequently the yield of γ-PGA increased from 22.2 to 27.7 g/l, increased by 24.8%. This was the first report of using a two-stage pH-shift control strategy in γ-PGA production, and it was proved to be an effective way for the optimization of γ-PGA production in this strain.",

Radio frequency (RF) heating can be used for uniform heating of the packed bed during the extraction. Based on local volume averaging (LVA) and local thermal equilibrium (LTE), a mathematical model with variable properties was developed for transient heat transfer during RF-assisted packed bed extraction of podophyllotoxin. The validity of LVA and LTE was assessed by evaluating the length scale, time scale, and convective constraint. A control function was included in the model to take into account the effect of a temperature controller functioning during the actual RF-assisted packed bed extraction. For a vertical packed bed reactor subjected to RF heating, two governing equations associated with the packed bed and the solvent phase at the top of the bed were numerically solved using implicit-finite difference and Gauss–Seidel methods. The simulation results had a good agreement with the experimental data. Heat transfer simulation was performed for different flow rates of ethanol/water solution with different dielectric properties during the RF-assisted packed bed extraction process.",

In this range a strictly growth associated biooxidation with constant yield coefficient was proven, while at suboptimal pH values non-growth associated iron biooxidation was shown at pH as low as 0.4. This effect was taken into consideration for the derivation of a Monod-type kinetic model, derived on first principles from the electrochemical-enzymatic model for ferrous iron biooxidation.

     "abstract": "Methane is an important greenhouse gas which is produced from many natural and anthropogenic sources. It plays an important role in overall global warming. A significant amount of methane is removed through microbiological oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria, which are widespread in the environment, including many extreme environments. The key enzyme of these microorganisms, methane monooxygenase (MMO), especially the soluble MMO, is remarkable in its broad substrate specificity. This unique capability, i.e. catalyzing reactions of environmental importance, has attracted great attention for applied microbiologists and biochemical engineers. In this review, recent advances in the application of methanotrophs to environmental bioengineering are summarized, including biodiversity, catalytic properties, and cultivation, etc. We have focused on two aspects of the application and potential value of methanotrophs in environmental bioengineering, namely methane removal and biodegradation of toxic compounds. The removal of methane produced from landfills has been widely studied, and much of this work can be used as a source of reference for coal mine gas removal. Many bioreactors using methanotrophs in bioremediation have been developed in recent years. These reactors have two forms of configuration, single-stage and multi-stage. Current limitations which may affect the engineering applications of methanotrophs are discussed, such as the lack of suitable methanotrophic isolate, gas transfer limitation, competitive inhibition of MMO, regeneration of reducing equivalents for MMO and product toxicity.",

     "abstract": "In aerobic process oxygen must be continuously supplied in order to achieve acceptable productivities, Since the role of oxygen in microorganism growth and its metabolism is of vital importance, both the oxygen consumption by the cell and the oxygen transfer rate (OTR) into the system have to be understood.The main function of a properly designed bioreactor is to provide a controlled environment and a concentration of nutrients (dissolved oxygen, mainly) sufficient to achieve optimal growth and/or optimal product formation in a particular bioprocess. Dissolved oxygen in the broths is the result of a balance of its consumption rate in the cells, and the rate of oxygen transfer from the gas to the liquid phase. Monitoring dissolved oxygen in the broth is mandatory because often oxygen becomes the factor governing the metabolic pathways in microbial cells.In this work the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) in different fermentation broths is examined. Experimental techniques have been compiled from the literature and their applicability to microbial processes reviewed. The reciprocal influence of OUR and OTR is presented and an analysis of rate-limiting variables is carried out.Mathematical models are a fundamental tool in bioprocess design, optimisation, scale-up, operation and control at large-scale fermentation. Kinetic models describing aerobic bioprocesses have to include an oxygen balance taking into account OTR and OUR. Many different specific rate expressions for cell growth, substrate consumption, product formation and oxygen uptake have been developed and incorporated in the models, and simulations of different bioprocess have been carried out.

This study applied 3D cultured hepatocytes in gel entrapment for drug-induced phospholipidosis, and amiodarone was used as a model drug. By amiodarone exposure for 48 h, 3D cultured hepatocytes showed large number of lysosomal lamellar bodies (indicating phospholipidosis) and toxic response at a low dose of 2.5 μM, equivalent to toxic serum concentration in rats. This sensitivity to amiodarone-induced phospholipidosis might relate to the more intracellular drug distribution in 3D cultured hepatocytes. Moreover, steatosis, mitochondrial injury and oxidative stress were all sensitively detected in 3D cultured hepatocytes, well reflecting the involvement of these mechanisms in amiodarone hepatotoxicity. In addition, pretreatment of 3D cultured hepatocytes by CYP 3A1/2 inhibitor (ketoconazole) significantly reduced the toxicity of amiodarone, indicating the positive mediation of CYP 3A1/2. By comparison, 2D cultured hepatocytes did not show significant phospholipidosis and involvement of CYP 3A1/2. In conclusion, hepatocytes in 3D culture well reflected amiodarone toxicity and thus could be a promising model for phospholipidosis study.",

Although the program-based flux analysis is powerful, it is not easy to be confident with the result obtained without experiences and exhaustive trial and errors based on statistical analysis for the confidence intervals in practice. It is, therefore, quite important to grasp the relationship between the fluxes and the 13C-labeled isotopomer distribution to get deeper insight into the metabolic flux analysis. In the present research, it was shown explicitly how the isotopomer distribution changes with respect to the fluxes in relation to the labeling patterns of the substrate, where either labeled glucose, acetate, or pyruvate was used as a carbon source. Some of the analytical expressions were derived based on the matrix representation, and they were utilized for analysis. It was shown that the isotopomer pattern does not necessarily change uniformly with respect to fluxes, but changes in a complicated way in particular for the case of using pyruvate as a carbon source where some isotopomers do not necessarily change monotonically. It was shown to be quite important to grasp how the isotopomer pattern changes with respect to fluxes and the labeling pattern of the substrate for flux determination and the experimental design. It was also shown that the mixture of [1-13C] acetate and [2-13C] acetate should not be used from the information index point of view. Some of the experimental data were evaluated from the present approach. It was also shown that the isotopomer distribution is less sensitive to the bidirectional fluxes in the reversible pathway.",

Immiscible hydrocarbons (n-decane, n-tridecane and n-hexadecane) were utilized in the experiments as impurity. A type of anionic surfactant was also employed in order to investigate the effect of addition of surfactant to organic-aqueous systems on sauter mean bubble diameter, gas hold-up and oxygen transfer coefficient. Influence of addition of alkanes on oxygen transfer coefficient and gas hold-up, was shown to be dependent on the superficial gas velocity. At superficial gas velocity below 0.5 × 10−3 m/s, addition of alkane in air–water medium has low influence on oxygen transfer coefficient and also gas hold-up, whereas; at higher gas velocities slight addition of alkane increases oxygen transfer coefficient and also gas hold-up. Increase in concentration of alkane resulted in increase in oxygen transfer coefficient and gas hold-up and roughly decrease in sauter mean bubble diameter, which was attributed to an increase in the coalescence-inhibiting tendency in the presence of surface contaminant molecules. Bubbles tend to become smaller with decreasing surface tension of hydrocarbon, thus, oxygen transfer coefficient increases due to increasing of specific gas–liquid interfacial area (a). Empirical correlations were proposed for evaluating gas hold-up as a function of sauter mean bubble diameter, superficial gas velocity and interfacial surface tension as well as evaluating Sherwood number as a function of Schmidt, Reynolds and Bond numbers.",

First, three critical medium components among others were selected by the Plackett–Burman design.

     "abstract": "Laccase–mediator systems have the disadvantage that the mediator is expensive and potentially toxic. In this work, we used N-hydroxyacetanilide (NHA) in combination with laccase for the first time to bleach eucalypt pulp and found it to be a very promising, advantageous alternative to 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) as mediator. Thus, NHA is efficiently oxidized by laccase to a radical that absorbs light at 350 nm. Also, NHA is a better substrate for laccase than is HBT. An innovative result is that the enzyme is inactivated to a similar extent by both mediators under the typical treatment conditions of the bleaching step (L). This adverse effect, however, is strongly reduced in the presence of pulp. Moreover, the laccase–NHA system is as efficient as the laccase–HBT system in reducing the kappa number of eucalyptus pulp. Using a xylanase pretreatment or unbleached pulp boosts kappa number reduction and bleaching with the laccase–mediator system. Based on the results of cyclic voltammetry tests, NHA has a slightly lower redox potential than HBT, which further supports use of the former; also, unlike HBT, NHA is oxidized in a reversible, pH-dependent manner. Interestingly, the laccase–NHA system provides more efficient bleaching of eucalyptus pulp at pH 5 than it does at pH 4.",

The immobilization on Eupergit® C was optimized by considering different ionic strengths, pH and temperatures. SHMT reached 53% retention on this support. Although the enzymatic activity of the derivative decreased by 36% during the treatment with methylamine and washing, it was totally recovered by incubation with the cofactor. SHMT immobilized on Eupergit® C gained thermal stability with respect to the soluble enzyme. Finally, 6-His-tagged SHMT was adsorbed very rapidly on IMAC supports and reached a 98% immobilization yield and enzymatic retention. The capacity of Eupergit® C beads to immobilize PLP-dependent enzymes was corroborated by the immobilization of alanine racemase and aspartate aminotransferase.

     "abstract": "Many biological processes have utilized the addition of sulfide constituents, such as sodium sulfide or cysteine-sulfide, to affect the redox potential, remove residual oxygen, and/or provide a source of sulfur for metabolism. However, the effects of sulfide constituents and associated sulfide concentrations on growth and product formation of cellular systems have shown considerable variance. In this work, models were developed that explained sulfide loss in bottle studies (batch reactors) and continuously gas-purged reactors. Since sulfide in liquid can be converted to volatile hydrogen sulfide (H2S), mass transfer plays a key role for sulfide loss in continuous reactors, whereas equilibrium is critical for sulfide loss in batch reactors. Models of sulfide can be used to understand the fate of sulfide during an experiment and to design experiments to maintain constant sulfide levels for providing greater clarity when interpreting experimental results. Cellular experiments for ethanol/acetic acid formation from syngas were carried out to demonstrate the maintenance of constant sulfide levels of 0–1.9 mM throughout the experiment. Results showed that cell growth was slightly affected by the sulfide concentration, ethanol production was favored at higher sulfide concentrations, and acetic acid production was favored at lower sulfide concentrations.",

In biotechnology applications such as bioprocess development, SNPs may serve as genetic markers for phenotypes of interest such as those related to cell growth and viability, specific productivity, or stability. Furthermore, SNPs that relate to particular phenotypes may be targets for metabolic and cellular engineering. This review introduces study designs that have been used to link SNPs and phenotypes. The review then focuses on the downstream effects of the SNPs at DNA, RNA and protein levels. Finally, this review discusses specific examples to apply SNPs for breeding, strain evolution, and biomolecule production.

The values of the Michaelis constant Km of catalase were significantly smaller (ca. 2.5 times) upon immobilization, indicating increased affinity of the enzyme for its substrate, whereas Vmax value of free catalase was higher than that of the immobilized enzyme.

With this method oxygen concentration in the liquid phase is monitored after a sudden change of total pressure is applied to the system. With respect to the original technique introduced by Linek [14] the simplified version here proposed greatly simplifies the data treatment, yet resulting in good accuracy for most practical purposes. In practice, with the help of a simple mathematical model, it is found that the dynamic oxygen concentration response, when plotted as residual driving force versus time in a semi-log diagram, should be expected to finally settle on a straight line. From the slope of this last k L a can be immediately computed. Experimental data obtained on a lab-size stirred tank reactor confirm all model predictions, including the feature that the adoption of large pressure changes may lead to better accuracy. Mass transfer coefficient data obtained by means of the simplified dynamic pressure method (SDPM) here proposed are compared with the relevant data obtained on the same system by the most accurate physical technique (pure oxygen absorption in a pre-evacuated liquid), as well as with the literature data, resulting in SDPM full validation.

Crude palm oil (CPO), which is relatively cheaper because of avoiding refining cost, was used as the source of BD. CPO was first hydrolysed to fatty acids (FA), which was then esterified to BD. Candida rugosa and Novozym 435 lipases were used as biocatalysts for the hydrolysis of CPO and the esterification of FA, respectively. The complete conversion of CPO to FA was achieved under an optimal condition of buffer to CPO ratio 1:1 (v/v), buffer pH 7.0, lipase 0.1 wt.% of CPO, isooctane to CPO ratio 1:1 (v/v), temperature 30 °C, shaking speed 250 rpm and time 4 h.

The breakthrough curve for ALA, however, was well predicted only after increasing qm which indicates the occurrence of additional adsorption processes in the packed-bed relative to the batch system. An overshoot of the concentration of BLG in the bed exit stream observed experimentally in the two-component system, was only predicted after correcting the two isotherm parameters in order to account for the unexpected finding that the weakly bound ALA was able to displace the strongly bound BLG.

The correction factors employed for the pure binary mixture were used to simulate the breakthrough curves of the two proteins in experiments conducted with whey concentrate in each of the two stages of a novel separation process, and there was agreement between the experimental and theoretical results. These considerations should be helpful in developing a model compatible with the proposed mechanisms of adsorption for these two proteins.",

TCS was dosed into aeration tank with 0.05, 0.10 and 0.15 g every other day in three lab-scale OSA processes, respectively to form the TCS and OSA combined processes. The OSA and TCS combined processes reduced sludge yield by 21–56% under the same sludge retention time (6.75 h) in sludge anoxic holding tank. Substrate removal capability, effluent NH3-N concentrations and total phosphorus removal rates were not adversely affected by the presence of TCS or insertion of sludge anoxic holding tank, but total nitrogen removal rates only decreased significantly in the system with addition of 0.15 g TCS during the 60-day continuous operation. The settleability of sludge in four systems was qualitatively comparable and not significantly different. Microscopic examination and the banding patterns of DGGE profiles demonstrated that microbial population changed after TCS addition and insertion of anoxic sludge holding tank. The results suggest that TCS and OSA combined process is effective in reducing sludge yield, and process performance as well as sludge settleability are not significantly affected by introduction of the chemical uncoupler. The results imply that reduction of excess sludge production is due to uncoupled metabolism at low TCS dosage, but microbial death at high TCS dosage.",

Although the available information relates this phenomenon to purely biological aspects, it is contradictory with respect to tolerance levels, mechanisms and kinetics. This dispersion of results may be due to the empirical nature of the approaches which are based on batch cultures and fail to consider the conditions of aeration of the biomass.In the present work, the influence of Zn2+ in the range of 0–40 g/L is tested in continuous packed-bed bioreactors, by studying oxygen partial pressure and aeration flow rate as variables. Results show that when oxygen is the limiting reagent under identical aeration conditions, the bio-oxidation rate decreases by 0.8% per gram per litre of Zn2+. The cause of this result is purely thermodynamic; the solubility of oxygen in the medium decreases in equivalent proportions of the bio-oxidation rate owing to the salting-out effect.This finding leads to redesign of reactors for continuous ferrous iron bio-oxidation with the presence of Zn2+, whereby special attention is paid to the aeration system and its control during the operation.",

A one-variable-at-a-time method identified xylose (NH4)2SO4, and vitamins A and D as the optimum source of carbon, nitrogen, and growth-stimulating factor, respectively. Ammonium salts led to acidification of the culture medium, and the combination of (NH4)2SO4 with soybean steep liquor, the best organic nitrogen source, was therefore selected for subsequent optimization. Further experiments identified only xylose, soybean steep liquor and (NH4)2SO4 as having statistically significant effects on EPS production by a Plackett–Burman design. Re-optimization of these factors employed a path of steepest ascent approach followed by a central composite design modeling the response surface as a function of the experimental conditions. This predicted that optimum production of EPS would be achieved using a combination of xylose 31.27 g/l, soybean steep liquor 4.85 g/l, and (NH4)2SO4 0.15 g/l. Experimental validation revealed that the actual yield of EPS (43.87 ± 0.28 g/l) was accurately predicted by the model.

Increasing the hydrophobicity of the conjugate was found to decrease the biological efficacy including the levels of transgene expression and cellular viability. When the conjugate hydrophobicity was high enough to form micelles below 0.11 mg/mL, the reduction in transgene expression became moderated but was accompanied with a sharp decrease in cellular viability. On the other hand, when the conjugate hydrophobicity was decreased by conjugating PEG or cellobiose at the optimal % of around 1.2%, the level of transgene expression was enhanced while at the same time maintaining the cellular viability and the chemicophysical properties of the complexes.

It was found that these zeolites can quickly and almost completely adsorb 1-butanol from aqueous solutions containing ∼1 wt% of 1-butanol. The binding capacity of the zeolites appeared to be around 0.12 g 1-butanol/g zeolite, and remained constant till equilibrium concentration as low as 0.04 wt% 1-butanol in water. Extrudates were prepared and tested in a column set-up to get an impression of the suitability of these zeolites for industrial applications. Extrudates of 80% zeolite and 20% alumina binder with 16–24 mesh (0.7–1.0 mm) size showed the best adsorption results in a packed bed column with up-flow of ABE broth. The adsorbent loading at 10% breakthrough was calculated to be 0.085 g 1-butanol/g zeolite (9.3 min residence time). A subsequent temperature swing leads to desorption. By choosing the temperature program carefully, it was possible to separate the water/ethanol/acetone and 1-butanol fractions. The resulting 1-butanol concentration in the 1-butanol fraction was 84.3 wt% and thus a concentration factor of 65 was achieved in one step, which is a higher value compared to other isolation techniques. Only 80% of adsorbed 1-butanol could be recovered, the remainder could only be desorbed at higher temperatures as butene. However, this should not be a problem in an industrial process as all stronger binding, catalytic sites will be blocked after the first adsorption/desorption round. A mathematical model was developed to simulate the breakthrough data and a mass transfer coefficient (kpa) of 0.052 min−1 was obtained. Comparison of simulated kpa for different sizes of extrudates clearly indicated that the adsorption rate is determined by solid phase diffusion.",

Anthocyanins were released from skins during the early phases of the enzymatic treatments, but were then degraded during further enzymatic treatment; flavonols underwent transformation from glycosylated (rutin) to deglycosylated (quercetin) during the enzymatic treatment; phenolic acids, including hydroxybenzoic acids and hydroxycinnamic acids, were released as a function of monosaccharides liberation, i.e. as a function of the enzyme catalyzed cell wall degradation of the skins, and with some of the phenolic acids perhaps released from the lignin. The data moreover suggest that p-coumaric acid was also released during enzyme catalyzed degradation of acylated anthocyanins, probably as a result of cinnamate esterase activity. The data thus provided unexpected new clues as to how the enzymatic treatment with multicomponent pectinolytic enzymes may promote (a) discriminated release of phenols from grape skins, and (b) molecular changes in the phenols.",

The textural and surface properties of the surfactant modified barley straw (SMBS) were characterized by N2 adsorption, FT-IR, SEM, surface acidic/basic groups and surfactant desorption. The low desorption of CPC from SMBS demonstrated a strong bonding of the CPC to straw surface. Several factors such as adsorption temperature, solution pH, loading of adsorbent, and particle size on oil adsorption were investigated. It was found that addition of CPC created a non-polar layer on barley straw surface thus endowing SMBS with much better adsorption capacity for oil removal from water. The adsorption was found less favorable at high acidic condition and the maximum adsorption capacity was observed at about neutrality. Larger particle size would result in lower adsorption while adsorption temperature would not affect oil adsorption significantly. The kinetic study revealed that equilibrium time was short and the isotherm study indicated that the oil adsorption was fitted well by the Langmuir model.

     "abstract": "An unstructured model of hyaluronic acid (HA) fermentation by Streptococcus zooepidemicus considering the effect of glucose was proposed and validated. Experiments were performed in a glucose concentration range of 10–60 g l−1 in a 2 l bioreactor of batch mode. Three different models, namely, the Logistic equations for cell growth, the Logistic incorporated Leudeking–Piret-like equation for glucose consumption, and the Logistic incorporated Leudeking–Piret equation with time delay, Δt, for HA productions were proposed. The kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting the experimental data to the models. Simulation was made using the estimated kinetics parameter values and was compared with the experimental data. For glucose inhibition, S. zooepidemicus tolerated up to 40 g l−1 glucose. Beyond this concentration, cell growth was inhibited. The Han and Levenspiel model and the Teissier-type model gave the best fit for all the systems studied with R2 of 0.997 and 0.985, respectively.",

Statistical optimization was employed to optimize the culture medium for maximum mycelial growth and exo-polysaccharide (EPS) production in submerged fermentation: Plackett–Burman design (PBD) was applied to determine significant factors, followed by the paths of steepest ascent to move to the general vicinity of the optimum and Box–Behnken design (BBD) to obtain the final optimum culture medium composition. Glucose, yeast-powder and pH were significant for fermentation. 15.4 g glucose and 5.32 g yeast-powder per liter and pH 4.61 were optimum for the biomass accumulation from 2.75 g/l to 6.88 g/l, while 15.78 g glucose and 5.86 g yeast-powder per liter and pH 4.48 were optimum for EPS production from 0.214 g/l to 0.751 g/l. Under the optimized cultivation condition, cultivation kinetic models were studied in flask (pellet growth form) and airlift (filamentous growth form) reactors. The two morphologies resulted in different culture processes and mathematical models.",

     "abstract": "The commercial form of immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB), known as Novozym® 435, is a catalyst routinely used in enzymatic reactions. However, we observed a number of compounds migrated from this enzyme preparation into organic solvents and ionic liquids (ILs). These compounds were further identified by GC–MS analysis as a mixture of 17 substances, including 5 major components: glycerol, benzoic acid, 2-hydroxyethyl benzoate, 2-hydroxyethyl sorbate, and sorbic acid. The importance of this discovery is that all five major compounds are reactive in the presence of CALB, especially the last four compounds are potential acyl donors in enzymatic (trans)esterification reactions. We then quantified the migration of these acyl donors into various aqueous solutions, organic solvents and ILs, and observed that the migration into polar organic solvents and ILs was rapid (10–30 min). We also measured the reactivities of these acyl donors with 1-propanol in Novozym® 435-catalyzed (trans)esterifications. Our data suggest that the initial reaction rates of sorbic acid and sorbate ester were very fast; although the initial rates of benzoic acid and benzoate were much slower, their conversions into propyl benzoate were significant within 24 h period. The presence of these compounds in Novozym® 435 may not have considerable impact on fast reactions involving high substrate concentrations, however, it is important to realize that these trace compounds may affect the enzyme activity, and may cause confusion during the analysis of enzymatic reactions.",

When subjecting the AnSBR suspended sludge to heat-shock (80 °C for 20 min) and acidic pretreatment (pH 2.0 for 24 h) subsequently, granules were formed within the first 10 days of the AnSBR operation at pH 5.5. After subsequent second time heat-shock of the granules on day 35, hydrogen yield increased significantly to 1.36 mol-H2/mol-glucose with a headspace content of 65 ± 7% and was stable during the next 60 days running of the AnSBR. A typical mature HPG showed 1.7 ± 0.2 mm in diameter and had an average settling velocity of 43 m/h. The granules were comprised of uniform rod shaped bacteria with a non-layered structure and multiple cracks on the surface. Three pure cultures, Clostridium sp. HP2, HP4 and HP7, were obtained from the enriched HPGs. Among the three isolates, strain HP4 showed the highest hydrogen yield of 1.41 (mol-H2/mol-glucose) at a rate of 0.85 L-H2/L/day (34.5 mmol-H2/L/day). This study suggests that acid pretreatment, combining with the short settling time (30 min) and large exchange ratio (60%) of effluent, is applicable for rapid formation of HPGs in the AnSBR, which provides a promising approach for biological hydrogen production from the organic wastewater.",

The interfacial area was quantified using high speed photography and image analysis. Interfacial area correlated strongly with KLa over all agitation rates and alkane concentrations, suggesting that the interfacial area was the major factor defining KLa in these dispersions.The bubble diameter and gas hold up were identified as key parameters defining an optimal KLa at 5% alkane at agitation rates of 800–1200 rpm, through their impact on the interfacial area. Decreased bubble diameter and increased gas hold up with alkane addition from 2.5% to 5% resulted in increased interfacial area. However, a decreased gas hold up on alkane addition above 5% resulted in a correspondingly decreased interfacial area, despite the continued decline in bubble diameter. The decrease in bubble diameter and the decrease in gas hold up have in part been attributed to the reduction of surface tension from 26.0 to 17.7 and the doubling of viscosity to 2.0 mN/m respectively over the range of alkane concentrations examined.",

Various pretreatment processes were investigated, and 80 °C for 20 h by acid-hydrolysis was a suitable method considering the energy consumption. Pretreated wheat bran showed a better performance than that without treatment, especially for l-lactic acid yield (0.99 g/g). Moreover, when 25 g/l wheat bran hydrolysate was combined with 30 g/l corn steep liquor, the l-lactic acid fermentation efficiency (yield 0.99 g/g, productivity 3.75 g/l/h) was even higher than that of the control with 15 g/l yeast extract (yield 0.95 g/g, productivity 2.46 g/l/h). Although much more wheat bran hydrolysate and corn steep liquor were used than yeast extract in total amount, the cost of nitrogen in fermentation was estimated to be ¥1286/t l-lactic acid (25 g/l wheat bran hydrolysate and 30 g/l corn steep liquor), which is only 11% of the ¥11471/t l-lactic acid (15 g/l yeast extract) in control test. Therefore, nutrients of wheat bran hydrolysate and corn steep liquor could be employed to substitute yeast extract for l-lactic acid production.",

In this study, we developed a new technique for exquisite control of inner diameter (id) as well as outer diameter (od) of the microfibers using a coaxial triple cylinder. Aqueous solutions of dextran (core solution), sodium alginate (sample solution) and CaCl2 (sheath solution) were extruded simultaneously from the inner, intermediate and outer cylinders, respectively. The ratio of id to od could be controlled only by the ratio of flow volume of core solution to total flow volume of core and sample solutions (core volume ratio). The od depended on core volume ratio, flow velocities of core and sample solution at the tip of the intermediate cylinder, tip id of intermediate cylinder and flow velocity of sheath solution. Two types of mammalian cells could be separately located in the hollow core and the gel part of the microfibers. We confirmed that the cell-enclosing process scarcely influenced the viability of the enclosed cells. Although we did not perform long-term culture of the cell-enclosing microfibers in this study, these results indicate that our system has a high potential to fabricate biomimetic scaffold for tissue-engineered tubular tissues.",

Despite the advantages, native enzymes almost universally exhibit low activities and/or stabilities in the presence of organic solvents. This inactivation of the enzymes by organic solvents results in significant limitation of the enzymatic reaction process. Numerous attempts have been made to improve enzyme activity and stability in the presence of organic solvents using methods based on protein engineering and chemical or physical modification. Most enzymes used in these studies did not originally exhibit high activity and stability in the presence of organic solvents because they were not screened as organic solvent-tolerant enzymes. Recently, various attempts have been made to screen enzymes that naturally possess organic solvent-tolerance form various microorganisms including organic solvent-tolerant bacteria, thermophiles, halophiles and mesophiles. These organic solvent-tolerant enzymes are expected to have potential for applications in industrial chemical processes.",

In fact, ionic liquids can be designed with different cation and anion combinations, which allow the possibility of tailoring reaction solvents with specific desired properties, and these unconventional solvent properties of ionic liquids provide the opportunity to carry out many important biocatalytic reactions that are impossible in traditional solvents. As compared to those observed in conventional organic solvents, the use of enzymes in ionic liquids has presented many advantages such as high conversion rates, high enantioselectivity, better enzyme stability, as well as better recoverability and recyclability. To date, a wide range of pronounced approaches have been taken to further improve the performance of enzymes in ionic liquids. This review presents the recent technological developments in which the advantages of ionic liquids as a medium for enzymes have been gradually realized.",

The pathway of cysteine biosynthesis of archaea remains to be elucidated. From the characterization of cysteine synthase of hyperthermophilic archaea Aeropyrum pernix, new enzyme O-phosphoserine sulfhydrylase (OPSS; EC 2.5.1.65) which catalyzes the new reaction of synthesis of cysteine from O-phospho-l-serine and sulfide was found.

Development of hair follicles begins towards the end of the first trimester of pregnancy and is controlled by epidermal–mesenchymal interaction (EMI), which is a signaling cascade between epidermal and mesenchymal cell populations. Hair grows in cycles of various phases. Specifically, anagen is the growth phase, catagen is the involuting or regressing phase and telogen is the resting or quiescent phase. Alopecia is not life threatening, but alopecia often causes severe mental stress. In addition, the number of individuals afflicted by alopecia patients has been increasing steadily. Currently there are two methods employed to treat alopecia, drug or natural substance therapy and human hair transplantation. Although drug or natural substance therapy may retard the progress of alopecia or prevent future hair loss, it may also accelerate hair loss when the medication is stopped after prolonged use. Conversely, the transplantation of human hair involves taking plugs of natural hair from areas in which occipital hair is growing and transplanting them to bald areas. However, the number of hairs that can be transplanted is limited in that only three such operations can generally be performed. To overcome such problems, many researchers have attempted to revive hair follicles by culturing hair follicle cells or mesenchymal cells in vitro and then implanting them in the treatment area.",

While an obvious approach to treating these diseases is to simply replace the malfunctioning, damaged, or lost tissue, the need to immunosuppress recipients places them at increased risk of pathogenic infection and development of cancer. Limited availability of donor tissue is also problematic, and while xenogenic tissue could be used in some instances, immunosuppression alone is insufficient to prevent rejection. As an alternative, a physical barrier could be employed to mask the implanted tissue from immune surveillance at a local level, without the need for systemic immunosuppression. This approach is embodied through tissue microencapsulation. We review the underlying rationale of alginate based tissue microencapsulation technologies, current challenges, and possible solutions to these challenges in the form of a simple emulsion coating system incorporating functionalized alginate for local immunomodulation.",

     "abstract": "Flow cytometry (FC) is a powerful technique for the rapid analysis of single cells in a mixture, by means of light-scattering and fluorescence measurements. In biotechnology, the power of this method lies both in the possibility of determining a wide range of cell parameters at single cell level, and in the ability to obtain information about their distribution within cell populations, providing valuable information for bioprocess design and control. The first part of this review will be devoted to describe the basic aspects of multicolour FC, the different strategies used for cell detection, and the cellular target sites and fluorescent probes which are currently used in cell assays. Next, a deep revision concerning the most recent FC applications related to cell analysis and quantification (especially both bacteria and yeast) in food, drink and pharmaceutical industries and in natural environment and water systems is presented. This review seeks to highlight the advantages of this technique in microbial fermentations monitoring and control, as well as in the development of more accurate kinetic models directed to bioprocesses optimization. Finally, an overview of some commercial FC devices is presented along with a discussion of the progress and advantages of the method for bioprocesses on-line monitoring.",

     "abstract": "Adsorption on solid surface is of fundamental importance in the research and development of chromatographic science and technology. Due to the limitation of the currently available experimental approaches, molecular simulation, a research tool with sufficiently small scales in both time and space, has been used to explore the molecular insights into adsorption phenomena. This article offers an overview of the molecular simulation studies of adsorption on solid surfaces. First of all, various models of adsorbents used in different chromatographic modes are reviewed, including coarse-grained models and all-atom models, depending on the description precision required and the computational power provided. In the adsorbent models, the surface morphology is visualized using Monte Carlo simulation or molecular dynamics simulation. Then, studies on the adsorption and retention behaviors of small molecules by these models and methods are summarized. Finally, emphases are focused on the application of molecular simulation to protein adsorption, including protein–surface interaction, protein orientation and conformational transition on solid surfaces. In these studies, the effects of ligand parameters, including the ligand composition, ligand length, bonding density, ligand distribution have been examined. Meanwhile, chromatographic parameters, including the mobile phase composition and temperature, have also been investigated. Based on the successful applications reviewed herein, it is concluded that molecular simulation studies have contributed to the development of adsorption and chromatography in bioseparations. Moreover, it is suggested that molecular simulation combined with computational quantum chemistry and experiments would provide more comprehensive understanding of adsorption phenomena in the future.",

     "abstract": "The inactivation of hazardous microorganisms is an important subject for water treatment. While the most widely used methods in water treatment systems are chlorination, ozonation, and ultraviolet ray irradiation, the drawbacks of these techniques surpass their efficacy. The potential formation of carcinogenic chemical byproducts has been reported as a drawback of chemical disinfection methods, hence there is a need to develop some alternate disinfection techniques. Ultrasonic (US) irradiation is well known as a useful technique for microbial inactivation due to its chemical and physical factors. Our recent studies indicated that the presence of titanium dioxide (TiO2), known as a photocatalyst, accelerates the generation of hydroxyl (OH) radicals during US irradiation, and that the process is mediated through the induction of cavitation bubbles in irradiating solutions. This review describes a disinfection method that utilizes US irradiation of contaminated solution in the presence of TiO2, a so-called “sonocatalytic disinfection” method. The significant role of OH radicals in the mechanism of cell-killing is discussed.",

     "abstract": "Bacterial adhesion is the initial step in colonization and biofilm formation. Biofilms can, on the one hand, be detrimental to both human life and industrial processes, for example, causing infection, pathogen contamination, and slime formation, while on the other hand, be beneficial in environmental technologies and bioprocesses. For control and utilization of bacterial adhesion and biofilms, adhesion mechanisms must be elucidated. Conventional physicochemical approaches based on Lifshitz-van der Waals, electrostatic and acid–base interactions provide important models of bacterial adhesion but have a limited capacity to provide a complete understanding of the complex adhesion process of real bacterial cells. In conventional approaches, bacterial cells, whose surfaces are structurally and chemically heterogeneous, are often described from the viewpoint of their overall cellular properties. Cell appendages such as polysaccharide chains and proteinous nanofibers have an important function bridging between cells and the substratum in conventional adhesion models, but sometimes cause deviation from the models of cell adhesion. In reality, cell appendages are responsible for specific and nonspecific cell adhesion to biotic and abiotic surfaces. This paper reviews conventional physicochemical models and cell appendage-mediated cell adhesion. State-of-the-art technologies for controlling microbial adhesion and biofilm formation are also described. These technologies are based on the adhesion mechanisms.",

In this work, a novel cavern volume controlled culture model was proposed and applied to microbial HA production by batch culture of Streptococcus zooepidemicus. In the cavern model-controlled culture process, the complete mixing was achieved via the dynamic control of agitation speed in the range from 50 rpm to 470 rpm, and HA yield increased from 5.5 ± 0.1 g/L of the control to 6.2 ± 0.1 g/L. There was not significant influence of the model-controlled culture on the molecular weight of HA compared with the control, in which the agitation speed was kept at 294 rpm. With better mixing performance and improved oxygen mass transfer efficiency, the cavern volume controlled culture model may be helpful for the production of the other microbial biopolymers like xanthan gum, curdlan and poly(glutamic acid).",

     "abstract": "Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a linear high molecular weight glycosaminoglycan polymer with its molecular weight determining its physiological role, rheological properties and applications. The commercially used microbial source—Streptococcus zooepidemicus is incapable of synthesizing very high molecular weight polymer with low polydispersity, an essential niche in the HA market. In this organism, three important metabolic processes—glycolysis, hyaluronic acid synthesis and biomass formation compete for carbon source, nitrogen source, energy and precursors to determine the molecular weight of the synthesized polymer. After studying the role of culture conditions on these competing processes, it was found that the best strategy for enhancing molecular weight was to weaken the glycolytic process, strengthen HA synthesis process and maintain nitrogen under limiting condition to reduce the rate of biomass formation. Based on this newly developed strategy—temperature switches, addition of precursor N-acetylglucosamine and addition of pyruvate experiments enhanced the molecular weight of the polymer by 23%, 74% and 64%, respectively. Improving precursor levels, particularly UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and thereby strengthening the HA flux plays a direct role in improving molecular weight of hyaluronic acid.",

     "abstract": "The fermentation of syngas (CO, CO2, and H2) produced from biomass gasification for the production of ethanol has received increased attention due to the low cost and abundance of cellulosic feedstocks. Since CO plays a critical role in the available reducing equivalents and carbon conversion, this work assessed the effects of constant CO partial pressure (PCO), ranging from 0.35 to 2.0 atm, on cell growth, acetic acid production, and ethanol production using Clostridium carboxidivorans P7T. Several key findings included: (a) the maximum cell concentration increased with increasing PCO, increasing 440% with a PCO increase from 0.35 to 2.0 atm, (b) ethanol production changed from non-growth-associated to growth-associated with increasing PCO, (c) acetic acid production (gram acetic acid per gram cells) decreased for PCO ≥ 1.05 atm relative to PCO ≤ 0.70 atm, and (d) acetic acid appeared to be converted in the latter growth stages for PCO of 1.35 and 2.0 atm. Several explanations point to the potential importance of PCO and the PCO to P C O 2 ratio on electron and ATP production. Since gasification processes that generate syngas could result in differing gas partial pressures, process variations could significantly change growth and product formation as evidenced by metabolic changes observed in this work due to changing PCO and/or the PCO to P C O 2 ratio.",

In this process, 70% of the initial whey lactose was biodegraded during 24 h of incubation time. Biodegradation was accompanied with a turnover of glucose intermediate and a production of lactic acid. Total lactic acid produced by this recombinant strain was 57.8 mmol/L compared with a reference lactic acid producing strain, Lactobacillus acidophilus, that yielded only 55.3 mmol/L of lactic acid from the same initial whey lactose concentration. The engineering of vgb gene transformation in E. coli strain has led to increase in bacterial biomass and boosted lactic acid production, relative to other strains that lack the vgb gene like E. coli:pUC9 or E. coli wild type or Enterobacter aerogenes. Contrary to Monod's, Haldane's model gave a good fit to the growth kinetics data. Kinetic constants of the Haldane equation were μm = 0.5573 h−1, Ks = 4.8812 g/L, KI = 53.897 g/L. Biomass growth was well described by the logistic equation while Luedeking–Piret equation defined the product formation kinetics.

We explore classical operation, in which air is blown unidirectionally through a substrate bed that remains immobile, with two strategies that involve movement of the layers. The first strategy involves batch operation, in which the positions of the layers are changed at 1 h intervals, in a cycling motion. The second strategy involves continuous plug-flow of the layers, with the regular addition of new layers at the air outlet and removal of spent layers at the air inlet. Under the conditions of the simulation, the rate of metabolic heat generation during the steady state of the continuous plug-flow process is only 60% of the peak value predicted for classical operation. As a result, the maximum bed temperature in the continuous plug-flow process is 4.5 °C lower than that predicted for classical operation. We conclude that the operation of multi-layer packed beds in the continuous plug-flow mode can improve bioreactor performance significantly.",

Recombinant L-selectin-Fcγ is widely used both as a tool to study this key step of inflammation and as an anti-inflammatory compound in animal models of inflammation. Since previous studies on cellular L-selectin have indicated that glycosylation influences adhesive interactions of the adhesion molecule, we have examined whether the binding activity of L-selectin-Fcγ is affected by sialylation. Different forms of recombinant human L-selectin-Fcγ were expressed in CHO and K-562 cells and were purified by affinity chromatography using Protein A-Sepharose. A hypersialylated form of L-selectin-Fcγ was generated by culturing cells in the presence of 5 mM N-acetyl-beta-d-mannosamine, while a desialylated variant was obtained by treatment of purified L-selectin-Fcγ with neuraminidase. Binding activity to the synthetic biligand SiaLex-PAA-sTyr was measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. While hypersialylated L-selectin-Fcγ showed decreased binding activity, desialylation elevated L-selectin-Fcγ binding to SiaLex-PAA-sTyr. The data show that sialylation of L-selectin-Fcγ reduces binding activity to ligand epitopes containing sialyl Lewis x and sulfated tyrosine residues.

     "abstract": "A high amylase producing Bacillus subtilis WD 161 was used in a co-culture with Clostridium butylicum TISTR 1032 to enhance acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) production from starch. The mixed culture of C. butylicum TISTR 1032 and B. subtilis WD 161 without anaerobic pretreatment by reducing agent and N2 flushing increased amylase activity 10 folds and enhanced ABE production 5.4 and 6.5 folds from soluble starch and cassava starch, respectively, compared to those of the pure culture of Clostridium itself. The medium optimization for ABE production by the mixed culture without anaerobic pretreatment found that cassava starch concentration of 40 g/L, C/N ratio of 4.35 and the mixed nitrogen sources of 265 mM yeast extract and 100 mM NH4NO3 gave the highest ABE production in terms of final concentration and productivity. The benefits of using this high amylase producing aerobic Bacillus in a co-culture with anaerobic Clostridium were not only increasing substrate utilization and ABE production but there was also no requirement to add any costly reducing agent to the medium or flushing with N2 to ensure anaerobic condition. This thus makes the anaerobic fermentation more economical and cost effective. This co-culture system may contribute greatly to developing industrialized ABE production.",
