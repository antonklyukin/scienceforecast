     "abstract": "Peanut oil was used as a carbon source for the production of films of a novel polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) intended for applications as biodegradable packaging for the food industry. Cupriavidus necator was used in a two-stage production system. In the first stage, bacterial growth was favored and, in the second, PHA was synthesized. The use of 2% (v/v) vegetable oil, rich in saturated fatty acids, allowed a yield of 0.7 g of PHA per g of peanut oil. A heteropolymer of PHA was obtained composed of 98.2 mol% of 3-hydroxybutyrate, 0.75 mol% of 3-hydroxyvalerate and, 1 mol% of medium-length-chain hydroxyalkanoate (HA). The synthesized PHA exhibited a decrease in the melting temperature and an increase in elongation at break in comparison with homopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). The water vapour permeability of the PHA film was similar to that of polyethylene terephthalate films. Moreover, the biodegradation in soil of the PHA film was demonstrated exhibiting a weight lost of 75% after 80 days. The properties exhibited by the PHA films could make possible its applications in the food packaging and in the biotechnology industry.",

     "abstract": "The mucilage obtained from Plantago seeds is a promising raw material for producing edible films or coatings; however, its complete separation from the seeds is rather difficult. To avoid the difficulties of the extraction and taking advantage of the strong interfacial interactions between the seed husk and the mucilage, we examined the possibility of preparing edible biocomposite films directly from psyllium husk and husk flour. The results showed the husk and husk flour are both suitable for film formation. To reduce the brittleness of the films, two plasticizers, glycerol and poly(ethylene glycol) (Mw = 400 g/mol) were used and both plasticizers improved the flexibility of the films. According to the tensile test, the particles acted as reinforcements in the polysaccharide matrix. ATR-FTIR, solubility, water vapor absorption and water vapor permeability tests were conducted to further examine the interactions of the components and the hydrophilic nature of the films. The tests revealed that biocomposite films directly obtained from psyllium seed husk and husk flour can be novel edible films for the food and food packaging industry.",

     "abstract": "As a preliminary step for optimizing the active scavenger system to confer both the proper level of carbonic product taste and the tolerable package appearance for flexible packages of kimchi, a Korean lactic acid-fermented vegetable, a mathematical model to estimate their volume change along with internal CO2 concentration was developed. Kinetics of acidity increase and CO2 production was determined by experiment of storing glass jars of 0.5 kg kimchi at 0, 10 and 20 °C. Scavenger’s CO2 absorption kinetics was formulated as gas permeation of the film sachet of Ca(OH)2. All the kinetics was combined into mass balance of CO2 where its dissolution equilibration between the product and headspace phases was described by Henry’s law. Temperature dependence of the kinetic parameters was explained by Arrhenius equation. Thermodynamic temperature effect was incorporated by Ideal Gas Law and Henry’s law constant. The developed model could estimate the behavior of a flexible package of 0.5 kg kimchi with a CO2 scavenger sachet at 5 °C and assist in the design of kimchi packages that adopt tolerable volume expansion while maintaining a desirable CO2 level for carbonic fresh flavor. The sachet film’s CO2 permeability and the active scavenger amount in the sachet were design variables affecting the volume expansion and CO2 partial pressure. Among the tested conditions, high-density polyethylene sachet of 5.5 g scavenger was the best in providing the desired characteristics.",

UV–vis spectral was detected peaks in the area of AgNPs formation and High Resolution Transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed that formation of nearly spherical AgNPs with an average size of 5 to 18 nm. All AgNPs had activity against the examined pathogenic bacteria reached to 10 folds more than the normal form of poly-phenolics. Also, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were ranged between 16.7 and 46.7 μg ml−1. The films of CA-nanocomposite were prepared by phase inversion technique. The obtained films were characterized by FTIR, SEM, EDX techniques and their swelling properties were determined. Also, antibacterial activity of the film was assessed. CA-nanocomposite had high antibacterial activity against St. aureus, B. cereus, S. typhi, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and low activity against the two strains of Pseudomonase spp. All tested immersed films showed no toxic effect against larvae even used quercetin in the preparation (<18% mortality). The released amount of Ag nanoparticles from different CA-nano-composite films was also less than the allowable limit. The current work conclude that the poly-phenolic CA -Ag nano-composite films had strong antibacterial activity with nontoxic effect, which increases the possibility of applying it as an active food packaging system.",

A full factorial design was employed to assess three independent variables (MP, chitosan, and plasticizer concentrations) and three dependent variables (tensile strength, elongation, and water vapor permeability). The experimental design results indicated the best conditions to prepare the film were 1.3% (m/v) MP, 30% (m/m) chitosan, and 40% glycerol (m/m). The control film was prepared with 1.3% (m/v) MP and 40% glycerol (m/m). Adding chitosan increased the viscosity of the solution and the elongation, but reduced solubility and swelling by 66,43% and 74,56%, respectively. The optimized film tended to have an opaque structure with excellent UV-barrier properties.

Nevertheless, their post-metalliser conversion to the final packaging material still presents challenges to current AlOₓ producers and the wider converting industry. In this work, AlOₓ coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films have been converted in long duration industrial-scale trials via topcoating, printing, lamination and finally pouch making. Throughout this process, each conversion step has been investigated for its effects on the barrier performance. It was found that the printing processes, especially, induce significant damage to the ceramic barrier layer. However, by the use of a protective topcoat prior to any conversion step, the barrier properties of the AlOₓ coated film were preserved, or could even be significantly enhanced, depending on the topcoat material. Furthermore, for a barrier topcoat, remarkable stretch- and flex-durability properties were achieved in the final laminate.",

     "abstract": "The release of graphene from graphene-polyethylene composite films involving 1.5 wt% graphene into various food simulants under different temperature and time conditions is studied in this paper. A simple and quick method, which only requires ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, to quantize the total amount of released graphene is developed. Meanwhile, the morphology and size of releases into food simulants are characterized by TEM and laser particle size analysis. The results reveal that the graphene in graphene-polyethylene composite films, which are released into food simulants mostly occurs at the interface rather than “supposed” migrates from the interior of composite films. This is because graphene clusters or graphene-containing polymer flakes, which are located at the outer surface, are easily pulled off, while the size much less than the interspace between polymers is the precondition for graphene migrating from the interior. Various factors in terms of specific surface area, ethanol concentration, temperature and experiment period are investigated to show their influences on the release of graphene. Among all the case studies, the maximum amount of graphene release is found to be 1.6 mg/kg.",

These packages require venting to maintain adequate cooling within the package, however, the presence and configuration of the ventilation openings could compromise its strength. This study aimed at evaluating the performance of ventilated packages by considering the influence of different geometrical configurations of vents. The compression strength of four package designs, each for three vent area (2%, 4%, and 8%) and three corrugated paperboard grade (B-, C- and BC-flute boards) were quantified experimentally and results were compared with finite element simulations. A negative and almost linear relationship was found between compression strength and vent area. Packages with BC-flute and B-flute board grade had the greatest and lowest compression strength, respectively, with percentage reduction as high as 72% for 2% vent area, 65% for 4% vent area and 67% for 8% vent area. The study also demonstrated that the functionality of package vent hole design is tied strongly to the properties of the chosen board grade. The Edge and Standard vent package designs performed best compared to the Alt and Multi vent package designs. Numerical results and experimental results were in good agreement, within 10%. The width side of the package was more resistant to buckling while buckling originated from the centre of the length side of the package. From the contact FEA model, irrespective of the package design, maximum stress was observed to be concentrated at the corners of the package.",

The shape of the relationship does not depend on the composition of model liquid (aqueous solutions of ethanol) used in the measurements. Extensive research proves that the observed effect is connected with the change of mass transfer resistance of the photoinitiator between the varnish layer and the model liquid resulting from the change of surface roughness caused by and dependent on a dose of UV radiation.",

Incorporation of eugenol (EUG), carvacrol (CAR), and thymol (THY) into films at ≥ 1% (w/w) eliminated the typical brittleness of zein films. However, EUG outperformed CAR and THY in terms of mechanical properties. Films with ≥ 2% (w/w) CAR and THY and ≥ 3% EUG showed clear zones against L. innocua and E. coli in agar medium at 37 °C. All EO-containing films also inhibited L. innocua and E. coli inoculated at their surfaces by minimum 3.9 and 2.7 decimal (D) within 1 day at 10 °C. Moreover, 2% EUG-containing zein coatings caused 2–3 decimal reduction in L. innocua and E. coli counts of inoculated melon surfaces at 10 °C. Unlike the bare zein coatings, flexible EUG-containing films on melons did not show cracking or detachment. Zein films loaded with EUG showed a highly hydrophilic surface. The best oxygen barrier performance was observed for the EUG-richest formulation (i.e., EUG at 3%), and this was attributed to a homogenizing effect of the EO that eventually led to a denser and hole-free network. This work suggested that flexible coatings of zein containing EOs could inhibit pathogens embedded in the rough peel surface of melons.",

Physico-chemical (thickness, oxygen and water vapour permeability, solubility and moisture content) and antioxidant film properties and activities were determined. Adjustments in film formulations and quantity of plasticizer were done in order to obtain smooth films that are easy to manipulate and without cracks and mechanical failures. The extract of blueberry had higher levels of total phenolics, however films had lower antioxidant activity compared to red grape skin extracts, and the CMC resulted in more active films in the three concentrations of bioactives incorporation tested. On the other hand, with the extract of grape skin that had lower content of total phenolics, the films presented greater antioxidant activity, and the CS matrix, in general, showed more active efficacy. Both matrices showed antioxidant activities directly proportional to total phenolic contents incorporated into the films, being more effective those of CS containing 4% red grape skin pomace extract. The addition of red grape skin extracts increased oxygen permeability for 3 orders of magnitude in CMC films while it didn’t influence OTR in CS films expect for 4% extract.

Despite their benefits, the stability and functionality of ZnO-NPs could be altered when they come into contact with foodstuff through migration. Hence, we investigated Zn migration and its effect on the functional properties of low density polyethylene (LDPE)-ZnO nanocomposite films. The migration of Zn from nanocomposite films into food simulants (distilled water, 4% acetic acid (w/v), 50% ethanol (v/v) and n-heptane) was conducted at 70 °C for 30 min according to the Korea standard and specifications for food utensils, containers and packages conditions. The presence of Zn in the food simulants was verified by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. Different concentrations of dissolved Zn were observed ranging from 0.006 to 3.416 mg L−1 (except for heptane) and the level of migrated Zn was found as a function of the ZnO-NPs content in the nanocomposite film. However, the highest amount of migrated Zn measured in this study was lower than the specific migration limit regulated by the European Commission. In addition, the UV light absorption and the antimicrobial activity of the LDPE-ZnO nanocomposite film were significantly affected by the dissolution of ZnO, particularly in acetic acid. Therefore, particular attention is requested to use when LDPE-ZnO nanocomposite films are used for food packaging, especially acidic food, because Zn can likely migrate, and thereby their UV blocking and antimicrobial functions could be no longer effective.",

FT-IR analysis of the blends showed the formation of new interactions and structures, while morphology analysis indicated a possible compatibility between the polymers. The addition of 30% of PVOH provided a more ductile material, increasing nine times the WPI elongation capability, leading to tensile properties close to that from commercial LPDE.

Thus, the application of HAE as a natural pH indicator with visible colour variation incorporated into renewable materials to allow for simple, economic, and easy disposal, can be considered an invocation in the area of intelligent packaging system. Films containing HAE (25 g/100 g of filmogenic dispersion, intelligent films) were produced by casting using 2 g of starch, gelatin or chitosan/100 g of filmogenic dispersion and 30 g of sorbitol/100 g of macromolecules. These films were characterized by the colour change at different pH values (from 2.2 to 8.0 and 13.0), water content, total soluble matter, light barrier properties and morphological structure. Intelligent films presented homogeneous surfaces without visible defects. The colour variation of intelligent films was visibly observed and completely dependent on pH. This was associated with the presence of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds in HAE. The addition of HAE in the films provoked a significant increase in the water content. A significant increase was observed only for the starch film for total soluble matter. The gelatin films presented a barrier to light. The proposed device could be used as an alternative natural pH indicator in intelligent packaging systems.",

However, the hydrophilic nature and relatively weak mechanical properties is a major hurdle to its commercial application. In this study, Ultra-violet (UV) irradiation based cross-linking was investigated for its effect on the mechanical properties of TPS films plasticized by boric acid, and glycerol. Spray dried amorphous powder was compressed to obtained TPS films. All the samples were amorphous under dry conditions (RH0%) while retro-gradation was resisted at the relative humidity (RH) of50% and 100% for all the films. The concentration of the plasticizers influenced the moisture uptake ability of TPS films. UV irradiation showed no effect on the crystallinity of TPS films. However, it enhanced the mechanical strength and lessened the solubility and degree of swelling. Boric acid plasticized and co-plasticized samples revealed improved mechanical properties before and after UV irradiation compared to glycerol but showed more moisture sensitivity before cross-linking. The UV irradiated starch with 30% boric acid as plasticizer (30BA.UV.PS) showed highest tensile strength (4.28 MPa) among all the samples at 50% relative humidity. Moreover, the strain at break of the same sample decreased from 12.53% to 9.12% at 50% relative humidity.",

Active and control films were characterized. The incorporation of the active fractions did not significantly affect the density, moisture content, water vapor permeability and puncture strength of films. Solubility, color and opacity were dependent on the fraction incorporated into the films. Activated films maintain the antilisterial activity until 45 days of evaluation. Also, active and control triticale films were used to obtain heat-sealed pouches to package inoculated cheese slices under controlled conditions. Active triticale packaging could reduce the counts of Listeria in 3 log comparing to control after 15 days of storage. These results suggest that triticale flour films activated with this BLIS could provide an alternative strategy for active food packaging applications.",

Compared to 10.05% weight loss in uncoated pods (control), PLW in ASNE and ATNE was recorded as 7.38% and 8.32% respectively after 4 days of cold storage. Increase in L* value during storage was 26.39% for control pods compared to 14.98% in coated pods. a* value and browning index revealed better effectiveness of ASNE coating for colour retention during storage. Developed formulations were found effective against spoilage fungi Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus flavus. Effective concentration for 50% inhibition of pathogens was determined using probit analysis. EC50 values were lower for sapindus emulsified basil oil over Tween 20 based nano-emulsion. In vivo trials on okra inoculated with Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus flavus yielded promising results. Thus alginate coating with basil oil nano-emulsified with Sapindus extract can emerge as a promising non-chemical approach towards extending postharvest quality and shelf life of okra.",

RE compounds interact with PVA, favoring the retention of polyphenols (88 ± 2%), and improving its thermal stability. The components extracted from PVA/Ros mat were the same as those of the RE. PVA/Ros mats showed a polyphenol content of (15.4 ± 0.5) mg gallic acid equivalent/g of mat (mg GAE/g) and achieved an antioxidant activity of (120 ± 8) μmoles Trolox equivalent/g of mat (μmol TE/g), as measured by Folin-Ciocalteu method and DPPH assay. The release rate of rosemary polyphenols to several food simulants was measured and kinetic data was adjusted by Fick’s diffusion law, Power Law, and Weibull model. The resulting parameters suggested that polymer chain relaxation is the leading mechanism in hydrophilic simulant, while an anomalous release occurred in acid medium.

The VOC release profiles in raw, minced pork packaged under modified atmosphere (70% O2, 30% CO2) stored at 4 °C were measured on days 0, 3, 6, and 12 of storage by proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS). Additional sensory and solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry/olfactometry (SPME-GC–MS/O) analyses of sample subsets allowed for a comparison of VOC profile changes with changes in sensory impressions and aided compound identification. Alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and acids were observed to change over time, either increasing continuously or decreasing after reaching maximum concentrations early to mid-way during storage. Marked differences were observed in the concentrations of several compounds between the fresh (day 0) and aged samples (day 12). Sensory analyses indicated strong increases in buttery and greasy odours, moderate increases in cheesy, vomit-like, sweaty and sour-cream-like odours, and decreases in fruity odours. The number of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonads, psychrotrophs, mesophiles, yeasts and moulds increased throughout storage. Percentage wise, LAB dominated the microbial population at each sampling point and pH decreased during storage. Values of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) indicated marginal lipid oxidation during the first week of storage. The present study provides useful information on the development of characteristic volatile spoilage compounds and offers insights for the potential future implementation of specific sensors to monitor shelf-life.",

This work reports on the encapsulation of neem seed oil extract within three different polymeric shells: polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), gum arabic (GA) and whey protein isolate/maltodextrin (WPI/MD), using spray drying. The obtained, roughly spherical microcapsules had average sizes of 28.84 ± 11.86 μm, 32.43 ± 13.06 μm, and 52.88 ± 17.33 μm (obtained from PVA, GA, and WPI/MD, respectively). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the presence of the core and shell components, in addition to surface functional groups. Encapsulation efficiencies for neem seed oil proved higher in smaller microcapsules, although efficiency values of 60–92% were obtained in all cases. In vitro release of neem seed oil from the microcapsules followed the Ritger–Peppas model, as governed by Fickian diffusion. From these results, the association of botanical insecticides within biopolymer cores offer considerable potential for increasing agricultural production levels, and reducing impacts on the environment and human health.",

Vacuum-packaged saithe stand out negatively with highest DL and reduced sensory shelf life and physiochemical and microbial quality. It was moreover found that increased drip loss, and higher contents of hypoxanthine and cadaverine in the muscle tissue was related to the microbiological ecology (i.e. increased growth of Shewanella spp. and Photobacterium spp.).",

After assessing several different polymers, microcrystalline cellulose was chosen as the absorbent matrix due to its high level of absorption, around 90% of its weight. Carvacrol and TTO were released into the head compartment in a controlled manner, reaching a plateau within 20 min. Both carvacrol and TTO patches exhibited marked antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Alternaria alternate, Penicillium commune and moderate activity against Pseudomonas putida. Visual and mechanical evaluation of strawberries and pumpkin specimens showed that carvacrol patches had the best effect on increasing shelf life compared to TTO and empty patches. The versatility of the patch, the simplicity of its production and its effectiveness demonstrated here make it very attractive as a new platform to extend the shelf life of fresh foods.",

Our results show that cork percentage per se provides insufficient information on the mechanical behaviour of a cork-based stopper. Cork percentage together with stopper density is a better indicator of the mechanical behaviour of a micro-agglomerated cork stopper, and that mechanical behavior depends more on cork content than on binder content.

Oxygen permeability and water vapor permeability of 1% OT-PLA were reduced by 29% and 26% compared to PLA. Flexibility of OT-PLA was higher than T-PLA, and Young’s modulus of OT-PLA was lower than T-PLA or PLA. OT-PLA had higher transparency than T-PLA but provided better light blocking in UVA and UVB regions than PLA. TiO2 modification with oleic acid improved dispersion of TiO2 in the PLA.

Another method is based on water vapour sorption measurements which is a non-steady-state method. It can be used only for mono-material flat bodies. It allows using smaller sample areas compared to permeation measurements. However, not much is known about how well both methods correlate with each other. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the WVTR results of different materials determined by both methods. The results of both methods differed by up to factor of three, measured at identical samples. In a few cases the difference was up to factor five. The exact reasons for these differences are unknown. Nonetheless, the water vapour sorption method is a suitable method to determine the magnitue of order of the water vapour transmission rate but not its exact value.",

In particular, the cheeses wrapped in paraffin showed the highest pH value while those packaged using MAP showed the highest aw. The vacuum-packed VdB cheeses were characterised by the highest lightness (L*) value. The cheeses covered with paraffin reached the lowest scores at sensory evaluation, probably because they were characterised by the highest concentrations of the free fatty acids responsible for bitter flavours.",

The label comprises a plastic film colorimetric CO2 indicator layer encapsulated in a polymer sheath, the permeability of which controls the rate of diffusion of the CO2 in to and out of the indicator film. The CO2 sensitive indicator film inside the label is relatively fast in responding (recovering its original colour in 26 min at 25 °C) when the ambient atmosphere is changed from that of the MAPed package (containing 25% CO2) to air, but when encapsulated in the polymer sheath used in the AOF label, which uses polyethylene terephthalate, PET, as a gas diffusion barrier, under the same conditions its recovery time is ca. 30 h (at 25 °C). Key to its commercial function – as a consume within indicator – at 5 °C, the label’s recovery time is ca. 96 h (i.e. 4 days). While UV/Vis spectrophotometry is used to characterise the optically transparent CO2 indicator, photography, coupled with digital image colour analysis is used to characterise the AOF label. A study of the kinetics of colour recovery of the AOF label as a function of temperature revealed an activation energy, Ea, of colour recovery of ca. 43 kJ mol−1, which is similar to a number of different food spoilage processes. The potential of the AOF label as a ‘consume within’ indicator to help minimise the large amount of unnecessary household food waste associated with many developed countries is discussed briefly.",

This work investigated the effects of diffusion controlled release of tocopherol on inhibiting oxidation of linoleic acid. The results show that diffusion controlled release is more effective than constant rate release and instant addition, probably because the rate of diffusion controlled release of tocopherol more closely matches the rate of formulation of free radicals by linoleic acid.

The total oligomer content in the polyesters was determined with LC-UV using the cyclic PET trimer as external standard and was found to be 0.81% for PEN and 0.34% for PBT. Migration of PBT oligomers was studied into 20% ethanol (v/v) at 40 °C and 60 °C and the diffusion coefficients thus derived were compared to theoretically determined ones. To estimate the PEN and PBT oligomer migration at 23 °C under long time storage conditions the diffusion coefficients were calculated using the approaches by Welle and Piringer. For cyclic PBT oligomers the Welle model underestimates the migration, for one linear PBT oligomer the Piringer model might be suitable to determine the migration.

In this study, an integrated mathematical model is proposed to represent the transport of water in an active packaging system with a moisture adsorber. For this, suitable equations were used to represent the different processes involved: a first-order kinetics and a Freundlich equilibrium equation were used to represent the adsorption from the active element. The product transpiration was represented by considering its heat of respiration and the difference in water concentration between the product and the packaging headspace surrounding it. Likewise, the differential equations of mass balance for O2, CO2, N2 and water vapor were established for the active packaging. For the moisture adsorption, a mixture of sodium polyacrylate (SPA) and cotton in ‘sachets’ of porous vegetable paper (70% SPA w/w) was used as adsorber determining its capacity and rate of adsorption as a function of relative humidity and temperature. To validate the proposed model, ‘Hass’ avocado samples were stored in rigid perforated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) packages for 12 days at 12 °C. With the model it was possible to satisfactorily represent the accumulation of moisture in the package, the amount of water adsorbed by the adsorber and the weight loss of the packaged avocado fruits (R2 = 0.97–0.99 for the different tests).",

     "abstract": "Whey protein isolate (WPI) based films containing emulsions and nano-emulsions of Grammosciadium ptrocarpum Bioss. essential oil (GEO) (0.5, 1 and 1.5% of WPI) were investigated. The formation of new interactions between WPI and GEO nano-droplets was confirmed by FT-IR. According to XRD results, the crystalline nature of the film was completely preserved by GEO addition. The FE-SEM images revealed that the incorporation of GEO nano-emulsions would improve the film integrity. The nano-emulsion incorporation improved the mechanical properties and caused to decrease water vapor permeability (WVP) (3.5 × 10−7 g/m.s.Pa to 3.21 × 10−7 g/m.s.Pa and 4.10 × 10−7 g/m.s.Pa to 3.92 × 10−7 g/m.s.Pa for concentrations of 0.5 and 1.5% respectively). The antioxidant potential (20.86% for nano-emulsion of 1% compared to 16.80% of 1% emulsion) and antimicrobial activity of the films containing GEO nano-emulsions was higher than emulsion incorporated films. Based on release studies, the release rate of GEO in water was increased by decreasing droplet size. The results showed a potential of WPI-GEO nano-active films for novel food protection.",

In this work, KS was incorporated in rennet casein sheets containing waxes (beeswax, candelilla and carnauba waxes) and its release and antimicrobial potential against Escherichia coli were analysed. KS was studied at 15 °C for its antimicrobial properties against Escherichia coli ATCC 10536. 15 °C is a non-common incubation temperature for E. coli but is often used for food storage of cheeses (in ripening cellars) or dry foods for example. Waxes are well studied blended to hydrocolloids to make coatings or films by solvent casting method but the novelty of this work is the use of a twin screw extruder to produce films. Morphological, barrier, tensile and antimicrobial properties were compared for casein/wax blends material produced by twin screw extrusion.The presence of KS significantly inhibits E. coli and that even at low concentration and even after 20 days at 15 °C, which suggests effect of casein matrix as preservative carrier. Besides, a plasticizing action of KS was demonstrated at 10% addition on mechanical properties (decrease of TS and increase of %E) and on water barrier properties. Concerning water vapor permeability, only beeswax among waxes introduced in sheets was efficient to reduce WVP (by 20%). No significant impact on sheet color parameters was observed especially due to wax addition.Finally, the work provided here might help researches on edible biopolymer as preservative carriers that can be produced by an easily industrial process (twin screw extrusion).",

This article reviews the recent developments in DCA technology for storage of apples. The effects of DCA on physiological disorders, physico-chemical and sensory quality are discussed. Moreover, negative effects associated with DCA technology are also discussed. The study has shown that DCA maintains apple postharvest quality by reducing respiration rate and ethylene production. Ethylene-mediated physiological disorders such as superficial scald are completely suppressed by DCA storage. However, the effect of DCA on bitter pit incidence needs further investigation. The review also showed that fruit firmness and colour retention is considerable high in DCA stored apples. Although DCA maintains both the physico-chemical and organoleptic quality of apples, the high risk of CO2 and low O2 injury in DCA stored fruit remains a concern. Further research is required to refine and improve the DCA technology in order to minimize the risk of CO2 and low O2 injury during longterm storage.",

Recent studies have shown that lower concentrations can achieve the same inhibitory effect as instant addition if antimicrobials are added in a time-release manner. However, the effect of combined mode (i.e., instant addition plus time release) has not been studied. The objective of this work is to compare the effects of thymol via three delivery modes (instant addition, time release, and combined mode) on microbial inhibition of Escherichia coli DH5α. The results showed that via time-release and combined mode, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of thymol were lowered by 25% and 50% respectively, as compared to instant addition.

Blended films were elaborated using WPI and four concentrations of PEC. Interaction between WPI and PEC was evaluated through ζ-potential. Solubility, moisture sorption behavior, optical, barrier and mechanical properties and microstructure of films were evaluated. The results showed that PEC electrostatically interacted with WPI at pH 3.0, reducing the ζ-potential to values close to zero. The interaction between compounds increased the opacity, solubility and permeability to water vapor, but decreased the flexibility and tensile strength of WPI films. With the increase of pectin concentration, the electrostatic interaction was reduced and the non-complex pectin that, was present in excess, improved the mechanical properties of films.",

This contributes significantly to postharvest quality loss because of resultant mass loss, shrivelling, poor eating quality and short shelf life, which are the critical parameters determining the competitiveness of fresh produce in the market. One of the successful techniques used to alleviate water loss of fresh produce is the application of coatings immediately after harvesting. This technique has been successful not only in reducing water loss and delaying senescence but also in increasing the antimicrobial properties of the coated produce. Recently, some substances included in coatings formulations are criticised due to their negative residual effects on consumers, high potential to form an impermeable layer whilst some are prohibited on organic produce. The development of coatings from edible substances is the latest technology intended for safe maintenance and improvement of produce quality at postharvest. The application of edible coatings based on plant extracts (ECPE) on horticultural produce can provide extensive relief to consumers. The use of ECPE stands high chances of increasing consumer confidence because they can be completely organic. This review looks at the maintenance of postharvest quality by application of ECPE on fresh produce. Recent advances in the formulation and application of ECPE are discussed. Furthermore, this review makes recommendations for formulations that could be very valuable in future whilst assisting future research, development of legislation and functionality of ECPE.",

Varying concentrations (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25%, w/w) of rice flour were added to chicken skin gelatin films using casting technique. The results show that the addition of rice flour increased the water vapor permeability while decreasing film solubility (p < 0.05). Furthermore, ultraviolet and visible light transmission decreased with the transparency of films increased (p < 0.05) while thermal properties (Tm) increased with the concentration increased. The surface of films became smoother and non-porous while X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed crystalline nature of films improved. The resulted films also demonstrated higher tensile strength and elongation at break (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, addition of rice flour did not significantly influence (p > 0.05) the Young’s Modulus measurement. Overall, chicken skin gelatin films with rice flour at 20%, (w/w) demonstrated better characteristics than other films.",

Microstructural analysis revealed immiscibility in the two polymers, due to the presence of distinct melting points, heterogeneous phase and vibrational frequencies unique to each polymer. Thermal and tensile testing also suggests that the inclusion of ABM tailored the blend and significantly improved its thermal stability and flexibility, since 0.5 and 1.0% (wt./wt.) ABM led to 490 and 432% improvement in elongation, respectively. Furthermore, the ternary blend films in contact with Salmonella enteritidis (S. enteritidis) showed significant inhibition to growth for 24 h, but some bacterial cells grew when the film were removed. This study demonstrates the fabrication of ABM tuned potential biopolymer packaging flexible blend with bacteriostatic properties.",

Nanoclay addition had significant effect on tensile strength, elongation at break, water sorption and solubility of the film. Glass transition temperature of OP film was 44 °C. Moisture sorption isotherm was found to be of type-II with a typical sigmoid shape. FTIR spectra revealed that formaldehyde and nanoclay caused minor changes and the film was completely biodegradable within 114 h. Overall migration into n-heptane was found to be lowest among all food simulants.

It was found that the incorporation of CEO increased the thickness, water vapour permeability, oxygen permeability, and elongation at break of the films and significantly reduced the moisture content and tensile strength. However, water vapour permeability was reduced when 15 g/L CEO was incorporated into the films. The oxygen permeability of films slightly decreased with increasing Tween® 80 concentration. Moreover, SA/CMC films containing CEO exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. With increasing CEO amount to 15 g/L, the inhibitory effects on Staphylococcus aureus increased with increasing amounts of Tween® 80.

     "abstract": "Herba Menthae Haplocalycis(HMH) is a traditional Chinese health food that is commonly used in the food industry, as well as numerous other industries. As the demand for HMH is increasing dramatically, a greater number of people are paying close attention to the quality of HMH. In this paper, we describe the establishment of an effective ultra high performance liquid chromatography – photo diode array (UPLC-PDA) method to study the effect of different storage environments (low temperature and humidity, normal temperature and humidity, high temperature and humidity) and packaging materials (ziplock bags, braided bags, kraft paper) on the HMH quality. The results from this study demonstrated that storage environments and packaging materials both influence the quality of HMH. The contents of hesperidin, diosimin, diosmetin-7-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, didymin and buddleoside were significantly affected when stored under conditions with normal temperature and humidity (P < 0.05), high temperature and humidity (P < 0.05), braided bags (P < 0.05) and kraft paper (P < 0.05). In addition, mycotoxins (aflatoxin B1, aflatoxin B2 and ochratoxin) were found in the food, which was also found to affect the quality. However, the contents of caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, and diosimin were determined to be unaffected by the low temperature and humidity (P > 0.05) and ziplock bag storage (P > 0.05). Furthermore, we found that the contents of the eight components were decreased less at low temperature and humidity and in ziplock bags, compared to other storage environments and packaging materials. In addition, no mycotoxins were detected. These results indicate that low temperature and humidity and ziplock bag storage conditions are beneficial for maintaining HMH quality. This present study may provide a scientific basis for the quality control and establishment of novel storage specifications for HMH.",

Despite the more advanced ripening stage and the increase of polyphenol oxidase activity and ethylene production, nectarine fruit stored for 10 days were successfully processed to get fresh-cuts still marketable until 7 d after being cutting. Indeed, no difference occurred between fruit stored for 1 d before cutting and those stored for 10 d, in terms of firmness, weight loss and marketability of fresh-cut slices. The carotenoid content went descending dramatically in all samples of ‘Big Bang’ slices while in-package CO2 partial pressures were highest at 5, 7, 12 d of storage in fresh-cut to more from fruit stored for 1 d.",

LDA of spectral data was applied to sustain SA data.For fallow deer the room mean square error of prediction values for external samples were 0.75, 0.61, 0.81 and 0.73 log cfu g−1, for TVC, psychrotrophs, LAB, and Enterobacteriaceae, respectively. For goat, the corresponding values were 0.74, 0.68, 0.78 and 0.79 log cfu g−1.FTIR spectroscopy can be used as a reliable method for assessment of freshness of meat from fallow deer and goat during storage.",

Chitosan, in replacement of the most commonly used wet strength resin (PAAE), increased polyphenols retention more than 10 times. Paper sheets produced with the highest molecular weight chitosan, at pH 7 and with MFC addition showed the best wet strength (7.4 ± 0.5 Nm/g) and wet resistance (13.3 ± 1.2%).

In this study, release of silver from nanosilver-polyethylene composite films into 3% acetic acid under different migration test methods were investigated, with the aim to understand the effect of exposure condition on silver release. The following test protocols were designed for the experiment: single-sided contact versus two-sided contact, more versus fewer cut edges, and glass migration cell versus metal one. The results show that samples under two-sided contact had higher silver release than that under one-sided contact. Besides, increasing the number of cut edges largely increased the release of silver, while using metal instead of glass migration cell significantly reduced the release. Furthermore, partially floated films have lower silver release than that of totally immersed films. As a conclusion, impact of migration test method on the release of nanocomponent is different from that on the migration of common migrants and therefore, exposure condition should be carefully taken into account in the design of migration test for nanosilver-polyethylene composite films to minimize any potential negative impact on obtaining comparable results.",

The influence of a chitosan coating deposited on the cap surface was also investigated. Temperature was the most important factor in preserving the quality attributes of mushrooms over time. The test material had a positive impact on weight loss, cap opening percentage, and firmness of mushrooms compared with the control film (∼1.0% versus ∼7.1%; ∼55% versus ∼65%; and ∼10.3 N versus ∼7.6 N, respectively), which was ascribed to the excellent and good oxygen and water vapor barrier properties of the new material, respectively. Mushrooms packaged under the modified atmosphere behaved decidedly better after a prolonged storage time of 22 days at 4 °C. Impressively, after this extended temporal window, the mushrooms looked freshly packed by fully recovering their original color. We explained this striking observation in consideration of the oxygen that permeated the package during these additional 12 days of storage, which would have promoted a gradual resumption of respiratory activity in the overall metabolism of the mushrooms after the “freezing” effect of the rich-CO2 atmosphere inside the package.",

PEG-iso linkers were chemically grafted into HAGS forming three dimensional urethane (PEG-PU) networks. The HAGS-PEG-PU films were prepared by using 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20% (w/w) of PEG-iso linkers on solid basis. The tensile strength, elongation and hydrophobicity (measured as contact angle) of HAGS-PEG-PU films were significantly affected by the chain lengths of the PEG-iso linkers and their concentration in the film. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding between HAGS and PEG-iso linkers increased with the increase of PEG-iso content in the films. At a fixed MW of PEG-iso linker, an increase of its concentration up to 20% (w/w) improved the compatibility and formation of interpenetrating networks between HAGS and PEG-PU. The highest flexibility (1166% elongation at break) in HAGS-PEG-PU films was obtained when PEG-iso linker synthesized with PEG 1000 Da was used. The ultimate tensile strength of the films increased when PEG-iso linkers with higher chain lengths were used. The hydrophobicity of the films was found to depend on the hydrogen bond density, degree of chain entanglement and crystalline structure and compatibility between HAGS and PEG-PU in the film matrix.",

Moreover, oligomers were able to diffuse from the matrix, regardless the aqueous medium acidity. Experimental data of diffusion assays were fitted using a mathematical model, estimating diffusion coefficients at three studied pH values (3, 5, and 7). Active film was used to obtain sachets to package perishable foods such as strawberries, ricotta, and flavored breads, which were stored for 7 days under controlled conditions. Antimicrobial capacity of active sachets was corroborated through molds and yeast counts in the stored food products.

     "abstract": "Fresh fruit and vegetables are a major source of biologically active compounds essential for human wellbeing. They are, however, perishable living products that require coordinated actions by growers, storage operators, processors, and retailers to maintain their quality and reduce food loss and waste. Recent advances in shelf life extension have been achieved by the combination of treatments including suitable temperature, humidity, and gas composition that maintain their quality and safety. Fresh produce attributes such as appearance, texture, flavour and nutritional value have been traditional quality criteria, but increasingly safety and traceability are important for all the role players along the supply chain from the farm to consumer. Non-destructive techniques for analysing the quality of fresh produce are valuable tools applicable along the supply chain. Advances in optical methods were touched in this perspective article pointing to new methods to inform the user. Quality deterioration and microbial contamination leading to spoilage and postharvest losses can occur at any of the supply chain stages. Therefore, postharvest treatments are essential to minimise quality loss, microbial spoilage and reduce the risk of pathogen contamination. Various postharvest physical, chemical and gaseous treatments can be applied to maintain fresh-like quality without compromising the sensory and nutritional aspects. The consequences of these techniques on quality and safety of fresh horticultural commodities are highlighted in this paper. Future research should aim at improving organoleptic quality and meeting safety standards of fresh produce at all steps of the supply chain.",

Therefore, this study was undertaken to optimize the gas composition for cold storage (10 °C) of pomegranate arils (cv. Wonderful) based on microbiological criteria. Selecting experimental points and optimizing gas concentration were carried out according to the simplex lattice mixture design with three factors (O2, CO2 and N2). Seven gas combinations including low O2 (2–18 kPa), enriched and high CO2 (2–18 kPa) and 80–96 kPa N2 were used in varying concentrations and the bacterial, yeast and mould growth on arils were analysed. Aerobic mesophilic bacteria growth varies between 3.95–5.89 log CFU g−1 and yeast growth was between 3.84–5.91 log CFU g−1, whereas, mould growth was between 2.15–3.63 log CFU g−1 across the modified atmospheres. Data from these analyses were used to fit linear and cubical polynomial models. Pareto analysis and ternary contour plots showed that the main effects (CO2, N2 and O2) as well as their interaction had significant effects on microbial growth. For all microbial criteria’s, the lowest growth was tend to move to the highest CO2 in the modified atmosphere system. On the contrary, the presence of higher O2 concentration stimulated the growth. This was evident that, the gas mixture containing 12.67–18 kPa CO2, 2–4.67 kPa O2 and 80 − 82.67 kPa N2 significantly reduced microbial count on pomegranate arils. Validation of the model showed that the cubical model predicted the microbial counts effectively with high correlation coefficients of R2 > 94% for mould and >99% for aerobic mesophilic bacteria and yeast, whereas, the linear model overestimated bacteria and yeast counts and underestimated mould count.",

Thus, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has long term experience in the evaluation of consequences of the consumption of minimal processed RTE products. This authority publicized a list of the ten riskiest foods with leafy greens on the top.Sanitation steps based on plasma processes could be an promising addition to conventional cleaning procedures. Plasma, often introduced as forth state of matter, differs from the gaseous state of matter by a certain amount of free charge carriers caused by ionization processes of the gas atoms and molecules due to the supply of energy. The electrical conductivity allows supplying the energy needed to sustain this state electrically, giving access to a huge variety of plasma generation methods with excitation frequencies from DC to several GHz offering wide parameter ranges e.g. electron energies from 0.5 eV to 10 eV.The treatment of natural products with changing parameters like size, shape or water content is a challenging task for design and optimization of plasma processes. The lack of effectiveness of sanitation processes on the surfaces of food products is a general problem of all discussed methods.In order to overcome these problems a specific plasma process was established, based on a microwave plasma torch operated with compressed air delivering plasma processed air (PPA) as antimicrobial acting process gas. If PPA is brought into contact with water, plasma processed water (PPW) is generated which has antimicrobial properties. This PPW process was implemented into a pilot-plant scale salad-rinsing unit in order to demonstrate the scalability and applicability of this treatment procedure. During the trial 45 kg Endive (Cichorium endivia) and about 1.500 l of plasma generated disinfectant were consumed.

Rocket leaves were kept in macroperforated bags in order to prevent modification of atmosphere within the headspace (as control). The packed rockets at 0 °C retained ascorbic acid content while it decreased during storage at higher temperatures.

The off-odors from dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl disulfides (DMDS) and other volatiles were produced at 5° and 15 °C, changing the initial headspace fingerprint, which was best preserved at 0 °C. Results of this work showed that improper packaging condition may decrease the shelf-life of rocket leaves compared to storage in air, inducing loss of appearance score, the production of off-odors and the degradation of Vitamin C.

Further on, the effectiveness of ethylene removal using conventional ethylene absorbent sachets as well as an in-house developed ultraviolet light based reactor in such mixed storage was also evaluated. High ethylene producer (apples) was stored along with non-treated green bananas and unripe kiwifruit (highly sensitive to ethylene), at 15 °C for 10 days. Post-storage analysis showed that bananas and kiwifruits stored with apples had significantly elevated respiration and ethylene production rates compared to samples stored alone. Mix loading with apples resulted in a significant decline in tissue strength from 25.01 to 6.44 N for kiwifruits; and a significant increase in total soluble sugars from 2.7 to 21.09% for bananas at the end of storage. The use of ethylene absorbent as well as the reactor reduced ethylene concentration in the storage chamber and slowed down respiration rate in the fruits. However, to preserve fruit quality to a higher extent, further research into development of ethylene removal system with higher ethylene removal rate is suggested. The results obtained also highlight the need of proper separation of fresh produce (based on ethylene sensitivity) during transportation, storage and retail display.",

     "abstract": "Equilibrium modified atmosphere packaging (EMAP) technology offers the possibility to maintain produce postharvest quality and extend its shelf-life. However, EMAP stability depends on well-tuned packaging design parameters to match environment conditions. This study defined design requirements of a biobased film EMAP that can preserve quality and prolong shelf-life of fresh cherry tomatoes under recommended and simulated abuse supply chain conditions. Optimum EMAP was evaluated based on headspace gas composition at 10–20 °C, 75–95% RH and verified by determining quality changes of packed cherry tomatoes in using a continuous or micro-perforated (0.27 μm) bio-based intact bitter cassava (IBC) film. This was compared with a non-bio-based polymer film (oriented polypropylene, OPP). The IBC film attained equilibrium O2 (2–3%) after 180 h at 10 °C, with 0 and 1 perforation, for 75 and 95% RH while OPP film maintained a downward O2 fall. Continuous and micro-perforated IBC film did not show any major differences in equilibrium headspace O2, thus perforation can be neglected. Based on desirability optimisation results, biobased IBC film demonstrated better optimized EMAP system in attaining recommended gas and stretching cherry tomato shelf-life as compared to non-biobased (OPP) film. The application of bio-based IBC film offers new possibilities in packaging fresh produce under equilibrium modified atmosphere without compromising their quality.",

Addition of fish gelatin to sago starch films significantly reduced tensile strength (TS), water vapor permeability (WVP) but increased the percentage of elongation at break (%EAB). Positive effects of TGs addition on mechanical properties were observed. FTIR-ATR showed an evident of interaction between polysaccharides and protein.

Especially prior to any preparation the sensory impression is the deciding factor for further processing or any form of consumption. The focus of this study was the sensory evaluation and microbiological characterization by MALDI-TOF of raw chicken meat packaged in two different atmospheres (“CO2(30)”: 30/70% CO2/O2 and “CO2(15)”: 15/85% CO2/O2) over a period of 14 days for CO2(30) and 8 days for CO2(15). The results showed that the composition of the modified atmospheres affects the sensory perception. The chicken meat packaged in CO2(30) was characterized by a sensorial longer shelf life, than the one stored in CO2(15). This could be attributed to the limited inhibition of Pseudomonas sp. in CO2(15). In addition, only a few attributes lead to the waste of meat, while other attributes were found to influence sensory perception only when a critical value of 107 CFU (colony forming units) cm−2 had already been surpassed. The two attributes general visual impression and general orthonasal impression were suggested as the most suitable indicators of spoilage. By utilisation of sequential logistic regression the meat quality was subdivided in different levels of decay including “fresh”, “no longer fresh” and “spoiled”, in correlation with the sensory evaluation.",

Blend film showed improved mechanical properties respect to CH films. The sample with a SC/CH ratio equal to 2 and surface density of 10 mg cm−2 has the greatest elastic modulus, tensile strength and elongation at break values.

First, a gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS) method was developed to detect the total content of the two ultraviolet absorbents 2-hydroxy-4-n-octyloxybenzophenone (UV-531) and 2-(2′-hydroxy-5′-methylphenyl) (UV-P) in graphene-LDPE composite films. Toluene soluble extraction was selected to process the samples with different additives for its better extract effect.

The limits of detection of UV-531, UV-P were 0.3 ng/mL and 0.5 ng/mL, respectively. The migration test reveals that the two ultraviolet absorbers had no interaction with each other on their migration into isooctane, but graphene hindered the migration of the two ultraviolet absorbers. The reason might be that the incorporated graphene reduce the number and/or the size of free volume within the polymer by occupying some of the free volume, which may affect the diffusion of the two ultraviolet absorbers; in addition, they are absorbed by the nearby graphene within the polymer.",

Savory and thyme oils also considerably decreased (54–67%) lesion expansion. The results of a fruit firmness assay showed that savory and thyme oils applied at 500–2000 μl L−1 resulted in fruit that were 2.5-3.3 times firmer than the non-treated controls, whereas other oils applied at 500 μl L−1 did not help maintain fruit firmness.

     "abstract": "Regarding the reduction of synthetic food packaging materials’ pollution, the purpose of the present study is to examine a new biopolymer-based film to be employed in food packaging. Diverse ratios (1:4, 2:3, 3:2, and 4:1 w/w) of ZnO nanorod (ZnO-nr) and nano-kaolin combinations were incorporated into semolina film matrices, and nanocomposite films were formed using the solvent casting method. We examined the resultant films in terms of their barrier, optical, heat sealability, and structural attributes. Whilst increasing the level of ZnO-nr resulted in the decline of the oxygen permeability (OP) of the films, the increase in the percentage of nano-kaolin led to the improvement in the heat sealability of such films. Moreover, the intensification of the nanoparticle loading triggered a decline in the moisture content and water solubility of the nanocomposite films at all different nanofiller ratios. The increase of the ZnO-nr content also significantly affected the light absorbance level of the semolina films. Remarkable differences in the surface morphology were observed between the control and bio-nanocomposite films as revealed by the FESEM images. The semolina-based bioactive films exhibited distinctive antimicrobial activity against gram-negative food pathogens, namely Escherichia coli. Succinctly, regarding food packaging purposes, the findings of this study advocate the direct incorporation of ZnO-nr and nano-kaolin into semolina matrices to produce active biodegradable films.",

It was packed in retort pouches and processed in a retort at 121 °C from F0 7 to 11 min. All the samples were stored at ambient temperature and analyzed for various quality characteristics for 12 months. During storage, all the processed samples showed a decreasing trend for pH, shear force and sensory attributes while showed an increasing trend for free fatty acid content and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. All the processed samples were microbiologically safe with acceptable sensory characteristics throughout the storage. However, the samples processed to F0 9 showed the highest overall acceptability. The present study suggests that retort pouch processing is suitable for long term storage of Rogan josh at ambient temperature with acceptable quality and safety for 12 months. Retort pouch processing of Rogan josh will thus, help to increase the market demand for such traditional products due to convenience and ready to eat features.",

The objective of this study was to explore the effect of storage conditions on the retention of physicochemical properties of guava powder. The spray-dried guava powder was packed by LDPE, PET laminated and OPP laminated film and stored at 5 °C and 25 °C for 10 weeks. The shelf life prediction was measured from the linear regression kinetic equation of water activity. Packaging film, storage temperature and time had significant effect on powder properties. PET laminated film showed the most significant effect in retention of moisture, water activity and lycopene. LDPE packed powder was the least effective in moisture control, which led to increase of glass transition temperature (Tg) and degree of caking (CD) and loss of color and lycopene. Higher storage temperature (25 °C) considerably increased the moisture gain, water activity, Tg and CD. The suitable storage condition for guava powder was PET laminated film at 5 °C that showed the maximum predicted shelf life (34.95 weeks) with the highest lycopene retention (74.56%) and low moisture content of <3%.",

This film showed excellent biocidal effect, high elongation value (600%) and little loss of keratin after immersion in water. The capability of citric acid to bind keratin macromolecules by hydrogen bonds is probably responsible for the improvement of film's extensibility. On the other hand, the study of FT-IR spectrum allows understanding that the presence of citric acid in aqueous solution enhances the content of alpha helix structure in the film, with a reduction in the amount of side chain and disordered conformations in the macromolecular structure. Carrot shelf-life was qualitatively improved with this film in comparison with a commercial film for preserving food. Consequently, this film can have possible application for food packaging as a substitute of synthetic polymers replacing them with a natural, environmental friendly and renewable resource.",

     "abstract": "Changes in the structure of lactose constitute the main physical modification of dairy powders and may lead to other changes during product storage. Raman spectroscopy was confirmed to be a viable analytical tool to aid in identifying the lactose state of whey protein concentrate (WPC) during production and storage. The dehydrated products obtained in this study had mean aw values greater than 0.200, indicating that changes in characteristics may occur rapidly during storage. The effects of different treatments and storage conditions on the crystallization of lactose were identified by spectral changes near 2900 cm−1 and between 1200 and 800 cm−1, attributed to the phase change of amorphous lactose into crystalline lactose. For samples stored at ambient temperature and humidity, changes in the Raman spectra occurred after three weeks of storage. For samples stored in desiccators, changes were not observed until one year of storage. As such, the presence of oxygen and moisture in the environment can increase the rate of modifications of WPC. The association between Raman spectroscopy and chemometrics may be considered a screening method for routine analysis or production line control. The results of this article provide an important tool for the dairy industries and for research in dairy concentrated and dried dairy products, enabling the development of sensors for dairy spray dryers to improve the control and the standardization of products and technology.",

The objectives of this study were to optimize the packaging system and to investigate the effects of water rinsing prior to packaging of rucola on changes in quality and accumulation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Washed and unwashed rucola were packed using different packaging systems: without perforations (MAP-0); optimized 2 micro-perforations of 0.5 mm diameter (MAP-2); and 21 macro-perforations with 5 mm diameter (Control). Gas composition in control packages stayed close to air, while MAP-0 led to anoxia, and for MAP-2 equilibrium modified atmosphere was achieved by day 2 of storage within the range of 2–3% O2 and 10–12% CO2. Browning of cut edges, water loss, and loss of turgor pressure was most severe for samples in the control packages. Degradation of rucola quality attributes was delayed under MAP-2. A total of 33 VOCs were tentatively identified via GC–MS, consisting of 18 primary (detected on fresh samples prior to storage) and 15 secondary (detected on samples during storage) VOCs. Accumulation of secondary VOCs and development of strong off-odour was higher for washed samples in comparison to unwashed samples. MAP-0 led to development fermentative off-odour by day 3 of storage. Perceived development off-odour based on sensory evaluation was observed to be consistent with the accumulation of ethyl esters, benzaldehyde and benzeneacetaldehyde volatiles.

     "abstract": "In the present work, a strategy for the synthesis of novel polyacrylates covalently linked to natural antioxidants was accomplished in a two-step process. First, monomers were prepared via lipase-catalyzed transesterification of acrylic acid methyl ester with tyrosol (T) or hydroxytyrosol (HT). Then, tyrosyl acrylate (TA) and hydroxytyrosyl acrylate (HTA) were subjected to radical homopolymerization to give poly(tyrosyl)acrylate (PTA) and poly(hydroxytyrosyl)acrylate (PHTA), respectively. The monomers and the corresponding homopolymers were characterized with FT-IR and NMR techniques and by Folin-Ciocalteu method to give an estimation of the available phenolic groups, as T and HT equivalents, linked to the polymers. The results of DPPH radical scavenging assay indicate that the free radical scavenging activity of tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol was almost completely retained in the corresponding monomers and polymers. In addition, polyacrylate films did not exhibit any cytotoxic activities in vitro on RAT1 normal fibroblast cells, using MTT assay.",

     "abstract": "Poor transport conditions can result in an accelerated decay in beer quality. Optimal beer packaging should minimize the impact of temperature changes and vibrations, which occur during (long-haul) transport. In this research, the performance of different beer packagings (BP) regarding vibration damping and thermal insulation was investigated. Three BP’s were tested (A: 24 × 33cl cardboard crate/B: 6 × 25cl cardboard crate + plastic foil/C: 24 × 25cl plastic crate).Cardboard in combination with plastic foil (BP- B) appears to be the best packaging strategy due to the positive thermal insulation properties of cardboard. The plastic foil ties the beer bottles together leaving little space for the bottles to move and therefor reduces the air transfer contributing to better thermal insulation properties. Finally, cardboard in combination with plastic foil exhibits damping characteristics. With a holistic BP strategy, one can control vibrations and temperature biases, which is beneficial for the quality of beer.",

Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) is well-proven postharvest technology for preserving natural quality of fresh and minimally processed produce, and extending the storage life under optimum MAP design and storage conditions. Successful MAP design is achieved by the mathematical integration of dynamic produce physiological characteristics, properties of packaging material, coupled with optimum equilibrium atmospheric conditions for the given product. This review examines the various mathematical approaches to the design of modified atmosphere system for handling and storage of fruit and vegetables, including the interaction between fresh produce physiological process, packaging and environmental conditions, which in turn influence produce shelf life and quality. Different mathematical modelling approaches are presented, factors affecting modelling performance are discussed and examples of model applications are highlighted to demonstrate relevance to specific types of produce. Future prospects for modelling MAP are highlighted, including the importance of an integrated modelling approach for improved understanding of package performance for fresh and minimally processed produce under MAP.",

Antimicrobial activity against two bacteria, Listeria innocua and Escherichia coli, and two fungi, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium expansum, was studied. Silver-loaded starch-PVA films exhibited antimicrobial activity against the tested microorganisms, which depended heavily on the concentration of AgNPs. Their addition only led to notable physical changes in the colour and transparency of the films, which underwent significant changes and turned brownish-yellow and opaque, this being more notable when the silver concentration rose. Silver was released into aqueous simulants in its entirety within the first 60 min of contact. In the non-polar simulant (oleic acid), the release capacity of the films drastically decreased, being the only case where the established limit (60 mg/kg simulant) was met. As a consequence, the use of the developed films as food packaging materials should be restricted to fat-rich foodstuffs.",

Results revealed that the Acacia lignin has good potential to be blended into alginate film to synthesize active antimicrobial, antioxidant biodegradable film.

Lignin extracted from Acacia wood by alkali method was used for the preparation of LA blended films using solution casting method with varying ratio of lignin. The physico-chemical properties, in-vitro cytotoxicity, antimicrobial activity and drug release behavior of the film were investigated. Alginate films incorporated with lignin had significantly lower water solubility (up to 26%) and tensile strength (TS, 0.146 MPa). Infrared spectroscopy suggested that lignin interacts with alginate by hydrogen bonding. Mechanical and thermal properties of films vary as a function of lignin content, showing optimum values for films modified with 20% (w/v) lignin. The LA blended film had improved light barrier and antimicrobial properties with low cytotoxicity, which is useful in food applications for preventing ultraviolet-induced lipid oxidation. Hence, the use of LA film could be a useful for maintaining the quality and shelf life of food and non-food product.",

The addition of natamycin reduced solubility values and water permeability, increases L*, b* and ΔE, whereas it did not significantly affect the moisture content of the films or puncture force. The analysis of the microstructure indicated that natamycin was incorporated homogenously onto the films. The diffusional exponents were between 0.5 and 1 (non-fickian diffusion). The antifungal activity of the active triticale flour films against Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger were demonstrated by agar diffusion test. In the case of C. albicans the zone of inhibition was greater at higher concentrations, while against A. niger there were no significant differences. In addition, we studied the performance of active films through testing soft cheese, covered partly with control and activated films and stored 14 days at 4 °C and at room temperature. Visual inspection showed growth of mold on cheese surfaces that were not covered and on the coated with film control, while those covered with activated films did not show mold growth. In conclusion, the addition of natamycin to triticale flour films allows obtaining a material suitable for use in food packaging as active container of cheese to inhibit deterioration.",

Therefore, integration of OOR into CH can be used to improve the inhibition properties of CH based film against spoilage and pathogenic strains. The olive leaves extract exhibited valuable efficiency than olive pomace extract in both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the result suggested that CH-OOR could be explored as a novel and potential natural edible coating to substitute the synthetic agents for apple and strawberry coating.",

At 0, 5, 10 and 15 d, samples were taken to perform analysis of colour, firmness, soluble solids content (SSC), weight loss, microbial growth, phenolic compounds (total phenolics, flavonoids, anthocyanins), sugars, organic acids, antioxidant activity (TEAC and ORAC), acetaldehyde, CO2 production and sensory evaluation. Cytotoxicity of the edible coatings was also evaluated on THP-1 and Caco-2 cells. Results of this experiment showed that the edible coatings were not cytotoxic and generally did not significantly affect nutritional quality parameters. They were efficient in controlling microbial food spoilage. Acceptance by consumers of the coated raspberries was good up to 14 d, while control fruit were acceptable only till 7 d. The edible coating that best preserved quality was PE 1% + Cit 0.15% + Eug 0.1%.",

Previous work has reported successful extension of strawberry shelf life through the use of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas treatments. In this study, California strawberries purchased at retail stores were treated with continuously generated ClO2 gas over concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 5.0 mg/L for durations ranging from 7 to 1000 min to determine how ClO2 gas impacts fungal mortality and fruit quality as a function of treatment concentration, treatment duration, and ClO2 absorption by the fruit. Repeated measures and Gompertz models were used to infer on the efficacy of the ClO2 gas, and a novel method was used to quantify the ClO2 absorption by fresh produce. It was found that ClO2 gas treatments have minimal effect at delaying the onset or growth rate of Botrytis cinerea for treatments followed by incubation at 4 or 22 °C even when corrected for natural variability of Botrytis cinerea presence among batches of strawberries, indicating that treatments are not sufficient for shelf-life extension.",

The CAc-based active films presented high antifungal activity against the tested phytopathogens, mainly in vapor phase. MMT30B exhibit good dispersion in CAc matrix, resulting in a partially exfoliated conformation. In this way, MMT30B significantly increased films’ rigidity and thermal resistance while reduced OTR. OEO acted as plasticizer, facilitating MMT30B dispersion. Also, OEO increased extensibility and decreased WVTR of CAc-based films.

By stressing the packages through laboratory simulated transportation hazards, it created failures to the packages that would not have normally shown up during a traditional test protocol, such as accelerated shelf life testing (ASLT). Results showed packages evaluated through a simulated transport test reported an average oxygen transmission rate three times greater than samples having not been transport tested. Outcomes from this study showed the rate at which some properties of the food and package can increase as a result of the simulated transportation, versus standard ASLT with only increased temperature and humidity.

In anaerobic packaging, a mixture of succinate and glutamate formed deoxymyoglobin rapidly and it remained in this state for 13 days. In aerobic packaging (75% O2), the highest oxymyoglobin level occurred with a molar ratio of (glutamate–malate) to citrate of 3:1. In this case, oxymyoglobin was more prevalent after 6–8 days of storage in aerobic condition than without addition of these compounds. Pyruvate induced metmyoglobin formation, acting as a pro-oxidant.Succinate presumed leading to FADH2; was most effective at converting metmyoglobin to deoxymyoglobin in anaerobic packaging. In aerobic packaging, NADH presumed formed by the oxidation of glutamate may maintain oxymyoglobin levels, but adding citrate as well is recommended.

An improvement in the barrier properties against O2 and CO2 was observed for all the tested nanocomposite coatings. The best performance was provided by the particles with the highest surface area (750 m2 g−1) (O2TR ∼30 mL m−2 24 h−1 and CO2TR ∼80 mL m−2 24 h−1 at 23 °C under dry conditions) compared to the pristine pullulan-coated BOPP (O2TR ∼480 mL m−2 24 h−1 and CO2TR ∼1245 mL m−2 24 h−1). Noteworthy, the change in the permeability properties ultimately yielded a decrease of the CO2/O2 selectivity towards 1. The addition of CS nanoparticles did not modify the optical attributes of the pullulan coating, with the final haze values being approximately 1.5% for all nanocomposite layers. The wettability of the final coatings was influenced by the addition of the CS nanoparticles, with a remarkable decrease of the water contact angle to ∼19° for the formulation loaded with the lowest concentration of silica nanoparticles that have the smallest size and the highest surface area.

     "abstract": "Assessing gas permeation of the whole food packaging in industrial conditions (RH, temperature including stretching and sealing effect) is fundamental for predicting the quality changes of packed food during processing and shelf life. Permeability coefficients are usually assessed on a small flat, piece of packaging material which is not representative of the whole pack (usually assembly of tray + lid film or pouches of flexible films sealed on at least 2 or 3 sides) used in the industry. Moreover, conditions used are standardised (temperature of 23 °C, 0%RH) which are not representative of conditions that prevail in real use. This simplified approach may lead to erroneous mass transfer predictions when simplified permeability values are used in calculation. To face this problem, we propose a simple methodology for the assessment of the gas permeability coefficients (N2, CO2, O2) in sealed intact large scale (industrial) packaging (whole packaging) in conditions of temp and RH mimicking the real conditions of use (encountered by the material in contact with the food product). The CO2 permeability assessed in the industrial-like conditions was significantly higher compared to the one assessed with standard method. The higher gas permeation measured was ascribed to the impact of industrial operations such as shrinking and hot sealing. Our results highlight the necessity to better characterize impacts of industrial conditions such as hot sealing and shrinking on the permeability of the whole pack when prediction of gas permeation through packaging during food processing is needed.",

     "abstract": "Montmorillonite (MMT) nanoclay and microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) were incorporated into Fish myofibrillar protein (FMP) film to improve its functional properties. The MMT and MTGase weight percent relative to protein was varied from 1 to 5 and 1 to 3, respectively, and their impact on physical, mechanical, and barrier properties of the FMP films was investigated. Microstructure of FMP nanocomposites was characterized through; scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that incorporating MMT and MTGase into film improves significantly water gain, water vapor permeability, and solubility of the FMP film. It was also shown that the combined effect of clay and MTGase improves significantly the tensile strength and elongation of nanocomposites (p < 0.05). The SEM, XRD and FTIR results confirmed that the improvements are related to the MMT exfoliation and good interaction between fish myofibrillar protein and MTGase in the presence of MMT.",

     "abstract": "Transforming waste cassava into a sustainable resource requires a new approach and redesign of the current processing methodologies. Bitter cassava cultivars have been employed mainly as an emergency famine food, but could also be used as a value added material for packaging. Processing of intact bitter cassava can minimize waste, and produce low-cost added value biopolymer packaging films for targeted applications. This study developed an improved simultaneous release, recovery and cyanogenesis (SRRC) downstream processing methodology for sustainable reduction of waste and development of film packaging material using intact bitter cassava.SRRC approach produced peeled (BP) and intact (BI) bitter cassava biopolymer derivatives. BI showed significantly higher yields ensuring 16% waste decrease with no environmental impact caused by discard residues. SRRC was very effective in reducing the total cyanogen content to within Codex minimum safety limits, demonstrating that the peeling of bitter cassava process can be avoided. Transparent films were produced using the casting method from both BP and BI derivatives. BI films were more transparent and homogeneous, less soluble, less permeable to moisture, less hydrophilic, more permeable to oxygen and carbon-dioxide, sealable, lower cost, than the BP.Hence, intact bitter cassava and SRRC can be used as sustainable, safe, integrative process solution for high value-added product (e.g., packaging film) production from low-cost biobased materials.",

Lipid oxidation was studied at the surface and the inner part by measuring secondary lipid oxidation products (TBARs) and the tendency to form radicals by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Lipid oxidation was lower in the inner part than at the surface for all three packaging systems. Rosemary active packaging was the most effective method to protect pork patties from the HPP-induced lipid oxidation, while oxygen scavenger packaging was not effective since residual oxygen remained in the package in the initial period of storage. The kinetics of the oxygen trapping by oxygen scavengers appears to be a crucial factor for this application.",

     "abstract": "Shelf-life of many foods is largely dependent on the barrier to moisture and oxygen of the respective package. Barrier is often assessed by measuring the transmission rate of films. However, in thermosealed packages leaks and weak seals can give rise to increased total mass transfer entering the system and reaching the food. While leaks are random defects and are associated to early failure, lower integrity of regular seals tends to affect whole batch causing a decrease in the product shelf-life. In the present work the contribution of the seals to total permeability of packages was assessed by measuring transmission rate of the film and of thermosealed packages of different sizes, therefore with different seals length. Packages made of PA/PE and PVDC coated PET/PE and their respective films were tested for moisture and oxygen transmission rate at different temperature and relative humidity. Results indicate that industrial regular produced seals can account for ca. 25% of the total mass transfer through the system. This decrease of the package barrier as compared to the material barrier will have a significant impact on the product shelf-life and it should be considered in the packaging design process.",

The effect on permeability of the driving force (aw difference) and the aw values at each side of the film, were analysed.

The evaluation of such approach was subject of this study.Film samples coated with Shellac (Shel) and cellulose nitrate (NC), containing olive leaf extract (OLE) and grape pomace extract (GPE) at different concentrations were put in contact with three food simulants, namely W (water), A (10% ethanol) and D1 (50% ethanol), and the antioxidant capacity was assessed by suitably modified ABTS test.The equilibrium antioxidant capacity increased from W to A and D1 for GPE and OLE: the antioxidant levels attained films containing GPE were 0.272, 0.483 and 0.728 Trolox mEq/L at 5% concentration, and 0.705, 0.786 and 0.893 Trolox mEq/L at 10% concentration for W, A and D1 simulants, respectively.

Active linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) composites were manufactured by immobilization of resveratrol in the polymeric matrix and also by pre-incorporation of the resveratrol into a food contact permitted montmorillonite clay prior to melt mixing with the polymer. Migration tests from active films in water and isooctane showed extremely low migration levels in water (below 0.01 mg/kg) and was not detectable in isooctane. The resulting composites not only showed strong antioxidant activity, but also antimicrobial activity.

The efficacy of PL treatment can be affected by several factors, including the low penetration ability of PL, the shadowing effect of microorganisms, and the composition and properties of the surfaces. The mechanism of microbial inactivation by PL are also summarized. To increase the efficacy of sterilization, PL treatment in combination with chemicals or other decontamination techniques and their applications are also discussed.

Nevertheless, a small miscibility of PCL in the starch phase was detected trough the shift in the glass transition temperature of the starch phase, which leads to a partial inhibition of amylose crystallization during film formation and storage. The lack of interfacial adhesion of PCL and starch phases promoted films’ fragility and reduced stretchability, although elastic modulus of the films with small PCL ratios increased.

They are processed according to empirical/traditional procedures and are characterized by a natural green colour, a rich aroma and a typical bitter taste. In the present conditions of processing, the olives after packing are not stable having a rather short shelf life mainly due to the leakage of brines and swelling of the containers which contributes to enormous economic losses. The aim of this work was to increase the shelf life of packed olives, studying the effect of acidifying agents (lactic, citric and hydrochloric acids) and preservatives (benzoic and sorbic acids) on the microbiological aspects, physicochemical parameters (pH, acidity, reducing sugars and colour) and overall eating/tasting quality of olives after 158 days.The additives tested prevented the growing of yeasts and Enterobacteriaceae and production of gas during the storage resulting in an increase in the shelf life of olives. The lowest sensory evaluation was attributed to olives preserved with benzoic, sorbic and lactic acids and the highest sensory scores were obtained by olives packed in brines containing the mixture of citric and lactic acid and acidified with hydrochloric acid. The acidification of the brines with the mixture of citric and lactic acids resulted in an acceptable strategy to pack cracked olives. The results obtained could help local industries introduce changes in the existing methods of packing of this Mediterranean food to increase shelf life and prevent economic losses.",

Changes in headspace gas composition, physiological loss in weight (PLW), ascorbic acid, texture, colour and subjective quality of pointed gourd were evaluated periodically during storage. The in-pack modified gaseous composition created a suitable headspace with low O2 and high CO2, which resulted in better retention of freshness and marketability of the vegetables in different packaging conditions. Shrink and vacuum packaging could not yield desired result under ambient storage because of high water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) of film and loss of turgidity.

Two tomato varieties (“Zouk” and “Camry”) were harvested in turning ripening stage and treated with hot air (60 °C) or UV radiation. Fruits were stored for 14 days in semi-controlled conditions (temperature range 14.4–19.9 °C, relative humidity range 35–55%), while non-treated tomatoes stored under the same conditions were used as a control. Sensory evaluation of samples was performed by trained panel, and instrumental measurements of color and texture were also carried out. Both postharvest treatments were effective in preventing tomato fruit spoilage. Hot air treatment resulted in better quality of tomato fruits in terms of sensory properties after two weeks of storage, but the UV irradiation resulted in favorable effects in terms of extension of tomato shelf life because it led to delayed ripening of tomato.",

The kinetics of blooming was studied as well as the effect of a PVC stretch film (with an O2TR – oxygen transmission rate – equal to 20,000 cm3 m−2 24 h−1 (23 °C, 0% RH, 1 bar of pO2) with or without perforation on myoglobin oxygenation and color changes. During storage in master bags, the scavengers allowed the progressive conversion of surface oxymyoglobin into deoxymyoglobin through the reversible formation of metmyoglobin (transient discoloration). The microflora shifted from aerobic to anaerobic with a predominance of lactic acid bacteria. The concentration of Brochotrix thermosphacta remained constant over the entire storage period. The removal of the trays from the master bag and the subsequent storage in air allowed the blooming of the meat within 60 min. The high O2TR value of the stretched PVC guaranteed rapid oxygen exchange, whereas the presence of the perforation did not contribute to a further increase in the superficial oxygenation. The quality decay during the display life was comparable to that of samples never stored in master bags. In conclusion, the use of low oxygen master bags was able to prolong the storage time on ground beef patties ensuring the current shelf life achieved with traditional packaging system.",

The steaks were held at 2 °C for 28 days of storage. A gradual tenderization of the meat was observed in all the packaging systems. The anoxic packaging systems (vacuum and MAP with CO) were less susceptible to the oxidative process and contributed to major structural changes in the steaks that are associated with improvements in meat tenderness. Steaks under MAP with high O2 level showed tenderness reduced. High O2 level accelerated the protein oxidation process, which can affect the enzymes responsible for meat tenderization. These results were corroborated by the myofibril fragmentation index (MFI), the proteolytic process, and the structural changes of the steaks as evidenced by SDS-PAGE and transmission electron micrographs (TEM) analysis.

     "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of a hybrid coating made of pullulan and a silicon-dioxide precursor to act as an oxygen barrier on polypropylene (PP) capsules used for single-dose ground coffee. PP capsules were first treated by an oxidizing flame to allow better adhesion of the water-based coating solution. The barrier performance of the capsules (uncoated and coated) was assessed by a non-invasive approach based on fluorescence quenching. The deposition of the coating (approximately 7.0 μm thick) led to a dramatic decrease in the oxygen permeation across empty capsules at 40 °C and 25% RH (uncoated capsules: 496.91 mL [package 24 h atm]−1; coated capsules: 14.01 mL [package 24 h atm]−1). In the presence of coffee inside the capsules, the barrier performance was even improved (pack permeability 1.87 mL [package 24 h atm]−1), which was ascribed to the residual oxygen inside the capsules at the beginning of the analysis. At 66% RH, the hybrid coating, while still acting as a good barrier, partially lost its performance due to the simultaneous swelling of the polymer matrix and the presence of fractures on the coating surface. The approach presented in this work can present opportunities for an alternative design of the packaging intended for coffee capsules, with a potential advantage also from an environmental perspective represented by the upstream reduction in the use of plastics.",

The inclusion of additives in matrix resulted in film's lower transparency, higher tensile strength and lower elongation at break. Adding lecithin, vitamin E powder or polysorbate into matrix did not change both CO2 and water vapor absorption capacities of agar-based films incorporated with Na2CO3.

The physicochemical properties of each of the different starch films were then evaluated and compared in order to determine their potential applications in the food industry. The amylose molecules in the cassava starch strongly interacted with glycerol resulting in an increase in the number of hydrogen bonds. This led to a slight shift upwards in the temperature required for the onset of the degradation of the cassava starch-based films, and even higher temperatures for degrading the films based on the modified starches. Films made from phosphated starches were more hydrophilic, producing an increase in solubility and crystallinity. Finally, the characteristics of the cassava films developed suggest that they would make good packaging materials, while films derived from cush-cush yam are more suitable as food coatings.",

Based on the inactivation and sublethal injury tests of S. Typhimurium by UV-C irradiation, 2 kJ/m2 UV-C was selected for the combined treatment. Non-inoculated and inoculated cherry tomatoes were irradiated with 2 kJ/m2 UV-C and then packaged under two different modified atmosphere conditions (passive and active) and stored for 9 d at 4 and 20 °C. As controls, non-irradiated cherry tomatoes packaged in perforated film bags were stored. When the inoculated cherry tomatoes that were irradiated with UV-C were packaged under an active modified atmosphere (5.3% CO2 + 5.5% O2), the S. Typhimurium populations were significantly reduced during storage at 4 °C compared to those of other treatments. Regarding the color, the combination of UV-C and active MAP delayed the change of Hunter b* and ΔE values in cherry tomatoes during storage at 4 °C. Regardless of treatment and packaging method, the cherry tomatoes stored at 4 °C exhibited a lower decrease of firmness compared to those stored at 20 °C. After 9 d of storage at 4 or 20 °C, there were significant differences in lycopene content and weight loss depending on storage temperature or gas composition in packaging film. Therefore, these results suggest that the combination of UV-C irradiation and active MAP can improve the microbial safety and extend the shelf life of cherry tomatoes during cold storage.",

     "abstract": "A non-destructive method that monitors changes in the freshness status of packed cod fillets has potential for the development of an intelligent packaging concept. The method is based on monitoring volatile compounds that dissolve and dissociate in the sensing aqueous phase. A mathematical model was developed to predict the freshness of the packed fish from the sensor signal (based on trimethylamine (TMA)). The model is based on physical and (bio)chemical principles of biological formation, mass transport, partitioning, and dissociation of TMA. The parameters in the model are derived partly from physical chemical properties, partly estimated from fitting the non-destructive sensor measurements in the aqueous phase and destructive TMA measurements in cod fillets. The model predicts a TMA increase in the aqueous phase comparable with sensor measurements from experimental storage trials. The initial freshness of fish is variable and taken into account in the model in the predictions of the freshness status of the packed fish.The model was used to test different scenarios for sensor design. This showed clearly that minimizing the aqueous phase will strongly improve the sensitivity of the sensor. Reducing the package headspace can further improve the sensitivity.In conclusion, the model can make accurate freshness predictions at a constant temperature of 0 °C and also in case of temporally temperature abuse, but needs a temperature-dependent correction for higher temperatures. Therefore combining the conductivity-sensor with a temperature sensor enables this model to be used in the development of an intelligent packaging to monitor the freshness of fish.",

     "abstract": "This paper investigates the effective of different packaging and preservation strategies on the shelf life of both cooked and raw black tiger prawns (Penaeus monodon). Prawn samples were cooked-chilled followed by either vacuum-packed or gas-flushed. Raw samples were used as control treatment. Each method of preservation was stored for 14 days at both 4 °C and 20 °C. Prawn samples were analysed for microbial, physical and sensorial properties for a 14 day storage period at storage temperatures of 4 and 20 °C. It was found that the method of vacuum-packing prawns was most efficient at preserving their sensorial and textural properties. This method also increased the lag phase of microbial growth at both storage temperatures. Therefore, from this study it can be concluded that the most effective method of preserving prawns is vacuum-packing prawns followed by storage at 4 °C as this keeps microbial counts down while at the same time preserving textural and sensorial qualities of the prawns.",

     "abstract": "Over the past few years, much interest has been placed into the investigation of increased barrier and mechanical properties of protein films via a multitude of approaches. Generally, these techniques involve modifications of interactions among protein molecules, such as ionic crosslinking using divalent ions. To evaluate the crosslinking effect of Ca2+ cations, films were made from calcium caseinate (CaCAS) and/or sodium caseinate (NaCAS). The production of caseinate thin films was carried out in two steps: first thermoplastic pellets were made using a co-rotating twin-screw extruder, then they were transformed into thin films (60 μm) using a classical film blowing machine. Tensile measurements were carried out at 60% relative humidity (RH) and 30 °C using a homemade testing machine which allows the change in environmental conditions during the test. The films mechanical resistance was found to be affected by the presence of Ca2+ ions; films made from CaCAS were rigid and less flexible than those based on NaCAS only. Water vapour permeability (WVP) and water diffusion were also measured. The reported data showed that films with only CaCAS or in mixture with NaCAS are less permeable to water vapour than those totally made from NaCAS. Likewise, the calcium ions were found to slow down the water diffusion.Films based on CaCAS only or in mixture with NaCAS appear to be more attractive for food packaging, and their applications could be extended to other packaging area.",

The incorporation of OEO into gelatin-chitosan film clearly improved antimicrobial activity. As regard to the film properties, the addition of OEO into gelatin-chitosan film significantly reduced mechanical property and increased light barrier, water vapor barrier. Film solubility of gelatin-chitosan film significantly decreased when containing 4% OEO (p ≤ 0.05). The SEM result revealed gelatin-chitosan-OEO film had rough cross-section. FTIR spectra indicated that no new bonds were formed in gelatin-chitosan-OEO film.

Pre-designed polypropylene film (38 μm) packages were used for storage study under MAP at 8 ± 1 °C temperature. The in-pack O2 and CO2 composition and respiration rate in the package headspace was monitored during storage in all the treatments. A modified atmosphere of 4.5% O2, 7.8% CO2 and 4.7% O2, 7.5% CO2 were achieved in the MA packages with and without moisture absorbent, respectively. The active packaging significantly reduced the respiration rate of fruit in the package. These packaged fruits were compared with non-packaged samples, which served as control stored at both ambient conditions (CS) and control at refrigerated temperature (CR). The quality of capsicums was assessed by physiological weight loss, color (L*, h* and C*) values, firmness, ascorbic acid, decay and marketability. The shelf life of bell pepper was extended to 49 days in active packages, 42 days with MA packages, as compared to 21 days with CR packages and 7 days with CS. Above all, by placing silica crystals sachets in the head space with moisture absorbing ability, could further extend the shelf life of capsicum 7 days in addition to modified atmosphere packaging alone with 97% fruit marketability.",

The thickness, solubility and water vapor permeability of films were also studied. Our results show that the enzyme mTGase allows the formation of a stiffer film, which behaves more like a solid material than does a film not cross linked with TGase. HPMC may well act as fillers of the protein network, affecting the mechanical spectra of the film as a function of the HPMC/SC ratio. In the presence of high HPMC concentrations the mechanical spectra of the blends may be similar to HPMC film. Only in the presence of high SC concentration does the order of relaxation (α) considerably increase from 0.0464 ± 0.002 to 0.111 ± 0.002 showing an increase in intermolecular cross-links.

We present a new approach that can potentially improve the physical properties of antibacterial packaging by enhancing the compatibility between the main polymeric ingredient of the package and an antibacterial additive. Enhance compatibility of chitosan, a polysaccharide with known antibacterial properties, was obtained by conjugating polyethylene glycol (PEG) onto chitosan to create PEGylated chitosan. We show that the PEG conjugation does not hamper the antibacterial properties of the chitosan. Moreover, the PEGylated chitosan film exhibited antibacterial activity which was absent in the native chitosan film. Improved compatibility with polyethylene films, leading to better transparency compared to films compounded with native chitosan, is demonstrated. The thermal behavior of the film is governed by the bulk polyethylene due to the small concentration of the PEGylated chitosan, yet the footprint of the additive is detectable. The addition of PEGylated chitosan decreases the Young modulus, which was assumed to be responsible for the compatibilizing effect of the grafted PEG side chains.",

     "abstract": "This study assessed the manufacture of polyamide (PA-6) composite casings based on silver–zinc crystals with potential application in sausages packaging. The antimicrobial activity of silver–zinc crystals was estimated by the minimum inhibitory concentration method for microbial strains related with the spoilage of meat products. PA-6 films were prepared as a multilayer film by bubble film sheet co-extrusion (130 °C–14,000 kPa), identified according to the layers distribution as control and active casings by adding 3% (w/w) of silver–zinc crystals to obtain a film with good barrier and mechanical properties. DSC, DMTA and SEM were also evaluated for determining the effects of microparticles in the polymeric matrix. Silver–zinc crystals inhibited the growth of various microbial strains, being Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028 which presented greatest resistance. Silver–zinc crystals were well impregnated in PA-6 films. Inclusion of silver–zinc crystals did not modify the mechanical properties and decreased the oxygen transmission rate of the films.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this work was to characterize, as packaging materials, antimicrobial films based on two different ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymers (EVOH 29 and EVOH 44) containing 5 and 10% lauril arginate (LAE). The characterization included optical, surface, thermal and barrier properties of the developed films, as well as the release of the agent into aqueous media. The results show that the addition of LAE did not produce relevant changes in optical, but reduced the films’ barrier properties to oxygen and water vapor, especially at high humidity conditions, and improved the wettability of the surface as demonstrated by the significant decrease in contact angle, both effects a consequence of the surfactant properties of the compound. The thermal properties confirmed that the distribution of LAE in the matrix was homogeneous, that the agent induced an antiplasticization effect and reduced the quality and percentage of the crystalline region, and that casting (or coating) is a suitable processing technology to reduce compound degradation. Finally, the release of LAE from EVOH films to water was characterized at 4 °C and 23 °C. This study showed that the agent was fully released into the food simulant from all films, although kinetically LAE diffusion was faster in EVOH 29 and at higher temperature. All these results show that the developed films present excellent functional properties and are able to release the antimicrobial agents suitably, making them promising materials for active food packaging applications.",

A comparative shelf life test was performed taking into consideration textural parameters, instrumental crumb colour parameters, crumb moisture and alkaline water retention capacity, considered as indirect indicators of bread staling. Sliced, durum wheat bread was packed into a system made of a thermoformed bottom, with thickness ranging from 225 to 275 μm, and a lid (121–125 μm), with comparable barrier properties. Results demonstrated that it is possible to reduce packaging by about 20% without affecting shelf life standards. The packaging systems showed comparable barrier performances, maintaining the modified atmosphere during 103 days. Texture profile analysis gave comparable results for packages at reduced thickness compared with conventional ones. Also, colour, alkaline water retention capacity and crumb moisture correlated well with bread ageing and did not significantly vary among packaging types.",

     "abstract": "The effectiveness of active coating on microbiological and decay of sensory quality in mozzarella cheese was investigated. The work was divided into two subsequent experimental steps: the first one was aimed at selecting the optimal active compound among different substances, such as potassium sorbate (PS), sodium benzoate (SB), calcium lactate (CL) and calcium ascorbate (CA). In the second trial, three different concentrations (1%, 2%, 3%, w/v) of the best selected compound (PS) were tested. All active compounds were dispersed in a sodium alginic acid solution before coating the cheese. Fresh mozzarella without coating was also used as the control. During storage at a temperature of 8 ± 1 °C, microbiological and sensory quality was monitored. Results obtained from the first step showed that CL and CA did not improve mozzarella cheese quality; whereas, the PS and SB showed good results. In the second trial, the coating with PS (3%) showed a certain inhibition on microbial proliferation and samples remained acceptable for 8 days with respect to the control that was refused after about 4 days.",

First, their efficacy was tested against some yeasts. By a sensory evaluation the thymol was discarded and the other three natural preservatives were tested in grape juice inoculated with a cocktail of selected yeasts. The most effective compound was trans-2-hexanal. A Central Composite Design (CCD) was also carried out to highlight possible synergistic effects between trans-2-hexanal, cinnamon oil and eugenol. Results showed that compounds were all effective against yeasts and their combination further reduced the active agent concentration. To finally assess the activity of the six most effective combinations of the CCD, a fresh grape juice added with compounds and stored at two storage temperatures, was monitored during time. Results confirmed the effectiveness of the three natural compounds in providing an immediate and significant protection of juice to yeast proliferation.",

Protein thiol concentration in breasts and thighs decreased significantly between 5 and 9 days storage in MAP-O2 compared to non-oxygen storage, and resulted in myosin heavy chain disulfide cross-links. Thiol loss and protein cross-link formation were more pronounced in thighs compared to breasts, and a similar tendency was seen for the formation of secondary lipid oxidation products. However, while breast stored in MAP-O2 clearly scored lower in tenderness and higher in rancidity compared to breast in non-oxygen storage, the effect of MAP-O2 for the sensory quality of thigh was negligible. These results show that thigh is more suitable for storage in MAP-O2 than breast, indicating that the negative effect MAP-O2 may have on the oxidative stability and sensory quality of meat varies between different muscles.",

Several quality parameters were monitored during the storage period. Fruit firmness, fungal decay and sensory evaluation were analyzed on days 1, 7, 14 and 21. Strawberries kept in active EMAP1 maintained their texture and appearance better than those packaged under air and EMAP2. Strawberries stored in active EMAP were firmer than those stored in air during the storage time (21 days). The irradiated strawberry samples were not attacked by Botrytis cinerea during 7 days. Irradiation and EMAP1 increased the postharvest life of strawberries to 14 days, without any attack of fungus or any change in their external appearance. Low-dose gamma irradiation in combination with EMAP will enable food processors to deliver larger amounts of high quality strawberry with extended shelf life.",

     "abstract": "Mono-component and composite bilayer and blend films composed of chitosan and whey protein were made. Colour, microstructure, water contact angles, swelling, water vapour sorption, barrier properties (oxygen, water vapour), water vapour diffusion coefficients and mechanical properties were determined. The influence of water vapour on barrier properties was studied in relation to the surface and structural properties. Mono-component and bilayer films were transparent with a homogeneous surface. Contrarily, blend films were translucent. Bilayer films had significantly lower water vapour permeability in comparison to mono-component and blend films. In all bilayer films, the air side (chitosan) was characterized by swelling, while the support side (whey protein) swelled after initial absorption. At low relative humidities, blend films were excellent barrier to oxygen and they completely lost their gas barrier performance in a humid environment. Bilayer films had enhanced mechanical resistance. The films with higher chitosan content showed higher capacity for elongation. Lamination and blending of chitosan and whey protein is a useful method to obtain new materials with desired functional properties.",

Sensory analysis of the samples was carried out to analyze color, odor, texture, drip loss and general appearance. Also the development of the gas atmosphere and the pH value was measured. The results showed that under both atmospheres the growths of all spoilage organisms and all sensory attributes were influenced by a perforation. Sensory shelf life was reduced under both atmospheres by 26% due to a perforation.",

     "publication date": "03-2014",
     "abstract": "Consumer's demand for sweet cherry has increased due to its sweet taste, attractive colour and high amounts of antioxidants. However, the fruit is highly perishable with a limited shelf life of 7–10 days, and in some cases fails to reach the consumer at optimal quality after being transported to the market. Loss of firmness, colour and flavour, stem discoloration, desiccation and mould growth limit their shelf life over extended periods of time. The harvest time, cultivar, handling, cooling practices and packaging greatly influence the shelf life of cherries. Developments in packaging e.g. modified atmosphere packaging have shown promising results in extending the shelf life of fresh produce including fresh cherries. Properly designed modified atmosphere packs can be exploited to prevent moisture loss, fungal growth, discoloration of pigments, and loss of bioactives during post-harvest storage. The article intends to review the critical factors that play an important role in determining the shelf life of sweet cherries. The combinations of modified atmosphere packaging with active packaging principles would further help to maintain the optimal quality of fresh cherries. This would further allow industries to assess long distance markets with high quality fruits.",
