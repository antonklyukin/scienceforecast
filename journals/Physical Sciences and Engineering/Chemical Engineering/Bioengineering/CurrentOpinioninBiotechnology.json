     "publication date": "12-2019",
     "abstract": "Granular hydrogels are emerging as a versatile and effective platform for tissue engineered constructs in regenerative medicine. The hydrogel microparticles (HMPs) that compose these materials exhibit particle jamming above a minimum packing fraction, which results in a bulk, yet dynamic, granular hydrogel scaffold. These injectable, microporous scaffolds possess self-assembling, shear-thinning, and self-healing properties. Recently, they have been utilized as cell cultures platforms and extracellular matrix mimics with remarkable success in promoting cellular infiltration and subsequent tissue remodeling in vivo. Furthermore, the modular nature of granular hydrogels accommodates heterogeneous HMP assembly, where varying HMPs have been fabricated to target distinct biological processes or deliver unique cargo. Such multifunctional materials offer enormous potential for capturing the structural and biofunctional complexity observed in native human tissue.",

     "abstract": "For a long time, glycoprotein production has been limited by the inherent properties of production hosts. Glycosylation of biopharmaceuticals has been regarded as a necessary evil, often needed for protein folding or function, but also a source of heterogeneity, complicating downstream processing and product characterization. This has strongly determined the choice of production hosts. Over the last few decades, numerous glycoengineering efforts have helped solving this problem. Moreover, insights from fundamental studies have made it possible to improve therapeutic protein functionality through careful glycoengineering. Here, we will focus on how production host and in vitro glycoengineering approaches allow to design biopharmaceuticals with glycans that impart improved functionality. An important branch of research explores how glycosylation can be tuned to improve pharmacokinetics and reduce glycan heterogeneity of therapeutics. Furthermore, antibody glycoengineering to obtain homogeneous, defined glycan structures has been a major focus. An example of this is the production of Fc glycans without core fucose, exhibiting tremendously improved Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity (ADCC). In the last part, glycoforms that allow for improved (subcellular) targeting and cellular uptake, a field that opens possibilities for enzyme replacement therapies and vaccine development, will be highlighted.",

In the case of mutations in individual genes that cause them to be incorrectly spliced, engineered splicing factors can be introduced to correct splicing of these aberrant transcripts and reduce the effects of the disease phenotype. Mutations that occur in certain splicing factor genes themselves have been implicated in many cancers, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes. Small molecules that target splicing factors have been developed as therapies to preferentially induce apoptosis in these cancer cells. Specifically, drugs targeting the splicing factor SF3B1 have led to recent clinical trials. Here, we review the role of alternative splicing in disease, approaches to rescue incorrect splicing using engineered splicing factors, and small molecule splicing inhibitors developed to treat hematological cancers.",

Among the most significant challenges that limit AAV’s utility, however, is the immune response it elicits. Antibodies elicited by prior exposure to natural virus or vector can bind to an AAV vector, preventing it from entering the cell. Furthermore, even if AAV manages to infect a target cell, these cells can then be attenuated by lymphocytes. Improvements in our understanding of how the immune system responds to AAV have guided engineering of the capsid to reduce those responses, yielding capsid variants that are much stealthier and more effective.

Examples include the use of human antibody repertoire sequence data to pair antibody heavy and light chains, comprehensive mutational analysis for engineering antibody specificity, and the use of ancestral and inter-species sequence data to engineer simultaneous improvements in enzyme catalytic efficiency and stability.

     "abstract": "Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell-based bioproduction of recombinant proteins can now routinely achieve >5 g/L titers in fed-batches. This progress is partly due to the rapid adaptability of CHO cells to various genetic manipulations and changing process conditions. An inherently plastic genome allows for this adaptability; however, it also gives CHO cells the propensity for genomic rearrangements. In combination with the genomic and metabolic demand of high producer cells, CHO cell plasticity manifests itself in the bioproduction process as cell line instability, by way of a decline in productivity and product quality. In this review, we provide a definition for titer and quality stability and discuss the main causes of the CHO instability phenomenon and advances in clone selection and genetic manipulations. We also discuss advances in systems biology efforts that can provide new strategies for early prediction of CHO cell instability, which will help to identify multi-gram per liter titer cell lines that can maintain production stability and reproducible product quality over extended culture durations.",

However, macrophages make up a majority of immune cell infiltrates into tumors, creating natural targets for immunotherapies able to direct macrophages away from tumor-supportive functions and toward anti-tumor phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate that toll-like receptors (TLRs) – pathways that quickly trigger early immune responses – play an important role in polarizing macrophages. Here, we present emerging ways in which TLR signaling is being manipulated in macrophages to create new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, we discuss approaches to deliver TLR agonists, to leverage biomaterials in these therapies, and to couple TLR-based approaches with other frontline treatments as combination cancer therapies.",

Moreover, techniques such as focused ultrasound can further disrupt the BBB in diseased regions. This review focuses on strategies that leverage such BBB disruption for delivering nanocarriers to the central nervous system (CNS). BBB disruption, as it relates to nanocarrier delivery, will be discussed in the context of acute pathologies such as stroke and traumatic brain injury, as well as chronic pathologies such as brain tumors, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease.

They are one of the most important probes for determining how proteins function under normal and pathophysiological conditions. Abs are required for the quantification of targets, detection of temporal and spatial patterns of protein expression in cells and tissues, and identification of interacting partners and their biological activities. Their remarkable specificity and unique binding properties can facilitate three-dimensional structure determination using X-ray crystallography and electron cryomicroscopy. While hybridoma technology that involves animal immunization is often productive, many antigen targets do not generate useful Abs. This is particularly true if unique states of the target or critical non-immunogenic target sequences need to be recognized by the Abs. By using the methods of recombinant antibody generation, identification, and engineering, these ‘hybridoma-refractory’ antigens can be readily targeted. Specific, reproducible, and renewable recombinant Abs are proving to be invaluable reagents in applications ranging from biological discovery to structure determination of challenging macromolecules.",

     "abstract": "Development of a robust biologic drug product is accomplished by extensive formulation and process development screening studies; however, even in the most optimal formulation, a protein can undergo spontaneous degradation during manufacture, storage, and clinical use. Chemical changes to amino acid residues, such as oxidation of methionine or tryptophan, or changes in charge such as deamidation or carbonylation, can induce conformational changes in the overall protein structure, potentially leading to changes in physical – in addition to chemical – stability. Oxidation is often caused by light exposure or the presence of metal ions or peroxides. Asparagine deamidation is more likely to occur at higher pH and/or elevated temperature. Mechanical and interfacial stresses during manufacturing can lead to physical instabilities (i.e. various forms of aggregation). A well-defined manufacturing process and effective in-process controls are essential in minimizing chemical and physical instabilities, enabling robust production and distribution of a safe and efficacious drug product. In this work, the authors provide a review of developments in these areas over the past two years, with emphasis on manufacturability of therapeutically relevant proteins and protein-based drug products.",

Moreover, metabolic engineering is bound to benefit from advances in cell-free expression systems, either for faster prototyping of biosensors or for whole-pathway optimization, making it both a means and an end in biosensor design.",

In the cell wall, monomers move freely, until they encounter stationary oxidative enzymes that determine where the lignin polymer forms. However, it remains unclear how lignin monomers are trafficked from inside the cell to the cell wall. Although multiple lines of circumstantial evidence implicate transporters, additional possible mechanisms include the diffusion of monomers across lipid bilayers and the release of monolignol glucosides stored in vacuoles. There are therefore potentially diverse and overlapping mechanisms of monolignol export.",

Plants can precisely control when, where, and which types of lignin polymers are assembled at tissue and cellular levels, but do not control the polymers’ exact chemical structures per se.

This invention has directly contributed to the dominance of vascular plants in the Earth’s flora, and has had a profound impact on the establishment of the rich terrestrial ecosystems as we know them today.

The latter process can be expedited by valorizing lignin, which entails making products from lignin that generate additional revenues for biorefineries so that the production of biofuels becomes more competitive with gasoline. Industrially produced lignin is considered a low-value material that is used as a boiler fuel to generate heat and electricity, and as an ingredient of adhesives, cement, and drilling fluids for underwater oil wells. The aromatic nature of lignin, its ability to participate in radical-mediated cross-linking reactions, the many functional groups available for derivatization or chemical reactions, and its amenability to existing procedures for making thermoplastics, make it attractive as an additive to polymers to enhance UV-tolerance and/or other physico-chemical properties. Lignin can also be used as the basis for various nanomaterials, either per se or in combination with other polymers.

Consequently, decomposition or removal of lignin is a crucial step to utilize cell wall components.

Microbial enzymes responsible for the former could be attractive tools for lignin decomposition during biomass pretreatment, and enzymes involved in the latter are useful for lignin valorization through the production of value-added chemicals.

     "abstract": "Reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) of lignocellulose is an emerging biorefinery scheme that combines biomass fractionation with lignin depolymerisation. Central to this scheme is the integration of heterogeneous catalysis, which overcomes the tendency of lignin to repolymerise. Ultimately, this leads to a low-Mw lignin oil comprising a handful of lignin-derived monophenolics in close-to-theoretical yield, as well as a carbohydrate pulp. Both product streams are considered to be valuable resources for the bio-based chemical industry. This Opinion article sheds light on recently achieved milestones and consequent research opportunities. More specifically, mechanistic studies have established a general understanding of the elementary RCF steps, which include (i) lignin extraction, (ii) solvolytic and catalytic depolymerisation and (iii) stabilisation. This insight forms the foundation for recently developed flow-through RCF. Compared to traditional batch, flow-through RCF has the advantage of (i) separating the solvolytic steps from the catalytic steps and (ii) being a semi-continuous process; both of which are beneficial for research purposes and for industrial operation. Although RCF has originally been developed for ‘virgin’ biomass, researchers have just begun to explore alternative feedstocks. Low-value biomass sources such as agricultural residues, waste wood and bark, are cheap and abundant but are also often more complex. On the other side of the feedstock spectrum are high-value bio-engineered crops, specifically tailored for biorefinery purposes. Advantageous for RCF are feedstocks designed to (i) increase the total monomer yield, (ii) extract lignin more easily, and/or (iii) yield unconventional, high-value products (e.g. alkylated catechols derived from C-lignin). Taking a look at the bigger picture, this Opinion article highlights the multidisciplinary nature of RCF.

Furthermore, the binding-linked reactions that strongly affect the observed thermodynamic parameters and must be dissected to obtain the intrinsic parameters that are necessary for the structure-based rational drug design are being demonstrated using inhibitors of Hsp90, an anticancer target protein.",

Investigating chromatin factors indicates that DNA cytosine-5 methylation does not directly block Cas9 binding. Nucleosomes, however, can completely block Cas9 access to DNA in cell-free assays and present a substantial hurdle in vivo. In addition to being associated with an open chromatin state, active transcription can directly stimulate DNA cleavage by influencing Cas9 release rates in a strand-specific manner.

If metabolism is steady but isotope labeling is not allowed to fully equilibrate, isotopically nonstationary metabolic flux analysis (INST-MFA) can be used to estimate fluxes. This requires solution of differential equations that describe the time-dependent labeling of network metabolites, while iteratively adjusting the flux and pool size parameters to match the transient labeling measurements. INST-MFA holds a number of unique advantages over approaches that rely solely upon steady-state isotope enrichments. First, INST-MFA can be applied to estimate fluxes in autotrophic systems, which consume only single-carbon substrates. Second, INST-MFA is ideally suited to systems that label slowly due to the presence of large intermediate pools or pathway bottlenecks. Finally, INST-MFA provides increased measurement sensitivity to estimate reversible exchange fluxes and metabolite pool sizes, which represents a potential framework for integrating metabolomic analysis with 13C flux analysis.

Whereas nontargeted, discovery proteomics uncovers differences in the proteomic landscape under different conditions, targeted proteomics has been developed to overcome the limitations of this approach with regard to quantitation. In addition to technical advances in instruments and informatics tools, the advent of the synthetic proteome composed of synthetic peptides or recombinant proteins has advanced the adoption of targeted proteomics across a wide range of research fields. Targeted proteomics can now be applied to measurement of the dynamics of any proteins of interest under a variety of conditions as well as to estimation of the absolute abundance or stoichiometry of proteins in a given network. Multiplexed targeted proteomics assays of high reproducibility and accuracy can provide insight at the quantitative level into entire networks that govern biological phenomena or diseases. Such assays will establish a new paradigm for data-driven science.",

The hierarchical model of chromatin organization in the 3D nuclear space encompasses different topologies at diverse scale lengths, with chromosomes occupying distinct volumes, further organized in compartments, inside which the chromatin fibers fold into large domains and short-range loops. In the recent years, the combination of chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques and high-throughput sequencing allowed probing chromatin spatial organization at the whole genome-scale. 3C-based methods produce enormous amounts of genomic data that are analyzed using ad-hoc computational procedures.

     "abstract": "Viral clearance and inactivation are critical steps in ensuring the safety of biological products derived from mammalian cell culture and are a component of an adventitious agent control strategy which spans both upstream and downstream processes. Although these approaches have been sufficient to support the development of biologics to date, the empirical and semi-quantitative nature of the approach leaves some potential gaps. For example, the concept of performing a quantitative risk assessment for the downstream components of virus safety was introduced in ICH Q5A for XMuLV. An ideal future state would be to perform a similar quantitative risk assessment for a range of viruses based on an assessment of potential virus risk in both upstream and downstream processes. This assessment combined with an integrated control strategy (including monitoring) would be extremely beneficial in minimizing potential adventitious agent risks. Significant progress has been achieved towards this goal in the last several years including recent advances in quantification of virus sequences in cell banks (ADVTIG), development of truly modular or generic viral clearance claims for specific unit operations, enhanced controls of upstream media (HTST/nanofiltration) and the use of RVLP for in-process monitoring. The recent shift towards continuous processing has the potential to enhance the criticality of in-line monitoring and the complexity of viral clearance and inactivation (owing to a wide range of potential ‘worst case’ viral clearance scenarios). However, gaps exist in, firstly, the ability to quantify potential virus risk levels in process streams in real-time, secondly, mechanistic understanding of virus/chromatography media interactions, and thirdly, mechanistic understanding of virus/filter interactions. Some new technologies may also need to be developed to allow for real-time confirmation of virus inactivation and clearance to support process development (both batch and continuous) and assessment of the impact of process deviations during manufacturing.This review paper provides an overview of the current state of an overall integrated control strategy for upstream and downstream processing and highlights the investments that could be pursued to achieve the future state of a quantitative virus risk assessment for a range of viruses. One potential approach to address these gaps is the use of data mining from large, comprehensive and diverse data sets to establish heuristic rules for virus detection, clearance and inactivation followed by specific hypothesis-driven experiments for cases that fall outside of the normal paradigm. Once this approach reaches a mature state suitable for implementation, there is an opportunity to update regulatory guidance (e.g. ICH Q5A) accordingly.",

The synthesis of these amino acids is supported by a high flux of glucose through the glycolytic pathway in combination with a derepression of the enzymes of the branched chain amino acid pathway, for example, when leucine-rich proteins are produced. Avoiding the synthesis and misincorporation of these amino acids has been challenging, especially in large-scale pharmaceutical processes where the problem is boosted by the typical fed-batch production and the technical limitation of mass transfer in the bioreactors.Despite its industrial importance, so far this issue has not been discussed comprehensively. Therefore this paper reviews, firstly, the specific pathway of the non-canonical branched chain amino acids starting at pyruvate, secondly, the molecular factors for their misincorporation, and thirdly, approaches to avoid this misincoporation.

Here we review a variety of potential scaffolds for building a synthetic cell. We categorize them as membranous structures (liposomes, fatty acid vesicles, polymersomes), emulsions (droplets and colloidosomes), and membrane-less coacervates. We discuss recent advances for each of them, and explore their salient features as candidates for designing synthetic cells.",

Recent technological advances have given an unprecedented insight into the sources of this variation, pointing towards our genome and microbiome as potentially and previously under-explored culprits contributing to individually unique dietary responses. Variations in our genome influence the bioavailability and metabolism of nutrients between individuals, while inter-individual compositional variation of commensal gut microbiota leads to different microbe functional potential, metabolite production and metabolism modulation.

We argue here that understanding and engineering microbial communities requires a holistic view that considers not only species–species, but also species–environment interactions, and feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary dynamics (eco-evo feedbacks). Due this multi-level nature of interactions, we predict that approaches aimed soley at altering specific species populations in a community (through strain enrichment or inhibition), would only have a transient impact, and species–environment and eco-evo feedbacks would eventually drive the microbial community to its original state. We propose a higher-level engineering approach that is based on thermodynamics of microbial growth, and that considers specifically microbial redox biochemistry. Within this approach, the emphasis is on enforcing specific environmental conditions onto the community. These are expected to generate higher-level thermodynamic bounds onto the system, which the community structure and function can then adapt to. We believe that the resulting end-state can be ecologically and evolutionarily stable, mimicking the natural states of complex communities.

These novel nitrifiers have been identified in a range of engineered, natural freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, challenging previously held knowledge on the key microorganisms and biochemical pathways controlling nitrification.

     "abstract": "Nitrogen is one of the most important nutrients for plant growth and hence heavily applied in agricultural systems via fertilization. Nitrification, that is, the conversion of ammonium via nitrite to nitrate by soil microorganisms, however, leads to nitrate leaching and gaseous nitrous oxide production and as such to an up to 50% loss of nitrogen availability for the plant. Nitrate leaching also results in eutrophication of groundwater, drinking water and recreational waters, toxic algal blooms and biodiversity loss, while nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 300× greater than carbon dioxide. Logically, inhibition of nitrification is an important strategy used in agriculture to reduce nitrogen losses, and contributes to a more environmental-friendly practice. However, recently identified and crucial players in nitrification, that is, ammonia-oxidizing archaea and comammox bacteria, seem to be under-investigated in this respect. In this review, we give an update on the different pathways in ammonia oxidation, the relevance for agriculture and the interaction with nitrification inhibitors.

     "abstract": "Carbon dioxide enters the biosphere via one of two mechanisms: carboxylation, in which CO2 is attached to an existing metabolite, or reduction, in which CO2 is converted to formate or carbon monoxide before further assimilation. Here, we focus on the latter mechanism which usually receives less attention. To better understand the possible advantages of the ‘reduction-first’ approach, we compare the two general strategies according to the kinetics of the CO2-capturing enzymes, and the resource consumption of the subsequent pathways. We show that the best CO2 reducing enzymes can compete with the best carboxylases. We further demonstrate that pathways that fix CO2 by first reducing it to formate could have an advantage over the majority of their carboxylation-only counterparts in terms of ATP-efficiency and hence biomass yield. We discuss and elaborate on the challenges of implementing ‘reduction-first’ pathways, including the thermodynamic barrier of CO2 reduction. We believe that pathways based on CO2 reduction are a valuable addition to nature's arsenal for capturing inorganic carbon and could provide promising metabolic solutions that have been previously overlooked.",

Plants are potentially exploitable ‘green’ chemical factories, with vast chemical diversity that can be used for the discovery and production of food, feed, medicines and biomaterials. Despite notable advances, plant based production under real-life scenarios remains, in most cases, economically uncompetitive when compared to inherently non-sustainable petrochemical based processes. In the present review the strategies available and those emerging will be described. Furthermore, how can the new evolving molecular tools such as genome editing be utilised to create a new paradigm of plant-based production?

The SPX domain harbors a basic surface binding Pi at low affinity and inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) at high affinity. Genetic and biochemical studies revealed that PP-InsPs serve as ligands for the SPX domain. Residues in the PHO1 SPX domain involved in PP-InsPs binding are critical for its Pi export activity, and the interaction between SPX proteins and the PHR1 transcription factor, which results in PHR1 inactivation, is promoted by PP-InsPs. Changes in PP-InsPs levels in response to Pi deficiency may thus contribute to the adaptation of plants to stress via the modulation of the activity of SPX-containing proteins and their interactors. Modulating PP-InsP levels or the affinity/specificity of the SPX domain for PP-InsP could potentially be used to engineer crops to maintain high yield under reduced Pi fertilizer input.",

     "abstract": "Immunotherapies are yielding effective treatments for several previously untreatable cancers. Until recently, vaccines and adoptive cell therapies have been designed to target public tumor antigens common to multiple patients rather than private antigens specific to a single patient. Due to the difficulty of identifying public antigens that are expressed exclusively on tumor cells, these studies have yielded both clinical successes and serious immune-related adverse events. Multiple avenues of research now underscore the centrality of tumor-specific mutated private antigens to endogenous anti-tumor immunity. Immunotherapies that target these neoantigens may enable safer and more durable tumor regression, but personalized targeting presents a number of challenges. Foremost among these is to develop processes that accelerate advancement from neoantigen discovery to use of these neoantigens as vaccines or as targets for adoptive cell therapies. Exome sequencing has facilitated discovery of neoantigens for melanoma and other highly mutated cancers. New technologies – possibly proceeding from T cell receptor repertoire sequencing – are needed to identify antigens for cancers with low mutational burden and few neoantigens.

For example, dedicated enzymes accurately dictate the site of post-translational modifications in signaling proteins, and ribosomes precisely link the C-terminal carboxylic acid of one unprotected amino acid with the N-terminal amino group of the other amino acid through spatially confined proximity. For many years, chemists have been striving to achieve site selectivity on biomolecules by mimicking nature. Driven by the development of chemoselective protein conjugation reactions, enzymology and protein–protein interactions, the past decade has witnessed a boom in site-selective protein conjugation reactions. (In this review, a site-selective protein conjugation reaction is defined as an organic reaction that targets a single amino acid instead of a kind of amino acids in a protein or a proteome under physiological conditions, for example, a single cysteine residue among all of the cysteines.) In this review, we summarize the recent advancements of bioconjugation reactions that demonstrate this feature of precise site selectivity, focusing on the reactions of the proteinogenic amino acids (excluding those at non-coded or non-proteinogenic amino acids that are introduced to proteins through genetic manipulations).",

Chondrocytes from fully mature nasal septum cartilage in adults are also derivatives of neural crest cells and were recently demonstrated to be able not only to maintain functionality across serial cloning, as surrogate self-renewal test, but also to respond and adapt to heterotopic transplantation sites. Based on these findings, cartilage grafts engineered by nasal chondrocytes were clinically used to reconstitute the nasal alar lobule and to repair articular cartilage defects. This article discusses further perspectives of potential clinical utility for nasal chondrocytes in musculoskeletal regeneration.

Similar to other biopolymers such as polysaccharides, polypeptides, and ribonucleic acids, lignin polymers are derived from multiple types of monomeric units. However, lignin’s renowned recalcitrance is largely attributable to its racemic nature and the variety of covalent inter-unit linkages through which its aromatic monomers are linked. Indeed, unlike other biopolymers whose monomers are consistently inter-linked by a single type of covalent bond, the monomeric units in lignin are linked via non-enzymatic, combinatorial radical coupling reactions that give rise to a variety of inter-unit covalent bonds in mildly branched racemic polymers. Yet, despite the chemical complexity and stability of lignin, significant strides have been made in recent years to identify routes through which valued commodities can be derived from it. This paper discusses emerging biological and biochemical means through which degradation of lignin to aromatic monomers can lead to the derivation of commercially valuable products.",

This investment has helped create new metabolic engineering and synthetic biology approaches, novel homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, and chemical and biological routes that convert sugars, lignin, and waste products such as glycerol into hydrocarbon fuels and valuable chemicals. With the exception of ethanol, economical biofuels processes have yet to be realized. A potentially viable way forward is the integration of biological and chemical catalysis into processes that exploit the inherent advantages of each technology while circumventing their disadvantages. Microbial fermentation excels at converting sugars from low-cost raw materials streams into simple alcohols, acids, and other reactive intermediates that can be condensed into highly reduced, long and branched chain hydrocarbons and other industrially useful compounds. Chemical catalysis most often requires clean feed streams to avoid catalyst deactivation, but the chemical and petroleum industries have developed large scale processes for C–C coupling, hydrogenation, and deoxygenation that are driven by low grade heat and low-cost feeds such as hydrogen derived from natural gas. In this context, we suggest that there is a reasonably clear route to the high yield synthesis of biofuels from biomass- or otherwise derived-fermentable sugars: the microbial production of reactive intermediates that can be extracted or separated into clean feed stream for upgrading by chemical catalysis. When coupled with new metabolic engineering strategies that maximize carbon and energy yields during fermentation, biomass-to-fuels processes may yet be realized.",

     "abstract": "Man-made xenobiotics, whose potential toxicological effects are not fully understood, are oversaturating the already-contaminated environment. Due to the rate of toxicant accumulation, unmanaged disposal, and unknown adverse effects to the environment and the human population, there is a crucial need to screen for environmental toxicants. Animal models and in vitro models are ineffective models in predicting in vivo responses due to inter-species difference and/or lack of physiologically-relevant 3D tissue environment. Such conventional screening assays possess limitations that prevent dynamic understanding of toxicants and their metabolites produced in the human body. Organ-on-a-chip systems can recapitulate in vivo like environment and subsequently in vivo like responses generating a realistic mock-up of human organs of interest, which can potentially provide human physiology-relevant models for studying environmental toxicology. Feasibility, tunability, and low-maintenance features of organ-on-chips can also make possible to construct an interconnected network of multiple-organs-on-chip toward a realistic human-on-a-chip system. Such interconnected organ-on-a-chip network can be efficiently utilized for toxicological studies by enabling the study of metabolism, collective response, and fate of toxicants through its journey in the human body. Further advancements can address the challenges of this technology, which potentiates high predictive power for environmental toxicology studies.",

The primary management is a lifelong diet restricted in protein from natural foods in combination with medical foods comprised mixtures of synthetic amino acids. Compliance is often poor after childhood leading to neuropsychological sequela. Glycomacropeptide, an intact 64 amino acid glycophosphopeptide isolated from cheese whey, provides a new paradigm for the management of phenylketonuria and tyrosinemia because glycomacropeptide contains no Phe and Tyr in its pure form, and is also a prebiotic. Medical foods made from glycomacropeptide have been used successfully for the management of phenylketonuria and tyrosinemia. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate that intact protein from glycomacropeptide provides a more acceptable and physiologic source of defined protein compared to amino acids in medical foods. For example, harmful gut bacteria were reduced, beneficial short chain fatty acids increased, renal workload decreased, protein utilization increased, and bone fragility decreased using intact protein versus amino acids. Advances in biotechnology will propel the transition from synthetic amino acids to intact proteins for the management of inherited metabolic disorders.",

Biofortification, the process of enhancing micronutrient content and bioavailability in staple crops, represents an exciting sustainable food-based strategy to combat and prevent iron deficiency, particularly in resource-limited settings. In this review, we examine the evidence to date of the efficacy of iron-biofortified staple food crops on improving iron status in at-risk populations, including rice, pearl millet, and beans. Three randomized efficacy trials of iron biofortified interventions were included in this analysis, conducted in the Philippines, India, and Rwanda. Iron status (hemoglobin, serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), C-reactive protein, alpha-1 acid glycoprotein) was measured at enrollment, midline, and endline in each trial. The primary outcomes evaluated included hemoglobin, serum ferritin, sTfR, and total body iron. A meta-analysis using random effects models was conducted to examine the effects of interventions on hematological outcomes, with the DerSimonian and Laird method. In meta-analyses of data from the three trials, iron-biofortified interventions significantly increased serum ferritin concentrations and total body iron. Evidence to date from randomized trials suggest that iron-biofortified crops are an efficacious intervention to improve iron status. In particular, findings from all three trials also indicate that the effects of biofortified staple crops were highest among individuals who were iron deficient at baseline, suggesting the greatest potential to benefit. Assessment of functional outcomes and consideration of other high-risk populations such as young children, are warranted to elucidate the impact of iron-biofortified interventions on human health.",

This review describes the current knowledge regarding iodine physiology in higher plants, and provides updates on recent agronomic and metabolic engineering strategies of biofortification. Whereas the direct administration of iodine is effective to increase the iodine content in many plant species, a more sophisticated genetic engineering approach seems to be necessary for the iodine biofortification of some important staple crops.",

Data from the first plants biofortified with minerals and vitamins provide evidence that the way in which nutrients are presented can affect how they are processed and utilized in the human body.

Despite the fact that lignin depolymerization has long been studied, the intrinsic heterogeneity of lignin typically leads to heterogeneous streams of aromatic compounds, which in turn present significant technical challenges when attempting to produce lignin-derived chemicals where purity is often a concern. In Nature, microorganisms often encounter this same problem during biomass turnover wherein powerful oxidative enzymes produce heterogeneous slates of aromatics compounds. Some microbes have evolved metabolic pathways to convert these aromatic species via ‘upper pathways’ into central intermediates, which can then be funneled through ‘lower pathways’ into central carbon metabolism in a process we dubbed ‘biological funneling’. This funneling approach offers a direct, biological solution to overcome heterogeneity problems in lignin valorization for the modern biorefinery. Coupled to targeted separations and downstream chemical catalysis, this concept offers the ability to produce a wide range of molecules from lignin. This perspective describes research opportunities and challenges ahead for this new field of research, which holds significant promise towards a biorefinery concept wherein polysaccharides and lignin are treated as equally valuable feedstocks. In particular, we discuss tailoring the lignin substrate for microbial utilization, host selection for biological funneling, ligninolytic enzyme–microbe synergy, metabolic engineering, expanding substrate specificity for biological funneling, and process integration, each of which presents key challenges. Ultimately, for biological solutions to lignin valorization to be viable, multiple questions in each of these areas will need to be addressed, making biological lignin valorization a multidisciplinary, co-design problem.",

To address this critical aspect in environmental biogeochemistry, different methods involving stable isotope probing (SIP) and detection of the isotope label in a variety of molecular compounds have been developed. Here we review recent progress in lipid-SIP, a technique that combines the assimilation of specific 13C-labeled metabolic substrates such as inorganic carbon, methane, glucose and amino acids into diagnostic membrane lipid compounds. Using the structural characteristics of certain lipid types in combination with genetic molecular techniques, the SIP approach reveals the activity and function of distinct microbial groups in the environment. More recently, deuterium labeling in the form of deuterated water (D2O) extended the lipid-SIP portfolio. Since lipid biosynthetic pathways involve hydrogen (H+) uptake from water, lipid production can be inferred from the detection of D-assimilation into these compounds. Furthermore, by combining D2O and 13C-inorganic carbon (IC) labeling in a dual-SIP approach, rates of auto- and heterotrophic carbon fixation can be estimated.

In biochemical reactions, rate limitation such as uptake into cells, substrate transport in cells and binding to enzymes as well as equilibrium isotope effects (EIE) are modifying the observed isotope fractionation associated with the bond cleavage reactions, thus, complicating mechanistic interpretation of isotope effect. One way for improved analysis of bond cleavage reactions by isotope effects reactions is the combination of isotope effects from two or more elements forming the reactive organic moieties where bond change reaction takes place as indicator. A further option is the combination of enantiomeric with isotope fractionation as complementary indicator for enzymatic bond cleavage reaction governing biodegradation.

Fractionation factors are sufficiently different for some central biochemical pathways in anaerobic degradation of organic carbon. Thus, it is possible to quantify the relative contribution of CH4 production by hydrogenotrophic or aceticlastic methanogenic pathways, and of acetate formation by chemolithotrophic (acetyl-CoA synthase) or heterotrophic (fermentation) pathways. In addition, stable isotope analysis may allow the differentiation between different organic substrates used for degradation, for example, the relative contribution of root exudation versus soil organic matter degradation, provided the different substrates are sufficiently distinct in their isotopic compositions (e.g., mixture of C3 and C4 plants) and the carbon conversion pathways display only small fractionation factors or are identical for the different substrates.",

Stem cells are typically cultured outside the body to increase cell number or differentiate the cells into mature cell types. In order to maximize the regenerative potential of these cells, there is a need to understand cell–material interactions that direct cell behavior and cell–material dynamics. Most synthetic surfaces used for growth and differentiation of cells in the lab are impractical and cost prohibitive in clinical labs. This review focuses on the modification of low cost polymer substrates that are already widely used for cell culture so that they may be used to control and understand cell–material interactions. In addition, we discuss the ability of cells to exert dynamic control over the microenvironment leading to a more complex, less controlled surface.",

Both fronts of advance have exposed a rich heterogeneity of cell states within uniform cell populations in many biological contexts, producing a new kind of data that has triggered computational analysis methods for data visualization, dimensionality reduction, and cluster (subpopulation) identification.

The pretreatment step within a biorefinery process is essential for recovering carbohydrates, but different techniques and intensities have a variety of effects on lignin. Acidic and alkaline pretreatments have been shown to produce diverse lignins based on delignification chemistry. The valorization potential of pretreated lignin is affected by its chemical structure, which is known to degrade, including inter-lignin condensation under high-severity pretreatment. Co-valorization of lignin and carbohydrates will require dampening of pretreatment intensities to avoid such effects, in spite of tradeoffs in carbohydrate production.",

Biogas can be burnt as such in engines to produce electricity and heat or upgraded into biomethane. Biomethane is a drop-in fuel that can be injected in the natural gas grid or utilised as a transport fuel. While a wide array of biomass feedstock can be degraded into biogas, unconverted lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose end up in the co-product digestate leaving a large portion of chemical energy unutilised. Pyrolysis (Py) transforms in a single step and without chemical reagents the lignocellulose matrix into gaseous (syngas), liquid (bio-oil, pyrolysis oil) and solid (biochar) fractions for the development of renewable fuels and materials. The Py route applied downstream to AD is actively investigated in order to valorise the solid digestate presently destined only for soil applications. Coupling Py upstream to AD is an emerging field of research aimed at expanding the feedstock towards biologically recalcitrant substrates (wood, paper, sludge). The biomethanation potential was demonstrated for gaseous (H2/CO) and water soluble pyrolysis products, while the influence of insoluble pyrolytic lignin remains fairly unexplored. Biochar can promote the production of biomethane by acting as a support for microorganism colonisation, conductor for direct interspecies electron transfer, sorbent for hydrophobic inhibitors, and reactant for in situ biogas upgrading. Enhancing the advantages (carbon source) over the side effects (toxicity) of Py fractions represents the main challenge of Py-AD. This can be addressed by increasing the selectivity of the thermochemical process or improving the ecological flexibility of mixed bacterial consortia towards chemically complex environments.",

The most important efforts target the efficiency of the oleaginous machinery, via overexpression of key-enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis, as well as the minimization of lipid degradation, by repressing genes involved in the β-oxidation pathway. The production of specific PUFAs is approached by homologous or heterologous expression of specific desaturases and elongases involved in PUFA biosynthesis in oleaginous microorganisms. New perspectives, such as the production of triacylglycerols of specific structure and the employment of adaptive experimental evolution for creating robust oleaginous strains able to produce PUFAs are also discussed.",

Transgenes carried on an independent chromosome would facilitate conferring many new properties to plants and using minichromosomes as genetic tools. The favored method for producing plant minichromosomes is telomere-mediated chromosomal truncation because the epigenetic nature of centromere function prevents using centromere sequences to confer the ability to organize a kinetochore when reintroduced into plant cells. Because haploid induction procedures are not always complete in eliminating one parental genome, chromosomes from the inducer lines are often present in plants that are otherwise haploid. This fact suggests that minichromosomes could be combined with doubled haploid breeding to transfer stacked traits more easily to multiple lines and to use minichromosomes for massive scale genome editing.",

For model organisms metabolic models are well established, with many manually curated genome-scale model reconstructions, gene knockout studies and stable-isotope tracing studies. However, for non-model organisms a similar level of knowledge is often lacking. Compartmentation of cellular metabolism in eukaryotic systems also presents significant challenges for quantitative 13C-metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA). Recently, innovative 13C-MFA approaches have been developed based on parallel labeling experiments, the use of multiple isotopic tracers and integrated data analysis, that allow more rigorous validation of pathway models and improved quantification of metabolic fluxes. Applications of these approaches open new research directions in metabolic engineering, biotechnology and medicine.",

     "abstract": "Controlling local concentrations of reactants, intermediates, and enzymes in synthetic pathways is critical for achieving satisfactory productivity of any desired products. An emerging approach to exert control over local concentrations is the use of synthetic biomolecular scaffolds to co-localize key molecules of synthetic pathways. These scaffolds bring the key molecules into close proximity by recruiting pathway enzymes via ligand binding and/or physically sequestrating enzymes and metabolites into isolated compartments. Novel scaffolds made of proteins, nucleic acids, and micro-compartments with increasingly complex architecture have recently been explored and applied to a variety of pathways, with varying degrees of success. Despite these strides, precise assembly of synthetic scaffolds remains a difficult task, particularly in vivo, where interactions both intended and unexpected can lead to unpredictable results. Additionally, because heterologous enzymes often have lowered activities in their new hosts, an ideal scaffold should provide a flexible platform that can adapt to kinetic imbalances in different contexts. In this review, we discuss some of the notable advances in the creation of these synthetic scaffolds and highlight the current challenges in their application.",

A growing body of evidence suggests that autophagy is also activated upon internalization of engineered nanomaterials, most likely as a protective response to what is perceived as foreign or toxic. This review describes the mechanisms of autophagy activation in response to naturally occurring and engineered nanomaterials. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of nanomaterials on the lysosome-autophagy system, with particular emphasis on cellular markers associated with biocompatible and bioadverse outcomes of autophagy activation, such as clearance of toxic material and autophagy-associated cell death.

This review focuses on two practices that increase the likelihood of finding a more advantageous pathway solution: implementing a screen to identify high producers and utilizing modular pathway design to streamline engineering efforts. While screens seek to couple product titer with a high-throughput measurement output, modular design aims to rationally construct pathways to allow parallel optimization of various units.

However, the complexity of cancer genomes commonly makes it difficult to identify specific genes involved in tumour development or therapeutic responsiveness. The generation of mouse models of cancer using transposon-mediated approaches has provided a powerful tool to unveil the role of key genes during cancer development. Here we will discuss how the use of forward and reverse genetic approaches mediated by DNA transposons can support the investigation of cancer pathogenesis, including the identification of cancer promoting mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.",

This paper reviews most important developments in microfluidic 3D culture since 2012. Most efforts were exerted in the field of vasculature, both as a tissue on its own and as part of cancer models. We observe that the focus is shifting from tool building to implementation of specific tissue models. The next big challenge for the field is the full validation of these models and subsequently the implementation of these models in drug development pipelines of the pharmaceutical industry and ultimately in personalized medicine applications.",

     "abstract": "Large-scale production of energetic storage compounds by microalgae is hampered by competition and evolution. Both phenomena result in contamination and arise due to a mismatch between the desired productive microalgal strain and the constructed environment. The prevailing approach to solve this issue involves increasing the survival potential of the desired strain, for example by working in closed systems or at extreme conditions. We advocate adjusting the environment in such a way that lipid production, or any other desired characteristic, gives a competitive advantage. Competition and evolution become a value rather than a threat to processes in which the desired characteristic is ensured by a selective environment. Research and cultivation efforts will benefit from this approach as it harnesses the microalgal diversity in nature.",

In ANP mixotrophic fermentation, the two molecules of CO2 and eight electrons produced from glycolysis are used by the WLP to generate three molecules of acetyl-CoA from glucose, rather than the two molecules that are produced by typical fermentation processes. In this review, we define the bounds of ANP mixotrophy, calculate the potential metabolic advantages, and discuss the viability in a number of host organisms.

The dramatic reduction of field trials in the European Union (EU) coincides with increasing safety demands, decreases in funding, and changes in the European directives. In parallel, opposition from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) has grown, and public acceptance has decreased. The cultivation of events approved by the EU is still allowed in principle, nevertheless, at least in Germany, there is a de facto moratorium on cultivation. In Switzerland, where development was much more hesitant compared to Germany, field trials are now possible, and a protected site has been established by the government. Public acceptance for scientific trials in Switzerland has risen, despite the continued moratorium on the cultivation based on a referendum.",

However, relatively little effort has been put into fermentation process development. The choice for a specific host organism determines to a large extent the process configuration, which in turn influences the environmental impact of the overall process. In the last five years, considerable progress has been achieved towards commercialization of fermentative production of SA.

Interest in these bioparticles has escalated over the years, leading to discoveries regarding their composition, production, and vaccine potential. Given that many steps in vesicle biogenesis are ‘engineerable,’ it is now possible to tailor OMVs for specific applications. Such tailoring involves modifying the OMV-producing bacterium through protein, pathway, or genome engineering in a manner that specifically alters the final OMV product. For example, targeted deletion or upregulation of genes associated with the cell envelope can modulate vesicle production or remodel the composition of vesicle components such as lipopolysaccharide. Likewise, bacteria can be reprogrammed to incorporate heterologously expressed proteins into either the membrane or lumenal compartment of OMVs. We anticipate that further research in the field of OMV engineering will enable continued design and biosynthesis of specialized vesicles for numerous biotechnological purposes ranging from the delivery of vaccines to the deconstruction of cellulosic substrates.",

Incomplete understanding of these complex systems remains an obstacle to progress in biotechnology and metabolic engineering. An established method for obtaining new information on network structure, regulation and dynamics is to study the cellular system following a perturbation such as a genetic knockout. The Keio collection of all viable Escherichia coli single-gene knockouts is facilitating a systematic investigation of the regulation and metabolism of E. coli. Of all omics measurements available, the metabolic flux profile (the fluxome) provides the most direct and relevant representation of the cellular phenotype. Recent advances in 13C-metabolic flux analysis are now permitting highly precise and accurate flux measurements for investigating cellular systems and guiding metabolic engineering efforts.",

This article makes an attempt to put together the information, methods, and technologies that relate to health outcomes from biological, behavioral, and social disciplines. Much of this information was obtained by controlling for the variations of the factors in ‘other’ disciplines. For example, genetic factors were controlled for in identifying the behavioral determinants of health. Looking forward, better understandings of health outcomes may require exploiting the interactions of health determinants that were identified from different disciplines. We propose the concept of ‘systems health’ studies, which take health outcomes as the outputs of a system, where the inputs and their interactions from multiple disciplines are considered.",

Interpreting untargeted metabolomic data, however, remains a challenge and limits the translation of results into biologically relevant conclusions. Here we review emerging technologies that can be applied after untargeted profiling to extend biological interpretation of metabolomic data. These technologies include advances in bioinformatic software that enable identification of isotopes and adducts, comprehensive pathway mapping, deconvolution of MS2 data, and tracking of isotopically labeled compounds. There are also opportunities to gain additional biological insight by complementing the metabolomic analysis of homogenized samples with recently developed technologies for metabolite imaging of intact tissues. To maximize the value of these emerging technologies, a unified workflow is discussed that builds on the traditional untargeted metabolomic pipeline. Particularly when integrated together, the combination of the advances highlighted in this review helps transform lists of masses and fold changes characteristic of untargeted profiling results into structures, absolute concentrations, pathway fluxes, and localization patterns that are typically needed to understand biology.",

Although these approaches generate a large amount of data with a single blood sample, studies have indicated limited success using genetic and metabolomics information alone for identification of disease risk. Clinical assessment of the disposition index (DI), based on the hyperbolic law of glucose tolerance, is a powerful predictor of Type 2 diabetes, but is not easily assessed in the clinical setting.

This knowledge is mainly based on the study of plants and animals, while its relevance for microorganisms is not well understood. The three key groups of micro-predators include protists, predatory bacteria and bacteriophages. They greatly differ in size, in prey specificity, in hunting strategies and in the resulting population dynamics. Yet, their potential to jointly control bacterial populations and reducing biomass in complex environments such as wastewater treatment plants is vast. Here, we present relevant ecological concepts and recent findings on micropredators, and propose that an integrative approach to predation at the microscale should be developed enabling the exploitation of this potential.",

However, the rates at which they naturally degrade petroleum following an oil spill appear to be too slow to prevent oil from reaching the shore and causing environmental damage, as has been documented in the Exxon Valdez and Gulf of Mexico disasters. Unfortunately, there is, at present, no experimentally demonstrated methodology for accelerating the degradation of hydrocarbons in the sea. The rate-limiting factor for petroleum degradation in the sea is availability of nitrogen and phosphorus. Oleophilic fertilizers, such as Inipol EAP 22 and urea-formaldehyde polymers, have stimulated hydrocarbon degradation on shorelines but are less effective in open systems. We suggest uric acid as a potentially useful fertilizer enhancing bioremediation at sea.",

Most likely, the PGR5–PGRL1 pathway corresponds to the cyclic phosphorylation discovered by Arnon and contributes mainly to ΔpH formation in photosynthesis. ATP synthesis utilizes this ΔpH formed by both linear and PSI cyclic electron transport. Furthermore, acidification of the thylakoid lumen downregulates light energy utilization in photosystem II and also electron transport through the cytochrome b6f complex. In the absence of PGR5, chloroplast NDH compensates for the reduced ΔpH formation to some extent. Additionally, proton conductivity is upregulated, probably through ATPase, in pgr5 mutants.

Rapid development of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology of microorganisms shows many advantages to replace the current extraction of these useful high price chemicals from plants. Although few of them were actually applied on a large scale for PNPs production, continuous research on these high-price chemicals and the rapid growing global market of them, show the promising future for the production of these PNPs by microorganisms with a more economic and environmental friendly way. Introduction of novel pathways and optimization of the native cellular processes by metabolic engineering of microorganisms for PNPs production are rapidly expanding its range of cell-factory applications.

     "abstract": "Biomotors have previously been classified into two categories: linear and rotational motors. It has long been popularly believed that viral DNA packaging motors are rotation motors. We have recently found that the DNA-packaging motor of bacteriophage phi29 uses a third mechanism: revolution without rotation. phi29 motor consists of three-coaxial rings of hexameric RNA, a hexameric ATPase, and a dodecameric channel. The motor uses six ATP to revolve one helical turn of dsDNA around the hexameric ring of ATPase gp16. Each dodecameric segment tilts at a 30°-angle and runs anti-parallel to the dsDNA helix to facilitate translation in one direction. The negatively charged phosphate backbone interacts with four positively charged lysine rings, resulting in four steps of transition. This review will discuss how the novel pRNA meets motor requirements for translocation concerning structure, stoichiometry, and thermostability; how pRNA studies have led to the generation of the concept of RNA nanotechnology; and how pRNA is fabricated into nanoparticles to deliver siRNA, miRNA, and ribozymes to cancer and virus-infected cells.",

We point out here that all of these modes of toxicity are relevant and described for conventional pathogenic particles.

But what kind of information should be used to make useful predictions in biology? One important cause of phenotypic variation is of course genetics. However genetic predictions have both practical and fundamental limitations: most genetic influences on a trait are usually unknown, and phenotypic variation is not just due to genetics. A pragmatic alternative is to use intermediate phenotypes such as gene expression and other molecular measurements to make predictions about later trait variation such as disease risk. Intermediate phenotypes are useful because they capture both genetic and non-genetic influences on a system, and can reflect both the current state of a system and its history. Here we discuss examples of both genetic and non-genetic approaches to predicting phenotypic variation. Moreover, we argue that it will be by combining these two sources of information — genetics and intermediate molecular phenotypes — that it will be possible to make accurate predictions about variation in many phenotypic traits, even if we will not always mechanistically understand why this is the case. In particular, we encourage the human genetics community to focus more on combining genetics with intermediate phenotypes when attempting to predict clinically relevant traits such as disease risk.",

Such models should aim to study the microbiome as a community of species whose metabolisms are tightly intertwined with each other and with that of the host, and should be developed with a view towards an integrated, comprehensive, and predictive modeling framework. Here, we review recent work specifically in metabolic modeling of the human microbiome, highlighting both novel methodologies and pressing challenges. We discuss various modeling approaches that lay the foundation for a full-scale predictive model, focusing on models of interactions between microbial species, metagenome-scale models of community-level metabolism, and models of the interaction between the microbiome and the host. Continued development of such models and of their integration into a multi-scale model of the microbiome will lead to a deeper mechanistic understanding of how variation in the microbiome impacts the host, and will promote the discovery of clinically relevant and ecologically relevant insights from the rich trove of data now available.",

However, this structure is likely to be influenced by adaptive genetic change in members of the community, which can occur over a matter of days. Changes in community structure can in turn influence the evolutionary trajectories of species within the community, further altering community structure. Microbial communities provide evidence for this interplay between rapid evolution and community structure. To date, studies are primarily limited to simple in vitro systems, but we suggest similar processes are inevitably operating in both natural and derived communities, which are important for biotechnology.",

While it is clear that such oligosaccharides may have potential applications in infants and adults alike, this potential is limited by the difficulties in manufacturing HMO. Consequently functional alternatives such as galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) are under investigation.

We discuss the differences between enzymes in central versus specialized, or secondary metabolism and highlight unique features of specialized metabolism enzymes participating in the synthesis of natural products. We argue that, for the purpose of metabolic engineering, the catalytic efficiency and selectivity of many enzymes can be improved with the aim of achieving higher rates, yields and product purities.

Recently it has been shown that the macromolecular structure is a good indicator for the growth potential of phytoplankton cells. A functional understanding of natural phytoplankton communities requires a community analysis by means of single particles technologies. However, conventional biochemical methods are not sensitive enough to determine the macromolecular composition of a single cell or cell aggregates. This problem can be resolved by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which delivers results similar to biochemical analysis with a much smaller sample size. The combined approach of flow cytometric analysis with subcommunity sorting and subsequent FTIR-analysis offers new perspectives for the understanding of community functioning and process optimization.",

However, the supply of P from the environment is often limiting to production, including to crops. Thus, large amounts of P are mined annually to produce fertilizer that is applied in support of the ‘Green Revolution.’ However, much of this fertilizer eventually ends up in rivers, lakes and oceans where it causes costly eutrophication. Furthermore, given increasing human population, expanding meat consumption, and proliferating bioenergy pressures, concerns have recently been raised about the long-term geological, economic, and geopolitical viability of mined P for fertilizer production. Together, these issues highlight the non-sustainable nature of current human P use. To achieve P sustainability, farms need to become more efficient in how they use P while society as a whole must develop technologies and practices to recycle P from the food chain. Such large-scale changes will probably require a radical restructuring of the entire food system, highlighting the need for prompt but sustained action.",

The quantity lost is a function of runoff and availability, which is affected by inputs and the ability of the soil to retain P. Losses are exacerbated if surface runoff or drainage occurs soon after P inputs (e.g. fertiliser and/or manure and dung). Strategies to mitigate P losses depend on the farming system. The first step is to maintain a farm P balance (inputs–outputs) close to zero and the agronomic optimum. The next step is to use mitigation strategies in areas that lose the most P, but occupy little of the farm or catchment's area. Focusing on these areas, termed critical source areas, is more cost-effective than farm or catchment-wide strategies. However, the worry is that mitigation strategies may not keep pace with losses due to increasing intensification. Therefore, a proactive approach is needed that identifies areas resilient to P inputs and unlikely to lose P if land use is intensified.",

     "abstract": "Waste streams offer a compelling opportunity to recover phosphorus (P). 15–20% of world demand for phosphate rock could theoretically be satisfied by recovering phosphorus from domestic waste streams alone. For very dilute streams (<10 mgP L−1), including domestic wastewater, it is necessary to concentrate phosphorus in order to make recovery and reuse feasible. This review discusses enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) as a key technology to achieve this. EBPR relies on polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) to take up phosphorus from waste streams, so concentrating phosphorus in biomass. The P-rich biosolids can be either directly applied to land, or solubilized and phosphorus recovered as a mineral product. Direct application is effective, but the product is bulky and carries contaminant risks that need to be managed. Phosphorus release can be achieved using either thermochemical or biochemical methods, while recovery is generally by precipitation as struvite. We conclude that while EBPR technology is mature, the subsequent phosphorus release and recovery technologies need additional development.",

Expanded irrigation for increased phosphorus recovery may be expected as the scarcity and price of phosphorus increases, but providing the necessary treatment, storage and conveyance comes at significant expense. An alternative to taking the wastewater to the plants is instead to take the plants to the wastewater. Algal ponds and macrophyte wetlands are already in widespread use for wastewater treatment and if harvested, would require less than one-tenth of the area to recover phosphorus compared to terrestrial crops/pastures. This area could be further decreased if the phosphorus content of the macrophytes and algae biomass was tripled from 1% to 3% via luxury uptake. While this and many other opportunities for plant based recovery of phosphorus exist, e.g. offshore cultivation, much of this technology development is still in its infancy. Research that enhances our understanding of how to maximise phosphorus uptake and harvest yields; and further add value to the biomass for reuse would see the recovery of phosphorus via plants become an important solution in the future.",

Nat Rev Immunol 2011, 11:865–872). Despite this success and the development of sophisticated new vaccine technologies, there remain multiple infectious diseases including tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS that await an effective prophylactic vaccine. In addition, there have been recent clinical successes among individuals with cancer using vaccine treatment strategies — so-called therapeutic vaccines — that stimulate tumor specific immunity and increase survival (Kantoff PW, Higano CS, Shore ND, Berger ER, Small EJ, Penson DF, Redfern CH, Ferrari AC, Dreicer R, Sims RB, et al.: Sipuleucel-T immunotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer.

KBMA vaccines have two broad applications. First, recombinant KBMA vaccines encoding selected antigens relevant to infectious disease or cancer can be used to elicit a desired immune response. In the second application, KBMA vaccines can be derived from attenuated forms of a targeted pathogen, allowing for the presentation of the entire antigenic repertoire to the immune system, of particular importance when the correlates of protection are unknown.",

These natural inorganic bio-polymers, which can be readily prepared, either by recombinant enzymes (bio-silica and bio-polyP) or chemically (polyP), are promising materials/substances for the amelioration and/or treatment of human bone diseases and dysfunctions. It has been demonstrated that bio-silica causes in vitro a differential effect on the expression of the genes OPG and RANKL, encoding two mediators that control the tuned interaction of the anabolic (osteoblasts) and catabolic (osteoclasts) pathways in human bone cells. Since bio-silica and bio-polyP also induce the expression of the key mediator BMP2 which directs the differentiation of bone-forming progenitor cells to mature osteoblasts and in parallel inhibits the function of osteoclasts, they are promising candidates for treatment of osteoporosis.",

Testing the hypothesis that a large genome size is a prerequisite for versatility in prokaryotes, we found that putatively versatile prokaryotes are phylogenetically and ecologically diverse and indeed include many well known and commercially relevant versatile microorganisms. Despite individual differences in metabolic abilities, a common trait of large-genome prokaryotes appears that they have gained their large genomes as an evolutionary response to nutrient-scarce and/or variable environments. This insight seriously questions the ability of traditional microbiology methods to isolate versatile prokaryotes and casts doubt on the ecological relevance of knowledge based on the study of specialists.",

Estimated global emission rates from these sources can contribute up to 10% of the anthropogenic N2O emissions. Particularly at the level of a treatment plant, the N2O impact can be very significant and reach up to 80% of the operational CO2 footprint. Imperfect nitritation by an imbalance in the two-step nitritation metabolism of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria is considered as the main contributor to N2O production with hydroxylamine and particularly nitrite as key precursors. Monitoring of these compounds is warranted to understand and abate N2O emissions. Mitigation strategies should also comprise optimizations of the process parameters as well as bio-augmentative approaches empowered to restore the functional capacity and to deal with unwanted accumulation of intermediates.

Lack of early-life exposure to certain microbes, or shifts in the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome have been linked to the development and progression of several intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases, including childhood asthma development and inflammatory bowel disease. Modulating microbial exposure through probiotic supplementation represents a long-held strategy towards ameliorating disease via intestinal microbial community restructuring.

Two approaches have been field trialled that control a wide range of nematodes by either limiting use of their dietary protein uptake from the crop or by preventing root invasion without a direct lethality. In addition, RNA interference increasingly in tandem with genomic studies is providing a range of potential resistance traits that involve no novel protein production. Transgenic resistance can be delivered by tissue specific promoters to just root tissues where most economic nematodes invade and feed rather than the harvested yield. High efficacy and durability can be provided by stacking nematode resistance traits including any that natural resistance provides.

     "abstract": "Marine biotechnology is the industrial, medical or environmental application of biological resources from the sea. Since the marine environment is the most biologically and chemically diverse habitat on the planet, marine biotechnology has, in recent years delivered a growing number of major therapeutic products, industrial and environmental applications and analytical tools. These range from the use of a snail toxin to develop a pain control drug, metabolites from a sea squirt to develop an anti-cancer therapeutic, and marine enzymes to remove bacterial biofilms. In addition, well known and broadly used analytical techniques are derived from marine molecules or enzymes, including green fluorescence protein gene tagging methods and heat resistant polymerases used in the polymerase chain reaction. Advances in bacterial identification, metabolic profiling and physical handling of cells are being revolutionised by techniques such as mass spectrometric analysis of bacterial proteins. Advances in instrumentation and a combination of these physical advances with progress in proteomics and bioinformatics are accelerating our ability to harness biology for commercial gain. Single cell Raman spectroscopy and microfluidics are two emerging techniques which are also discussed elsewhere in this issue. In this review, we provide a brief survey and update of the most powerful and rapidly growing analytical techniques as used in marine biotechnology, together with some promising examples of less well known earlier stage methods which may make a bigger impact in the future.",

Several polymeric drugs as well as polymer–protein conjugates have been in the market since the 90s, but although polymer–drug conjugates are already in clinical trials they still need to reach this final goal. There are four main convergent strategies to move this platform technology further. First, exploitation of new molecular targets in cancer therapy and design of polymer–drug conjugates as treatments for other diseases. Second, the development of combination therapy. Third, attempts to improve polymer chemistry, including the use of new well-defined architectures and the optimization of the advanced characterization techniques essential to transform a promising conjugate into a candidate for clinical evaluation. Finally, increased understanding of polymer conjugate features that govern clinical risk–benefit is leading to an appreciation of clinical biomarkers that will open new possibilities for personalized therapy.",

These pores are used to transfer nutrients and oxygen and remove wastes produced from the cells. The lack of oxygen and nutrient supply impedes the cell migration more than 500 μm from the surface. The physical properties of scaffolds such as porosity and pore interconnectivity can improve mass transfer and have a great impact on the cell adhesion and penetration into the scaffolds to form a new tissue. Various techniques such as electrospinning, freeze-drying, and solvent casting/salt leaching have been used to create porosity in scaffolds.

Future studies should acknowledge that current evidence indicates low toxicity of nC60 and refrain from citing articles that attribute toxicity in fish to nC60 based on methods shown to be compromised by experimental artifacts. Despite low toxicity of nC60 in fish, an emerging environmental issue is that nC60 can affect environmental fate, transport, and bioavailability of co-contaminants in aquatic environments in a similar manner to that observed for other anthropogenic particulates (e.g., microplastics).",

Respiration metabolism is energetically favorable and leads to less oxidative and acid stress during growth. As a consequence, the growth and survival of several LAB can be dramatically improved under respiration-permissive conditions. Respiration metabolism already has industrial applications for the production of dairy starter cultures. In view of the growth and survival advantages conferred by respiration, and the availability of heme and menaquinones in natural environments, we recommend that respiration be accepted as a part of the natural lifestyle of numerous LAB.",

While these so-called natural products have been targets for plant metabolic engineering attempts for many years, the immense value of manipulating the interface between committed steps in secondary metabolism pathways and those in primary metabolism pathways has only recently emerged. In this review we discuss a few of the major issues that should be taken into consideration in attempts to engineer the primary to secondary metabolism interface. The availability of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur resources will have a major impact on the production of specific classes of primary metabolites (PMs) and consequently on the levels and composition of SMs derived from these PMs. Recent studies have shown that transcription factors associated with the synthesis of a given class of SMs coactivate the expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes associated with primary pathways that supply precursors to these SMs. In addition, metabolic engineering approaches, which alter post-transcriptional feedback and feedforward regulatory mechanisms of the primary–secondary metabolism interface, have been highly fruitful in Taylormade enhancements of the content of specific beneficial SMs. Lastly, the evolution of pathways of secondary metabolism from pathways of primary metabolism highlights the need to consider cases in which common enzymatic reactions and pathways take place between the two. Taken together, the available information indicates a supercoordinated gene expression networks connecting primary and secondary metabolism in plants, which should be taken into consideration in future attempts to metabolically engineer the various classes of plant SMs.",

This review describes the application of these methods to the characterization of the kinetics of interaction between biomolecules. A large number of single-molecule assays have been developed that visualize association and dissociation kinetics in vitro by fluorescently labeling binding partners and observing their interactions over time. Even though recent progress has been significant, there are certain limitations to this approach. To allow the observation of individual, fluorescently labeled molecules requires low, nanomolar concentrations. I will discuss how such concentration requirements in single-molecule experiments limit their applicability to investigate intermolecular interactions and how recent technical advances deal with this issue.",

These include interactions between proteins that form a functional complex, a protein modifying another protein in a transient interaction, a transcription factor that binds a specific DNA locus triggering a change in chromatin or transcription, and so on. Characterization of these interactions in terms of timing, context, and function is crucial for understanding how cells carry out basic biological processes. The recent years have led to the introduction of many assays for probing these interactions in a systematic and large-scale manner. However, there is a large gap between assay results and understanding of biological systems. The challenge for computational methods is to bridge this gap by combining results of different assays and introducing statistical methodologies.

These scenarios drastically increase the complexity of the task, which is only partly dealt by existing approaches that rely on rigorous simulations of label propagation through metabolic networks and require multiple labeling experiments or a priori information on pathway inactivity to simplify the problem. Albeit qualitative and largely driven by human interpretation, statistical analysis of measured 13C-patterns remains the exclusive alternative to comprehensively handle such complex systems.

Many efforts have been undertaken these past years to identify cellular barriers that have to be passed for this issue. Here, we summarize the current status of knowledge on the uptake mechanism of DNA nanoparticles made with polymers and liposomes, their endosomal escape, cytosolic diffusion, and nuclear import of pDNA. Studies reported these past years regarding pDNA nanoparticles endocytosis indicated that there is no clear evident relationship between the ways of entry and the transfection efficiency. By contrast, the sequestration of pDNA in intracellular vesicles and the low number of pDNA close to the nuclear envelop are identified as the major intracellular barriers. So, intensive investigations to increase the cytosolic delivery of pDNA and its migration toward nuclear pores make sense to bring the transfection efficiency closer to that of viruses.",

The fuel for these systems is organic matter resulting from oceanic primary productivity. Models suggest that MFCs may operate for decades on endogenous organic carbon. In light of their capacity to generate power in natural milieus by tapping into biogeochemical cycles, MFCs may one day provide an efficient means of generating power (or high value biofuels) directly from marine productivity.",

Therefore, most recent research has been performed to generate sufficient electric current from sunlight with either electrocatalysts or heterotrophic bacteria on the anode to convert photosynthetic products indirectly. The most promising photoMFCs to date are electrocatalytic bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) that convert hydrogen from photosynthesis and sediment-based BESs that can convert excreted organics from cyanobacteria or plants. In addition, illumination on the cathode may provide either oxygen for an electrocatalytic reduction reaction or a promising anoxygenic biocathode.",

     "abstract": "Single cells represent the minimal functional unit of life. A major goal of biology is to understand the mechanisms operating in this minimal unit. Nowadays, analysis of the single cell can be performed at unprecedented resolution using new lab-on-a-chip devices and advanced analytical methods. While cell handling and cultivation devices can be classified into finite volume reactors and flow systems, the analytical approaches differ in respect to invasive (i.e. chemical) and noninvasive (i.e. biological/living cell) analysis. Using these new and exciting technologies cell-to-cell differences, originating from regulatory circuits and distinct microenvironments, can now be explored. For example, it could be shown that the rates of transcription and translation are stochastic. Chemical and biological single cell analyses provide an unprecedented access to the understanding of cell-to-cell differences and basic biological concepts.",

Several methods are available for the evaluation and understanding of the differences: Biochemical methods to measure metabolites concentration and enzyme activity, mathematical methods to analyze metabolic fluxes through the various pathways, proteomic methods to identify expressed proteins, and genomic methods to detect and measure gene expression. A combination of the various methods is required to obtain a comprehensive understanding of metabolic activities. The genomic methods provide substantial amount information on global gene expression but do not always reflect the actual activity of the individual components. The review focuses on the different methodologies and their use, as well as historical overview of the evaluation of the differences between Escherichia coli K and E. coli B.",

     "abstract": "Targeted metabolomics, aimed at the study of metabolic reaction networks and their regulation in vivo, is a rapidly emerging field in systems biology. Obtaining proper quantitative snapshots of the microbial metabolome requires fast sampling, immediate quenching of enzymatic activity, separation of exometabolome and endometabolome, complete metabolite extraction from the cells, and reliable high-throughput analysis methods. This review addresses the current state of the art of rapid sampling and quenching for microbial metabolomics. Several robust and reliable rapid sampling devices have been developed. Various quenching and separation procedures have been proposed and applied, but with respect to the reliability of the different methods the literature is contradictory. To date a reliable universal method applicable to different microbial species is still lacking.",

     "abstract": "Metabolomics, as an essential part of genomics studies, intends holistic understanding of metabolic networks through simultaneous analysis of a myriad of both known and unknown metabolites occurring in living organisms. The initial stage of metabolomics was designed for the reproducible analyses of known metabolites based on their comparison to available authentic compounds. Such metabolomics platforms were mostly based on mass spectrometry (MS) technologies enabled by a combination of different ionization methods together with a variety of separation steps including LC, GC, and CE. Among these, Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance MS (FT-ICR/MS) is distinguished from other MS technologies by its ultrahigh resolution power in mass to charge ratio (m/z). The potential of FT-ICR/MS as a distinctive metabolomics tool has been demonstrated in nontargeted metabolic profiling and functional characterization of novel genes. Here, we discuss both the advantages and difficulties encountered in the FT-ICR/MS metabolomics studies.",

In this review, we will introduce recent progress made in the variety and properties of biosensors, and how biosensors are used for the measurement of metabolite and ion in live cells. The emerging field of applications, such as parallel imaging of two separate molecules, high-resolution transport studies and high-throughput screening using biosensors, will be discussed.",

Metabolic flux analysis evolved as a powerful means for systems biology to quantitatively analyze intracellular flux distributions. With the integration of data from tracer experiments, the formerly descriptive methodology has turned into a versatile tool to validate assumptions on genome-derived flux networks. Powerful modeling frameworks balancing ‘isotopomers’, ‘cumomers’, or ‘elementary modeling units’ have reduced computational effort and introduced rigorous statistical quality measures. The advent of metabolomics, stimulus response experiments, and highly sensitive mass spectrometry techniques for mass isotopomer analysis has extended the reach of metabolic flux analysis from steady-state to highly dynamic conditions. With the integration of regulatory circuits and more ‘omics’ data into mechanistic flux models, the simulation-based prediction of cellular responses to environmental and network perturbations becomes possible — an in silico cell.",

This review describes recent advances, the challenges as well as applications of metabolic flux analysis comprising fungi, mammalian cells and plants. While MFA is widely established and applied in microorganisms, it remains still a challenge to adapt these methods to eukaryotic cell systems having a higher complexity particularly concerning compartmentation or media composition. In fungi MFA was used in the past few years to analyze a variety of conditions and factors and their effects on cellular metabolism. In mammalian cells MFA was applied mainly in cell culture technology and in medical and toxicological research. 13C metabolic studies on native whole plants are additionally challenging by the fact that CO2 is usually the only carbon source.",

     "abstract": "In the wake of numerous sequenced genomes becoming available, computational methods for the reconstruction of metabolic networks have received considerable attention. Here, we review recent methods and software tools useful along the reconstruction workflow, from sequence annotation and network assembly to model verification and testing against experimental data. Reconstruction methods can be divided into three categories, depending on the magnitude of network context which is taken into account in the process of assembling the metabolic model: First, each enzyme may be predicted independently by annotation transfer or machine learning methods. Second, the presence of a metabolic pathway may be detected from genome and experimental evidence, often utilizing a reference pathway database. Third, the method may attempt to directly reconstruct a consistent metabolic network without relying on predefined reference pathways. Regardless of the chosen context, all methods strive to reconstruct genome-scale metabolic reconstructions. Currently a gap exists between software platforms dedicated to genome annotation and computational tools for automatically repairing network inconsistencies and validating against measurement data. We argue that to accelerate the reconstruction efforts, computational tools need to be developed that bridge the phases of the reconstruction workflow. In particular, the goal of finding consistent metabolic models suitable for computational analysis should be taken into account already in the beginning phases of reconstruction.",

As increasing amounts of multidimensional high-throughput data become available, biological networks have also been upgraded, allowing more accurate understanding of whole cellular characteristics. The network size is constantly expanding as larger volume of information and omics data are further integrated into the biological networks previously built upon a single type of data. Such effort more recently led to the modeling of human metabolic network and prediction of its tissue-specific metabolism, reconstruction of consensus yeast metabolic network, and simulation of mutual interactions among multiple microorganisms. It is expected that this trend will continue, the outcomes of which will allow development of more sophisticated networks integrating diverse omics data, and enhance our understanding of biological systems.",

Yet, their applications in bacteria, especially in the multiparametric mode, remain limited. We argue that FC technologies have the potential to greatly accelerate the analysis and development of microbial complex phenotypes through applications of metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, and evolutionary engineering. We demonstrate the importance of FC for elucidating population heterogeneity because of developmental processes or epigenetic regulation. FC can be engaged for both synthetic and analytical applications of complex phenotypes within a single species, multispecies, and microbial-library populations. Examples include methods to identify developmental microbial stages associated with productive metabolic phenotypes, select desirable promoters from a single species or metagenomic libraries, and to screen designer riboswitches for synthetic-biology applications.",

Since inefficient subpopulations have significant impact on the productivity of industrial cultures, cellular heterogeneity needs to be detected and quantified by using high speed detection tools like flow cytometry. Possible origins of population heterogeneity, sophisticated fluorescent techniques for detection of individual cell states, and cutting-edge Omics-technologies for extended information beyond the resolution of fluorescent labelling are highlighted.",
