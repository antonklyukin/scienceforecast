     "abstract": "1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) is an industrial chemical with a broad range of applications, such as the production of alkyd and unsaturated polyester resins. It is currently produced as a racemic mixture from nonrenewable petroleum-based feedstocks. We have reported a novel artificial pathway for the biosynthesis of 1,2-PDO via lactic acid isomers as the intermediates. The pathway circumvents the cytotoxicity issue caused by methylglyoxal intermediate in the naturally existing pathway. Successful E. coli bioconversion of lactic acid to 1,2-PDO was shown in previous report. Here, we demonstrated the engineering of E. coli host strains for the de novo biosynthesis of 1,2-PDO through this pathway. Under fermenter-controlled conditions, the R-1,2-PDO was produced at 17.3 g/L with a molar yield of 42.2% from glucose, while the S-isomer was produced at 9.3 g/L with a molar yield of 23.2%. The optical purities of the two isomers were 97.5% ee (R) and 99.3% ee (S), respectively. To the best of our knowledge, these are the highest titers of 1,2-PDO biosynthesized by either natural producer or engineered microbial strains that are published in peer-reviewed journals.",

     "abstract": "In metabolic engineering, most available pathway engineering strategies aim to control enzyme expression by making changes at the transcriptional level with an underlying assumption that translation and functional expression follow suit. In this work, we engineer expression of a key reaction step in medium chain ester biosynthesis that does not follow this common assumption. The native Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol acyltransferses Eeb1 and Eht1 condense acyl-CoAs with ethanol to produce the corresponding ester, a reaction that is rate limiting in engineering ester biosynthesis pathways. By changing the N- and C-termini of Eeb1 to those of Eht1, Eeb1 localization is changed from the mitochondria to lipid droplets. The change has no significant effect on transcription, but increases protein expression by 23-fold thus enabling a 3-fold increase in enzyme activity. This system demonstrates one example of the impact of protein trafficking on functional pathway expression, and will guide future metabolic engineering of ester biosynthesis and, potentially, other pathways with critical membrane-bound enzymes.",

     "abstract": "Three atypical regulatory genes, hmtABD have been discovered within the himastatin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in Streptomyces hygroscopicus ATCC 53653 and the roles of their products have been identified. HmtA and HmtD do not show any structurally distinct features characteristic of regulatory function yet were shown to play important repressive and stimulatory roles, respectively, related to himastatin biosynthesis. HmtB encodes a conserved acetylglutamate kinase; new member of this family serves as repressor of secondary metabolism. Through repressive networks engineering, the limiting functions of HmtA and HmtB along with the activating functions of HmtD in the himastatin BGC have been identified for the first time by gene activation, qPCR, RT-PCR and HPLC studies of selected mutant strains; two of these mutant strains (ΔhmtA and ΔhmtB) produced himastatin in titers (19.02 ± 1.2 μg/mL, 9.9 folds and 30.40 ± 0.83 μg/mL, 15.8 folds) far exceeding those of the wild-type (WT) producer. Overall, this work provides significant insight into secondary metabolic regulatory mechanisms in Streptomyces.

     "abstract": "Spatial clustering of enzymes has proven an elegant approach to optimize metabolite transfer between enzymes in synthetic metabolic pathways. Among the multiple methods used to promote colocalisation, enzyme fusion is probably the simplest. Inspired by natural systems, we have explored the metabolic consequences of spatial reorganizations of the catalytic domains of Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous carotenoid enzymes produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Synthetic genes encoding bidomain enzymes composed of CrtI and CrtB domains from the natural CrtYB fusion were connected in the two possible orientations, using natural and synthetic linkers. A tridomain enzyme (CrtB, CrtI, CrtY) harboring the full β-carotene producing pathway was also constructed. Our results demonstrate that domain order and linker properties considerably impact both the expression and/or stability of the constructed proteins and the functionality of the catalytic domains, all concurring to either diminish or boost specific enzymatic steps of the metabolic pathway. Remarkably, the yield of β-carotene production doubled with the tridomain fusion while precursor accumulation decreased, leading to an improvement of the pathway efficiency, when compared to the natural system. Our data strengthen the idea that fusion of enzymatic domains is an appropriate technique not only to achieve spatial confinement and enhance the metabolic flux but also to produce molecules not easily attainable with natural enzymatic configurations, even with membrane bound enzymes.",

In this paper we present a novel method to generate kinetic models of such cultures, rendering complex metabolic networks in a poly-pathway kinetic model. The model is based on subsets of elementary flux modes (EFMs) to generate macro-reactions. Thanks to our column generation-based optimization algorithm, the experimental data are used to identify the EFMs, which are relevant to the data. Here the systematic enumeration of all the EFMs is eliminated and a network including a large number of reactions can be considered. In particular, the poly-pathway model can simulate multiple metabolic behaviors in response to changes in the culture conditions.We apply the method to a network of 126 metabolic reactions describing cultures of antibody-producing Chinese hamster ovary cells, and generate a poly-pathway model that simulates multiple experimental conditions obtained in response to variations in amino acid availability. A good fit between simulated and experimental data is obtained, rendering the variations in the growth, product, and metabolite uptake/secretion rates. The intracellular reaction fluxes simulated by the model are explored, linking variations in metabolic behavior to adaptations of the intracellular metabolism.",

     "abstract": "Biological production of chemicals is an attractive alternative to petrochemical-based production, due to advantages in environmental impact and the spectrum of feasible targets. However, engineering microbial strains to overproduce a compound of interest can be a long, costly and painstaking process. If production can be coupled to cell growth it is possible to use adaptive laboratory evolution to increase the production rate. Strategies for coupling production to growth, however, are often not trivial to find. Here we present OptCouple, a constraint-based modeling algorithm to simultaneously identify combinations of gene knockouts, insertions and medium supplements that lead to growth-coupled production of a target compound. We validated the algorithm by showing that it can find novel strategies that are growth-coupled in silico for a compound that has not been coupled to growth previously, as well as reproduce known growth-coupled strain designs for two different target compounds. Furthermore, we used OptCouple to construct an alternative design with potential for higher production.

The ethanologenic bacterium Zymomonas mobilis performs rapid and efficient anaerobic ethanol fermentation, yet its respiratory NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh)-deficient strain (ndh-) is known to produce ethanol with high yield also under oxic conditions. Compared to the wild type, it has a lower rate of oxygen consumption, and an increased expression of the respiratory lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh). Here we present a quantitative study of the product spectrum and carbon balance for aerobically growing ndh-. Ldh-deficient and Ldh-overexpressing ndh- strains were constructed and used to examine the putative role of the respiratory lactate bypass for aerobic growth and production. We show that aerobically growing ndh- strains perform fermentative metabolism with a near-maximum ethanol yield, irrespective of their Ldh expression background. Yet, Ldh activity strongly affects the aerobic product spectrum in glucose-consuming non-growing cells. Also, Ldh-deficiency hampers growth at elevated temperature (42 °C) and delays the restart of growth after 10–15 h of aerobic starvation.",

Filtering for high confidence in silico designs is critical because in vivo construction and testing of strains is expensive and time consuming. As such, a workflow was devised to analyze the robustness of growth-coupled production when considering the biosynthetic costs of the proteome and variability in enzyme kinetic parameters using a genome-scale model of metabolism and gene expression (ME-model). A collection of 2632 unfiltered knockout designs in Escherichia coli was evaluated by the workflow. A ME-model was used in the workflow to test the designs’ growth-coupled production in addition to a less complex genome-scale metabolic model (M-model). The workflow identified 634 M-model growth-coupled designs which met the filtering criteria and 42 robust designs, which met growth-coupled production criteria using both M and ME-models. Knockouts were found to follow a pattern of controlling intermediate metabolite consumption such as pyruvate consumption and high flux subsystems such as glycolysis. Kinetic parameter sampling using the ME-model revealed how enzyme efficiency and pathway tradeoffs can affect growth-coupled production phenotypes.",

     "publication date": "12-2018",
     "abstract": "Mandelic acid is an important aromatic fine chemical and is currently mainly produced via chemical synthesis. Recently, mandelic acid production was achieved by microbial fermentations using engineered Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing heterologous hydroxymandelate synthases (hmaS). The best-performing strains carried a deletion of the gene encoding the first enzyme of the tyrosine biosynthetic pathway and therefore were auxotrophic for tyrosine. This was necessary to avoid formation of the competing intermediate hydroxyphenylpyruvate, the preferred substrate for HmaS, which would have resulted in the predominant production of hydroxymandelic acid. However, feeding tyrosine to the medium would increase fermentation costs. In order to engineer a tyrosine prototrophic mandelic acid-producing S. cerevisiae strain, we tested three strategies: (1) rational engineering of the HmaS active site for reduced binding of hydroxyphenylpyruvate, (2) compartmentalization of the mandelic acid biosynthesis pathway by relocating HmaS together with the two upstream enzymes chorismate mutase Aro7 and prephenate dehydratase Pha2 into mitochondria or peroxisomes, and (3) utilizing a feedback-resistant version of the bifunctional E. coli enzyme PheA (PheAfbr) in an aro7 deletion strain. PheA has both chorismate mutase and prephenate dehydratase activity. Whereas the enzyme engineering approaches were only successful in respect to reducing the preference of HmaS for hydroxyphenylpyruvate but not in increasing mandelic acid titers, we could show that strategies (2) and (3) significantly reduced hydroxymandelic acid production in favor of increased mandelic acid production, without causing tyrosine auxotrophy. Using the bifunctional enzyme PheAfbr turned out to be the most promising strategy, and mandelic acid production could be increased 12-fold, yielding titers up to 120 mg/L. Moreover, our results indicate that utilizing PheAfbr also shows promise for other industrial applications with S. cerevisiae that depend on a strong flux into the phenylalanine biosynthetic pathway.",

     "abstract": "For improving the microbial production of fuels and chemicals, gene knock-outs and overexpression are routinely applied to intensify the carbon flow from substrate to product. However, their possibilities in dynamic control of the flux between the biomass and product synthesis are limited, whereas dynamic metabolic switches can be used for optimizing the distribution of carbon and resources. The production of single cell oils is especially challenging, as the synthesis is strictly regulated, competes directly with biomass, and requires defined conditions, such as nitrogen limitation. Here, we engineered a metabolic switch for redirecting carbon flow from biomass to wax ester production in Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 using acetate as a carbon source. Isocitrate lyase, an essential enzyme for growth on acetate, was expressed under an arabinose inducible promoter. The autonomous downregulation of the expression is based on the gradual oxidation of the arabinose inducer by a glucose dehydrogenase gcd. The depletion of the inducer, occurring simultaneously to acetate consumption, switches the cells from a biomass mode to a lipid synthesis mode, enabling the efficient channelling of carbon to wax esters in a simple batch culture. In the engineered strain, the yield and titer of wax esters were improved by 3.8 and 3.1 folds, respectively, over the control strain. In addition, the engineered strain accumulated wax esters 19% of cell dry weight, being the highest reported among microbes. The study provides important insights into the dynamic engineering of the biomass-dependent synthesis pathways for the improved production of biocompounds from low-cost and sustainable substrates.",

     "abstract": "The triterpenoid (+)-ambrein is a natural precursor for (-)-ambrox, which constitutes one of the most sought-after fragrances and fixatives for the perfume industry. (+)-Ambrein is a major component of ambergris, an intestinal excretion of sperm whales that is found only serendipitously. Thus, the demand for (-)-ambrox is currently mainly met by chemical synthesis. A recent study described for the first time the applicability of an enzyme cascade consisting of two terpene cyclases, namely squalene-hopene cyclase from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius (AaSHC D377C) and tetraprenyl-β-curcumene cyclase from Bacillus megaterium (BmeTC) for in vitro (+)-ambrein production starting from squalene. Yeasts, such as Pichia pastoris, are natural producers of squalene and have already been shown in the past to be excellent hosts for the biosynthesis of hydrophobic compounds such as terpenoids. By targeting a central enzyme in the sterol biosynthesis pathway, squalene epoxidase Erg1, intracellular squalene levels in P. pastoris could be strongly enhanced. Heterologous expression of AaSHC D377C and BmeTC and, particularly, development of suitable methods to analyze all products of the engineered strain provided conclusive evidence of whole-cell (+)-ambrein production. Engineering of BmeTC led to a remarkable one-enzyme system that was by far superior to the cascade, thereby increasing (+)-ambrein levels approximately 7-fold in shake flask cultivation. Finally, upscaling to 5 L bioreactor yielded more than 100 mg L−1 of (+)-ambrein, demonstrating that metabolically engineered yeast P. pastoris represents a valuable, whole-cell system for high-level production of (+)-ambrein.",

In this study, we report a direct microbial biosynthesis of terminal alkenes from fermentable sugars by harnessing a P450 fatty acid (FA) decarboxylase from Macrococcus caseolyticus (OleTMC). We first characterized OleTMC and demonstrated its in vitro H2O2-independent activities towards linear C10:0-C18:0 FAs, with higher activity for C16:0-C18:0 FAs. Next, we engineered a de novo alkene biosynthesis pathway, consisting of OleTMC and an engineered E. coli thioesterase (TesA) with compatible substrate specificities, and introduced this pathway into E. coli for terminal alkene biosynthesis from glucose. The recombinant E. coli EcNN101 produced a total of 17.78 ± 0.63 mg/L odd-chain terminal alkenes, comprising of 0.9% ± 0.5% C11 alkene, 12.7% ± 2.2% C13 alkene, 82.7% ± 1.7% C15 alkene, and 3.7% ± 0.8% C17 alkene, and a yield of 0.87 ± 0.03 (mg/g) on glucose.

Here we applied stoichiometric metabolic modeling based on physiological and process data to evaluate different process variants for the conversion of C1 carbon compounds to the industrial relevant platform chemical succinic acid. We computationally analyzed the performance of cyanobacteria, acetogens, methylotrophs, and synthetic CO2 fixation pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in terms of production rates, product yields, and the optimization potential. This analysis provided insight into the economic feasibility and allowed to estimate the future industrial applicability by estimating overall production costs. With reported, or estimated data of engineered or wild type strains, none of the simulated microbial succinate production processes showed a performance allowing competitive production. The main limiting factors were identified as gas and photon transfer and metabolic activities whereas metabolic network structure was not restricting. In simulations with optimized parameters most process alternatives reached economically interesting values, hence, represent promising alternatives to sugar-based fermentations.",

     "abstract": "Caldicellulosiruptor bescii is an extremely thermophilic cellulolytic bacterium with great potential for consolidated bioprocessing of renewable plant biomass. Since it does not natively produce ethanol, metabolic engineering is required to create strains with this capability. Previous efforts involved the heterologous expression of the gene encoding a bifunctional alcohol dehydrogenase, AdhE, which uses NADH as the electron donor to reduce acetyl-CoA to ethanol. Acetyl-CoA produced from sugar oxidation also generates reduced ferredoxin but there is no known pathway for the transfer of electrons from reduced ferredoxin to NAD in C. bescii. Herein, we engineered a strain of C. bescii using a more stable genetic background than previously reported and heterologously-expressed adhE from Clostridium thermocellum (which grows optimally (Topt) at 60 °C) with and without co-expression of the membrane-bound Rnf complex from Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514 (Topt 60 °C). Rnf is an energy-conserving, reduced ferredoxin NAD oxidoreductase encoded by six genes (rnfCDGEAB). It was produced in a catalytically active form in C. bescii that utilized the largest DNA construct to be expressed in this organism. The new genetic lineage containing AdhE resulted in increased ethanol production compared to previous reports. Ethanol production was further enhanced by the presence of Rnf, which also resulted in decreased production of pyruvate, acetoin and an uncharacterized compound as unwanted side-products. Using crystalline cellulose as the growth substrate for the Rnf-containing strain, 75 mM (3.5 g/L) ethanol was produced at 60 °C, which is 5-fold higher than that reported previously. This underlines the importance of redox balancing and paves the way for achieving even higher ethanol titers in C. bescii.",

     "abstract": "Production of propionic acid by fermentation of propionibacteria has gained increasing attention in the past few years. However, biomanufacturing of propionic acid cannot compete with the current oxo-petrochemical synthesis process due to its well-established infrastructure, low oil prices and the high downstream purification costs of microbial production. Strain improvement to increase propionic acid yield is the best alternative to reduce downstream purification costs. The recent generation of genome-scale models for a number of Propionibacterium species facilitates the rational design of metabolic engineering strategies and provides a new opportunity to explore the metabolic potential of the Wood-Werkman cycle. Previous strategies for strain improvement have individually targeted acid tolerance, rate of propionate production or minimisation of by-products. Here we used the P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii and the pan-Propionibacterium genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to simultaneously target these combined issues. This was achieved by focussing on strategies which yield higher energies and directly suppress acetate formation. Using P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii, two strategies were assessed. The first tested the ability to manipulate the redox balance to favour propionate production by over-expressing the first two enzymes of the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP), Zwf (glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase) and Pgl (6-phosphogluconolactonase). Results showed a 4-fold increase in propionate to acetate ratio during the exponential growth phase. Secondly, the ability to enhance the energy yield from propionate production by over-expressing an ATP-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and sodium-pumping methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MMD) was tested, which extended the exponential growth phase. Together, these strategies demonstrate that in silico design strategies are predictive and can be used to reduce by-product formation in Propionibacterium. We also describe the benefit of carbon dioxide to propionibacteria growth, substrate conversion and propionate yield.",

By optimizing metabolic flux and fermentation parameters, the engineered strains yielded 449 mg/L of total terpene, including 406 mg/L sesquiterpene with 100 mg/L caryophyllene and 10 mg/L caryolan-1-ol. Furthermore, a marine microalgae hydrolysate was used as the sole carbon source for the production of caryophyllene and other terpene compounds. Under the optimal fermentation conditions, 360 mg/L of total terpene, 322 mg/L of sesquiterpene, and 75 mg/L caryophyllene were obtained from the pretreated algae hydrolysates. The highest yields achieved on the biomass basis were 48 mg total terpene/g algae and 10 mg caryophyllene/g algae and the caryophyllene yield is approximately ten times higher than that from plant tissues by solvent extraction. The study provides a sustainable alternative for production of caryophyllene and its alcohol from microalgae biomass as potential candidates for next generation aviation fuels.",

Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the favored microbial cell factory for industrial production of biochemicals, it does not produce large amounts of lipids and TAGs comprise only ~1% of its cell dry weight. Here, we engineered S. cerevisiae to reorient its metabolism for overproduction of TAGs, by regulating lipid droplet associated-proteins involved in TAG synthesis and hydrolysis. We implemented a push-and-pull strategy by overexpressing genes encoding a deregulated acetyl-CoA carboxylase, ACC1S659A/S1157A(ACC1**), as well as the last two steps of TAG formation: phosphatidic phosphatase (PAH1) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGA1), ultimately leading to 129 mg∙gCDW−1 of TAGs. Disruption of TAG lipase genes TGL3, TGL4, TGL5 and sterol acyltransferase gene ARE1 increased the TAG content to 218 mg∙gCDW−1. Further disruption of the beta-oxidation by deletion of POX1, as well as glycerol-3-phosphate utilization through deletion of GUT2, did not affect TAGs levels. Finally, disruption of the peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA transporter PXA1 led to accumulation of 254 mg∙gCDW−1. The TAG levels achieved here are the highest titer reported in S. cerevisiae, reaching 27.4% of the maximum theoretical yield in minimal medium with 2% glucose. This work shows the potential of using an industrially established and robust yeast species for high level lipid production.",

However, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in their aerobic fermentation process often limits their PUFA titer. Yet, the specific mechanisms of ROS involvement in the crosstalk between oxidative stress and intracellular lipid synthesis remain poorly described. Metabolic engineering to improve the PUFA yield in thraustochytrids without compromising growth is an important aspect of economic feasibility. To fill this gap, we overexpressed the antioxidative gene superoxide dismutase (SOD1) by integrating it into the genome of thraustochytrid Schizochytrium sp. PKU#Mn4 using a novel genetic transformation system. This study reports the ROS alleviation, enhanced PUFA production and transcriptome changes resulting from the SOD1 overexpression. SOD1 activity in the recombinant improved by 5.2–71.6% along with 7.8–38.5% decline in ROS during the fermentation process. Interestingly, the total antioxidant capacity in the recombinant remained higher than wild-type and above zero in the entire process. Although lipid profile was similar to that of wild-type, the concentrations of major fatty acids in the recombinant were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher. The PUFA titer increased up to 1232 ± 41 mg/L, which was 32.9% higher (p ≤ 0.001) than the wild type. Transcriptome analysis revealed strong downregulation of genes potentially involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids in peroxisome and upregulation of genes catalyzing lipid biosynthesis. Our results enrich the knowledge on stress-induced PUFA biosynthesis and the putative role of ROS in the regulation of lipid metabolism in oleaginous thraustochytrids.

Strong flocculation can improve the inhibitor tolerance and fermentation performance of yeast cells in second generation bioethanol production. The strength of flocculation increases with the size of the flocculation protein and is strain dependent. However, the large number of internal repeats in the sequence of FLO1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c makes it difficult to recombinantly express the gene to its full length. In the search for novel flocculation genes resulting in strong flocculation, we discovered a DNA sequence, FLONF, that gives NewFlo phenotype flocculation in S. cerevisiae CEN.PK 113-7D. The nucleotide sequence of the internal repeats of FLONF differed from those of FLO1. We hypothesized that a chimaeric flocculation gene made up of a FLO1 variant derived from S. cerevisiae S288c and additional repeats from FLONF from S. cerevisiae CCUG 53310 would be more stable and easier to amplify by PCR. The constructed gene, FLOw, had 22 internal repeats compared to 18 in FLO1. Expression of FLOw in otherwise non-flocculating strains led to strong flocculation. Despite the length of the gene, the cassette containing FLOw could be easily amplified and transformed into yeast strains of different genetic background, leading to strong flocculation in all cases tested. The developed gene can be used as a self-immobilization technique or to obtain rapidly sedimenting cells for application in e.g. sequential batches without need for centrifugation.",

Single chromosomal copies of the 4-HB 3-monooxygenase genes pobA and praI, from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and Paenibacillus sp.

With pobA, duplication of the genes for PCA metabolism allowed growth on 4-HB. However, with praI, growth required a mutation in the 4-HB/PCA transporter pcaK that increased intracellular concentrations of 4-HB, suggesting that flux through PraI was limiting.

Recently, P. putida has been engineered to valorize the lignin stream of a lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment process. Nonetheless, when compared to platform organisms such as Escherichia coli, the toolkit for engineering P. putida is underdeveloped. Heterologous gene expression in particular is problematic. Plasmid instability and copy number variance provide challenges for replicative plasmids, while use of homologous recombination for insertion of DNA into the chromosome is slow and laborious. Further, most heterologous expression efforts to date typically rely on overexpression of exogenous pathways using a handful of poorly characterized promoters. To improve the P. putida toolkit, we developed a rapid genome integration system using the site-specific recombinase from bacteriophage Bxb1 to enable rapid, high efficiency integration of DNA into the P. putida chromosome. We also developed a library of synthetic promoters with various UP elements, −35 sequences, and −10 sequences, as well as different ribosomal binding sites. We tested these promoters using a fluorescent reporter gene, mNeonGreen, to characterize the strength of each promoter, and identified UP-element-promoter-ribosomal binding sites combinations capable of driving a ~150-fold range of protein expression levels. An additional integrating vector was developed that confers more robust kanamycin resistance when integrated at single copy into the chromosome. This genome integration and reporter systems are extensible for testing other genetic parts, such as examining terminator strength, and will allow rapid integration of heterologous pathways for metabolic engineering.",

     "abstract": "Aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO) is a unique enzyme found exclusively in photosynthetic cyanobacteria, which natively converts acyl aldehyde precursors into hydrocarbon products embedded in cellular lipid bilayers. This capacity has opened doors for potential biotechnological applications aiming at biological production of diesel-range alkanes and alkenes, which are compatible with the nonrenewable petroleum-derived end-products in current use. The development of production platforms, however, has been limited by the relative inefficiency of ADO enzyme, promoting research towards finding new strategies and information to be used for rational design of enhanced pathways for hydrocarbon over-expression. In this work we present an optimized approach to study different ADO orthologs derived from different cyanobacterial species in an in vivo set-up in Escherichia coli. The system enabled comparison of alternative ADOs for the production efficiency of short-chain volatile C3-C7 alkanes, propane, pentane and heptane, and provided insight on the differences in substrate preference, catalytic efficiency and limitations associated with the enzymes. The work concentrated on five ADO orthologs which represent the most extensively studied cyanobacterial species in the field, and revealed distinct differences between the enzymes. In most cases the ADO from Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 performed the best in respect to yields and initial rates for the production of the volatile hydrocarbons. At the other extreme, the system harboring the ADO form Synechococcus sp. RS9917 produced very low amounts of the short-chain alkanes, primarily due to poor accumulation of the enzyme in E. coli. The ADOs from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Prochlorococcus marinus MIT9313, and the corresponding variant A134F displayed less divergence, although variation between chain-length preferences could be observed. The results confirmed the general trend of ADOs having decreasing catalytic efficiency towards precursors of decreasing chain-length, while expanding the knowledge on the species-specific traits, which may aid future pathway design and structure-based engineering of ADO for more efficient hydrocarbon production systems.",

     "abstract": "Carbon catabolite repression refers to the preference of microbes to metabolize certain growth substrates over others in response to a variety of regulatory mechanisms. Such preferences are important for the fitness of organisms in their natural environments, but may hinder their performance as domesticated microbial cell factories. In a Pseudomonas putida KT2440 strain engineered to convert lignin-derived aromatic monomers such as p-coumarate and ferulate to muconate, a precursor to bio-based nylon and other chemicals, metabolic intermediates including 4-hydroxybenzoate and vanillate accumulate and subsequently reduce productivity. We hypothesized that these metabolic bottlenecks may be, at least in part, the effect of carbon catabolite repression caused by glucose or acetate, more preferred substrates that must be provided to the strain for supplementary energy and cell growth. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we have identified the 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, PobA, and the vanillate demethylase, VanAB, as targets of the Catabolite Repression Control (Crc) protein, a global regulator of carbon catabolite repression. By deleting the gene encoding Crc from this strain, the accumulation of 4-hydroxybenzoate and vanillate are reduced and, as a result, muconate production is enhanced. In cultures grown on glucose, the yield of muconate produced from p-coumarate after 36 h was increased nearly 70% with deletion of the gene encoding Crc (94.6 ± 0.6% vs. 56.0 ± 3.0% (mol/mol)) while the yield from ferulate after 72 h was more than doubled (28.3 ± 3.3% vs. 12.0 ± 2.3% (mol/mol)). The effect of eliminating Crc was similar in cultures grown on acetate, with the yield from p-coumarate just slightly higher in the Crc deletion strain after 24 h (47.7 ± 0.6% vs. 40.7 ± 3.6% (mol/mol)) and the yield from ferulate increased more than 60% after 72 h (16.9 ± 1.4% vs. 10.3 ± 0.1% (mol/mol)).

Given the large contribution of sugar and lignocellulosic feedstocks to biorefinery operating costs, natural gas and other C1 sources may provide an economic advantage. To assess the relative costs of these feedstocks, we performed flux balance analysis on genome-scale metabolic models to calculate the maximum theoretical yields of chemical products from methane, methanol, acetate, and glucose. Yield calculations were performed for every metabolite (as a proxy for desired products) in the genome-scale metabolic models of three organisms: Escherichia coli (bacterium), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (cyanobacterium). The calculated theoretical yields and current feedstock prices provided inputs to create comparative feedstock cost surfaces. Our analysis shows that, at current market prices, methane feedstock costs are consistently lower than glucose when used as a carbon and energy source for microbial chemical production. Conversely, methanol is costlier than glucose under almost all price scenarios. Acetate feedstock costs could be less than glucose given efficient acetate production from low-cost syngas using nascent biological gas to liquids (BIO-GTL) technologies. Our analysis suggests that research should focus on overcoming the technical challenges of methane assimilation and/or yield of acetate via BIO-GTL to take advantage of low-cost natural gas rather than using methanol as a feedstock.",

The compartmentation of eukaryotic cells adds to model complexity. Model constraints are ideally based on biochemical evidence, which is rarely available for non-conventional yeast and eukaryotic cells. A small-scale model for 13C-based metabolic flux analysis of central yeast carbon metabolism was developed that is universally valid and does not depend on localization information regarding amino acid anabolism. The variable compartmental origin of traced metabolites is a feature that allows application of the model to yeasts with uncertain genomic and transcriptional backgrounds. The presented test case includes the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha. Highly similar flux solutions were computed using either a model with undefined pathway localization or a model with constraints based on curated (S. cerevisiae) or computationally predicted (H. polymorpha) localization information, while false solutions were found with incorrect localization constraints. These results indicate a potentially adverse effect of universally assuming Saccharomyces-like constraints on amino acid biosynthesis for non-conventional yeasts and verify the validity of neglecting compartmentation constraints using a small-scale metabolic model.

     "abstract": "Corynebacterium glutamicum shows yellow pigmentation due to biosynthesis of the C50 carotenoid decaprenoxanthin and its glycosides. This bacterium has been engineered for production of various non-native cyclic C40 and C50 carotenoids such as β-carotene, astaxanthin or sarcinaxanthin. In this study, the effect of modulating gene expression more broadly by overexpression of sigma factor genes on carotenoid production by C. glutamicum was characterized. Overexpression of the primary sigma factor gene sigA improved lycopene production by recombinant C. glutamicum up to 8-fold. In C. glutamicum wild type, overexpression of sigA led to 2-fold increased accumulation of the native carotenoid decaprenoxanthin in the stationary growth phase. Under these conditions, genes related to thiamine synthesis and aromatic compound degradation showed increased RNA levels and addition of thiamine and the aromatic iron chelator protocatechuic acid to the culture medium enhanced carotenoid production when sigA was overexpressed. Deletion of the gene for the alternative sigma factor SigB, which is expected to replace SigA in RNA polymerase holoenzymes during transition to the stationary growth phase, also increased carotenoid production. The strategy of sigA overexpression could be successfully transferred to production of the non-native carotenoids β-carotene and bisanhydrobacterioruberin (BABR). Production of the latter is the first demonstration that C. glutamicum may accumulate a non-native linear C50 carotenoid instead of the native cyclic C50 carotenoid decaprenoxanthin.",

     "abstract": "Ustilago trichophora RK089 has been found recently as a good natural malic acid producer from glycerol. This strain has previously undergone adaptive laboratory evolution for enhanced substrate uptake rate resulting in the strain U. trichophora TZ1. Medium optimization and investigation of process parameters enabled titers and rates that are able to compete with those of organisms overexpressing major parts of the underlying metabolic pathways. Metabolic engineering can likely further increase the efficiency of malate production by this organism, provided that basic genetic tools and methods can be established for this rarely used and relatively obscure species.Here we investigate and adapt existing molecular tools from U. maydis for use in U. trichophora. Selection markers from U. maydis that confer carboxin, hygromycin, nourseothricin, and phleomycin resistance are applicable in U. trichophora. A plasmid was constructed containing the ip-locus of U. trichophora RK089, resulting in site-specific integration into the genome. Using this plasmid, overexpression of pyruvate carboxylase, two malate dehydrogenases (mdh1, mdh2), and two malate transporters (ssu1, ssu2) was possible in U. trichophora TZ1 under control of the strong Petef promoter. Overexpression of mdh1, mdh2, ssu1, and ssu2 increased the product (malate) to substrate (glycerol) yield by up to 54% in shake flasks reaching a titer of up to 120 g L−1. In bioreactor cultivations of U. trichophora TZ1 Petefssu2 and U. trichophora TZ1 Petefmdh2 a drastically lowered biomass formation and glycerol uptake rate resulted in 29% (Ssu1) and 38% (Mdh2) higher specific production rates and 38% (Ssu1) and 46% (Mdh2) increased yields compared to the reference strain U. trichophora TZ1. Investigation of the product spectrum resulted in an 87% closed carbon balance with 134 g L−1 malate and biomass (73 g L−1), succinate (20 g L−1), CO2 (17 g L−1), and α-ketoglutarate (8 g L−1) as main by-products.These results open up a wide range of possibilities for further optimization, especially combinatorial metabolic engineering to increase the flux from pyruvate to malic acid and to reduce by-product formation.",

     "abstract": "The sugar dehydration products, furfural and 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF), are commonly formed during high-temperature processing of lignocellulose, most often in thermochemical pretreatment, liquefaction, or pyrolysis. Typically, these two aldehydes are considered major inhibitors in microbial conversion processes. Many microbes can convert these compounds to their less toxic, dead-end alcohol counterparts, furfuryl alcohol and 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfuryl alcohol. Recently, the genes responsible for aerobic catabolism of furfural and HMF were discovered in Cupriavidus basilensis HMF14 to enable complete conversion of these compounds to the TCA cycle intermediate, 2-oxo-glutarate. In this work, we engineer the robust soil microbe, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, to utilize furfural and HMF as sole carbon and energy sources via complete genomic integration of the 12 kB hmf gene cluster previously reported from Burkholderia phytofirmans. The common intermediate, 2-furoic acid, is shown to be a bottleneck for both furfural and HMF metabolism. When cultured on biomass hydrolysate containing representative amounts of furfural and HMF from dilute-acid pretreatment, the engineered strain outperforms the wild type microbe in terms of reduced lag time and enhanced growth rates due to catabolism of furfural and HMF. Overall, this study demonstrates that an approach for biological conversion of furfural and HMF, relative to the typical production of dead-end alcohols, enables both enhanced carbon conversion and substantially improves tolerance to hydrolysate inhibitors. This approach should find general utility both in emerging aerobic processes for the production of fuels and chemicals from biomass-derived sugars and in the biological conversion of high-temperature biomass streams from liquefaction or pyrolysis where furfural and HMF are much more abundant than in biomass hydrolysates from pretreatment.",

This makes RuBisCO one of the bottlenecks for oxygenic photosynthesis and carbon fixation. In this study, RuBisCO was overexpressed in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803. Relative RuBisCO levels in the engineered strains FL50 and FL52 increased 2.1 times and 1.4 times, respectively, and both strains showed increased growth, photosynthesis and in vitro RuBisCO activity. The oxygen evolution rate increased by 54% and 42% on per chlorophyll basis, while the in vitro RuBisCO activity increased by 52% and 8.6%, respectively. The overexpressed RuBisCO were tagged with a FLAG tag, in strain FL50 on the N terminus of the large subunit while in strain FL52 on the C terminus of the small subunit. The presence of a FLAG tag enhanced transcription of the genes encoding RuBisCO, and, with high possibility, also enhanced the initiation of translation or stability of the enzyme. However, when using a streptavidin-binding tag II (strep-tag II), we did not observe a similar effect. Tagged RuBisCO offers an opportunity for further studying RuBisCO expression and stability. Increased levels of RuBisCO can further improve photosynthesis and growth in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 under certain growth conditions.",

We applied SelFi to construct selection pathways for four enzymes and their desired enzymatic products xylitol, D-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, methanol, and aniline. Two of the selection pathways identified by SelFi were previously experimentally validated for engineering Xylose Reductase and RuBisCO.

Isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) is an important catalytic enzyme that is localized at the cytosol and mitochondria; the metabolic pathway catalyzed by ICDH differs between the OMM and IMM. To estimate the possible role of lipid membrane in the enzymatic activity of NADP+-dependent ICDH, CL-modified liposomes were prepared using CL/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC)/cholesterol (Ch), and their characteristics were analyzed based on the fluorescent probe method. The relative enzymatic activity of ICDH decreased in the presence of CL/DPPC/Ch=(30/50/20) liposome, whereas activity increased in the presence of CL/DPPC/Ch=(5/75/20) liposome. NADP+ had the greatest substrate affinity and was dominant in the regulation of ICDH activity. Analysis of membrane properties indicated that membranes in CL-modified liposomes were dehydrated by ICDH binding. Using circular dichroism analysis, CL/DPPC/Ch=(30/50/20) liposome induced a conformational change in ICDH, indicating that CL-rich membrane domains could inhibit ICDH activity. These results suggest that lipid membranes, including CL molecules, could act as a platform to regulate ICDH-related metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle and lipid synthesis.",

In the present study, a three-fold increase was observed in the amount as well as molecular weight of HA produced by recombinant ldh-mutant L. lactis strains. The diversion from lactate production in the ldh-mutant strains resulted in excess ethanol and acetoin production and higher NAD+/NADH ratio in these cultures.

     "abstract": "Pyrolysis offers a straightforward approach for the deconstruction of plant cell wall polymers into bio-oil. Recently, there has been substantial interest in bio-oil fractionation and subsequent use of biological approaches to selectively upgrade some of the resulting fractions. A fraction of particular interest for biological upgrading consists of polysaccharide-derived substrates including sugars and sugar dehydration products such as levoglucosan and cellobiosan, which are two of the most abundant pyrolysis products of cellulose. Levoglucosan can be converted to glucose-6-phosphate through the use of a levoglucosan kinase (LGK), but to date, the mechanism for cellobiosan utilization has not been demonstrated. Here, we engineer the microbe Pseudomonas putida KT2440 to use levoglucosan as a sole carbon and energy source through LGK integration. Moreover, we demonstrate that cellobiosan can be enzymatically converted to levoglucosan and glucose with β-glucosidase enzymes from both Glycoside Hydrolase Family 1 and Family 3. β-glucosidases are commonly used in both natural and industrial cellulase cocktails to convert cellobiose to glucose to relieve cellulase product inhibition and to facilitate microbial uptake of glucose. Using an exogenous β-glucosidase, we demonstrate that the engineered strain of P. putida can grow on levoglucosan up to 60 g/L and can also utilize cellobiosan. Overall, this study elucidates the biological pathway to co-utilize levoglucosan and cellobiosan, which will be a key transformation for the biological upgrading of pyrolysis-derived substrates.",

     "abstract": "It is theoretically possible to engineer Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains in which isobutanol is the predominant catabolic product and high-yielding isobutanol-producing strains are already reported by industry. Conversely, isobutanol yields of engineered S. cerevisiae strains reported in the scientific literature typically remain far below 10% of the theoretical maximum. This study explores possible reasons for these suboptimal yields by a mass-balancing approach. A cytosolically located, cofactor-balanced isobutanol pathway, consisting of a mosaic of bacterial enzymes whose in vivo functionality was confirmed by complementation of null mutations in branched-chain amino acid metabolism, was expressed in S. cerevisiae. Product formation by the engineered strain was analysed in shake flasks and bioreactors. In aerobic cultures, the pathway intermediate isobutyraldehyde was oxidized to isobutyrate rather than reduced to isobutanol. Moreover, significant concentrations of the pathway intermediates 2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate and α-ketoisovalerate, as well as diacetyl and acetoin, accumulated extracellularly. While the engineered strain could not grow anaerobically, micro-aerobic cultivation resulted in isobutanol formation at a yield of 0.018±0.003 mol/mol glucose. Simultaneously, 2,3-butanediol was produced at a yield of 0.649±0.067 mol/mol glucose. These results identify massive accumulation of pathway intermediates, as well as overflow metabolites derived from acetolactate, as an important, previously underestimated contributor to the suboptimal yields of ‘academic’ isobutanol strains. The observed patterns of by-product formation is consistent with the notion that in vivo activity of the iron–sulphur-cluster-requiring enzyme dihydroxyacid dehydratase is a key bottleneck in the present and previously described ‘academic’ isobutanol-producing yeast strains.",

This described method is a Cell Exclusion Zone Assay, in which cell-free areas are created by growing cells around removable silicone stoppers. Upon appropriate staining with fluorescent dyes and microscopically visualizing the monolayers, the migration rate is then quantified by counting the cells (nuclei) intruding the void area left by the silicone insert. In the current study human small intestine epithelial cells were seeded on a physiological substrate matrix to produce collectively migrating monolayers. Different substrates were tested to determine the optimal surface for enterocyte adherence and migration and morphological changes monitored. Recombinant human epidermal growth factor and osteopontin purified from urine were tested to see if the established migration assay produces accurate and reliable migration data with human small intestine cells. The obtained data accurately confirmed that the two bioactive proteins modulate cellular migration in a dose-dependent manner. The presented assay can likely be converted for use with other adherent cell lines or substrate matrices and allows for high throughput, while cost is kept low and versatility high. Co-staining can be applied in order to assay for cell death, different cell types, cell stress and others allowing intricate analysis of migration rate of mixed populations and correction for cell viability.",

It typically grows at an external pH of 2 using the oxidation of ferrous ions by oxygen, producing ferric ions and water, while fixing carbon dioxide from the environment. A. ferrooxidans is of great interest for biomining and environmental applications, as it can process mineral ores and alleviate the negative environmental consequences derived from the mining processes. In this study, the first genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 was generated (iMC507). A total of 587 metabolic and transport/exchange reactions, 507 genes and 573 metabolites organized in over 42 subsystems were incorporated into the model. Based on a new genetic algorithm approach, that integrates flux balance analysis, chemiosmotic theory, and physiological data, the proton translocation stoichiometry for a number of enzymes and maintenance parameters under aerobic chemolithoautotrophic conditions using three different electron donors were estimated. Furthermore, a detailed electron transfer and carbon flux distributions during chemolithoautotrophic growth using ferrous ion, tetrathionate and thiosulfate were determined and reported. Finally, 134 growth-coupled designs were calculated that enables Extracellular Polysaccharide production. iMC507 serves as a knowledgebase for summarizing and categorizing the information currently available for A. ferrooxidans and enables the understanding and engineering of Acidithiobacillus and similar species from a comprehensive model-driven perspective for biomining applications.",

Although this aromatic pathway is one of the best-studied pathways in biochemistry, the complete pathway, including its regulation by aromatic carbon sources, has not been integrated into the metabolic network. In particular, information about the in vivo operation (e.g., kinetics and flux capacity) of the pathway is lacking. In this contribution, we use kinetic modeling and thermodynamic analysis to evaluate the in vivo operation of this key aromatic multi-step pathway. The resulting ab initio deterministic model of benzoate degradation via the β-ketoadipate (ortho-cleavage) pathway in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is presented. The kinetic model includes mechanistic rate expressions for the enzymes and transport processes. The design and experimental validation of the model are driven by data generated from short-term perturbation experiments in a benzoate-limited continuous culture. The results of rigorous modeling of the in vivo dynamics provide strong support for flux regulation by the benzoate transporter and the enzymes forming and cleaving catechol. Revisiting the β-ketoadipate pathway might be valuable for applications in different fields, such as biochemistry and metabolic engineering, that use lignin monomers as a carbon source.",

     "abstract": "The conversion of biomass-derived sugars and aromatic molecules to cis,cis-muconic acid (referred to hereafter as muconic acid or muconate) has been of recent interest owing to its facile conversion to adipic acid, an important commodity chemical. Metabolic routes to produce muconate from both sugars and many lignin-derived aromatic compounds require the use of a decarboxylase to convert protocatechuate (PCA, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate) to catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene), two central aromatic intermediates in this pathway. Several studies have identified the PCA decarboxylase as a metabolic bottleneck, causing an accumulation of PCA that subsequently reduces muconate production. A recent study showed that activity of the PCA decarboxylase is enhanced by co-expression of two genetically associated proteins, one of which likely produces a flavin-derived cofactor utilized by the decarboxylase. Using entirely genome-integrated gene expression, we have engineered Pseudomonas putida KT2440-derived strains to produce muconate from either aromatic molecules or sugars and demonstrate in both cases that co-expression of these decarboxylase associated proteins reduces PCA accumulation and enhances muconate production relative to strains expressing the PCA decarboxylase alone. In bioreactor experiments, co-expression increased the specific productivity (mg/g cells/h) of muconate from the aromatic lignin monomer p-coumarate by 50% and resulted in a titer of >15 g/L. In strains engineered to produce muconate from glucose, co-expression more than tripled the titer, yield, productivity, and specific productivity, with the best strain producing 4.92±0.48 g/L muconate. This study demonstrates that overcoming the PCA decarboxylase bottleneck can increase muconate yields from biomass-derived sugars and aromatic molecules in industrially relevant strains and cultivation conditions.",

The TCA cycle in cyanobacteria branches into oxidative and reductive routes. Time-course analyses of the metabolome, transcriptome and metabolic turnover described here revealed dynamic changes in the metabolism of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 cultivated under dark anoxic conditions, allowing identification of the carbon flow and rate-limiting steps in glycogen catabolism. Glycogen biosynthesized from CO2 assimilated during periods of light exposure is catabolized to succinate via glycolysis, the anaplerotic pathway, and the reductive TCA cycle under dark anoxic conditions. Expression of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase gene (ppc) was identified as a rate-limiting step in succinate biosynthesis and this rate limitation was alleviated by ppc overexpression, resulting in improved succinate excretion. The sugar-free succinate production was further enhanced by the addition of bicarbonate. In vivo labeling with NaH13CO3 clearly showed carbon incorporation into succinate via the anaplerotic pathway. Bicarbonate is in equilibrium with CO2. Succinate production by Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 therefore holds significant promise for CO2 capture and utilization.",

In this study, useful compositions of 13C-labeled glucose for 13C-metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) of Escherichia coli are investigated using a computer simulation of the stable isotope labeling experiment. Following the generation of artificial mass spectra datasets of amino acid fragments using five literature-reported flux distributions of E. coli, the best fitted flux distribution and the 95% confidence interval were estimated by the 13C-MFA procedure. A comparison of the precision scores showed that [1, 2-13C]glucose and a mixture of [1-13C] and [U-13C]glucose at 8:2 are one of the best carbon sources for a precise estimation of flux levels of the pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Although the precision scores of the anaplerotic and glyoxylate pathway reactions were affected by both the carbon source and flux distribution, it was also shown that the mixture of non-labeled, [1-13C], and [U-13C]glucose at 4:1:5 was specifically effective for the flux estimation of the glyoxylate pathway reaction.

In the past, this has not caused concerns because the metabolic networks studied were invariably associated with living cells. Nowadays, there are needs to reconstruct metabolic networks, and so metabolic homeostasis cannot be taken for granted. For metabolic steady state, enzyme feedback control has been known to explain why metabolites in metabolic pathways can avoid accumulation. However, we reasoned that there are further contributing mechanisms. As a new methodology developed, we separated cofactor intermediates (CIs) from non-cofactor intermediates, and identified an appropriate type of open systems for operating putative reaction topologies. Furthermore, we elaborated the criteria to tell if a multi-enzyme over-all reaction path is of in vivo nature or not at the metabolic level. As new findings, we discovered that there are interactions between the enzyme feedback inhibition and the CI turnover, and such interactions may well lead to metabolic homeostasis, an emergent property of the system. To conclude, this work offers a new perspective for understanding the role of CIs and the presence of metabolic homeostasis in the living cell. In perspective, this work might provide clues for constructing non-natural metabolic networks using multi-enzyme reactions or by degenerating metabolic reaction networks from the living cell.",

Here we describe a method to reduce the overall oxidative stress by overexpressing the endogenous HAP1 gene in a S. cerevisiae strain overproducing recombinant α-amylase. We demonstrate how Hap1p can activate a set of oxidative stress response genes and meanwhile contribute to increase the metabolic rate of the yeast strains, therefore mitigating the negative effect of the ROS accumulation associated to protein folding and hence increasing the production capacity during batch fermentations.",

     "abstract": "Metabolic engineering of microbial cell factories for the production of heterologous secondary metabolites implicitly relies on the intensification of intracellular flux directed toward the product of choice. Apart from reactions following peripheral pathways, enzymes of the central carbon metabolism are usually targeted for the enhancement of precursor supply. In Pseudomonas putida, a Gram-negative soil bacterium, central carbon metabolism, i.e., the reactions required for the synthesis of all 12 biomass precursors, was shown to be regulated at the metabolic level and not at the transcriptional level. The bacterium's central carbon metabolism appears to be driven by demand to react rapidly to ever-changing environmental conditions. In contrast, peripheral pathways that are only required for growth under certain conditions are regulated transcriptionally. In this work, we show that this regulation regime can be exploited for metabolic engineering.We tested this driven-by-demand metabolic engineering strategy using rhamnolipid production as an example. Rhamnolipid synthesis relies on two pathways, i.e., fatty acid de novo synthesis and the rhamnose pathway, providing the required precursors hydroxyalkanoyloxy-alkanoic acid (HAA) and activated (dTDP-)rhamnose, respectively. In contrast to single-pathway molecules, rhamnolipid synthesis causes demand for two central carbon metabolism intermediates, i.e., acetyl-CoA for HAA and glucose-6-phosphate for rhamnose synthesis.Following the above-outlined strategy of driven by demand, a synthetic promoter library was developed to identify the optimal expression of the two essential genes (rhlAB) for rhamnolipid synthesis. The best rhamnolipid-synthesizing strain had a yield of 40% rhamnolipids on sugar [CmolRL/CmolGlc], which is approximately 55% of the theoretical yield. The rate of rhamnolipid synthesis of this strain was also high. Compared to an exponentially growing wild type, the rhamnose pathway increased its flux by 300%, whereas the flux through de novo fatty acid synthesis increased by 50%.We show that the central carbon metabolism of P. putida is capable of meeting the metabolic demand generated by engineering transcription in peripheral pathways, thereby enabling a significant rerouting of carbon flux toward the product of interest, in this case, rhamnolipids of industrial interest.",

While these carboxylates have low values and are inhibitory to microbes during fermentation, they can be biologically upgraded to high-value products. In this study, we expanded our general framework for biological upgrading of carboxylates to branched-chain esters by using three highly active alcohol acyltransferases (AATs) for alcohol and acyl CoA condensation and modulating the alcohol moiety from ethanol to isobutanol in the modular chassis cell. With this framework, we demonstrated the production of an ester library comprised of 16 out of all 18 potential esters, including acetate, propionate, butanoate, pentanoate, and hexanoate esters, from the 5 linear, saturated C2-C6 carboxylic acids. Among these esters, 5 new branched-chain esters, including isobutyl acetate, isobutyl propionate, isobutyl butyrate, isobutyl pentanoate, and isobutyl hexanoate were synthesized in vivo.

     "abstract": "Glycerol is an abundant by-product during biodiesel production and additionally has several assets compared to sugars when used as a carbon source for growing microorganisms in the context of biotechnological applications. However, most strains of the platform production organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae grow poorly in synthetic glycerol medium. It has been hypothesized that the uptake of glycerol could be a major bottleneck for the utilization of glycerol in S. cerevisiae. This species exclusively relies on an active transport system for glycerol uptake. This work demonstrates that the expression of predicted glycerol facilitators (Fps1 homologues) from superior glycerol-utilizing yeast species such as Pachysolen tannophilus, Komagataella pastoris, Yarrowia lipolytica and Cyberlindnera jadinii significantly improves the growth performance on glycerol of the previously selected glycerol-consuming S. cerevisiae wild-type strain (CBS 6412-13A). The maximum specific growth rate increased from 0.13 up to 0.18 h−1 and a biomass yield coefficient of 0.56 gDW/gglycerol was observed. These results pave the way for exploiting the assets of glycerol in the production of fuels, chemicals and pharmaceuticals based on baker's yeast.",

     "abstract": "The development of sustainable, bio-based technologies to convert solar energy and carbon dioxide into fuels is a grand challenge. A core part of this challenge is to produce a fuel that is compatible with the existing transportation infrastructure. This task is further compounded by the commercial desire to separate the fuel from the biotechnological host. Based on its fuel characteristics, 1-octanol was identified as an attractive metabolic target with diesel-like properties. We therefore engineered a synthetic pathway specifically for the biosynthesis of 1-octanol in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) by over-expression of three enzymes (thioesterase, carboxylic acid reductase and aldehyde reductase) and one maturation factor (phosphopantetheinyl transferase). Induction of this pathway in a shake flask resulted in 4.4 mg 1-octanol L−1 h−1 which exceeded the productivity of previously engineered strains. Furthermore, the majority (73%) of the fatty alcohol was localised within the media without the addition of detergent or solvent overlay. The deletion of acrA reduced the production and excretion of 1-octanol by 3-fold relative to the wild-type, suggesting that the AcrAB–TolC complex may be responsible for the majority of product efflux. This study presents 1-octanol as a potential fuel target that can be synthesised and naturally accumulated within the media using engineered microbes.",

To address these issues, a metabolism-based plasmid addiction system, which relies on lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and maintenance of cellular redox balance for 1-butanol production; and utilizes an active constitutive promoter, was developed in Escherichia coli. Expression of the plasmid is absolutely required for cell viability and 1-butanol production. This system abrogates the need for expensive antibiotics and co-inducer molecules so that plasmid-borne synthetic genes may be expressed at high levels in a cost-effective manner. To illustrate these principles, high level and sustained production of 1-butanol by E. coli was demonstrated under different growth conditions and in semi-continuous batch cultures, in the absence of antibiotics and co-inducer molecules.",

The de novo biosynthesis of benzyl alcohol directly from renewable glucose was herein explored using a non-natural pathway engineered in Escherichia coli. Benzaldehyde was first produced from endogenous phenylpyruvate via three heterologous steps, including hydroxymandelate synthase (encoded by hmaS) from Amycolatopsis orientalis, followed by (S)-mandelate dehydrogenase (encoded by mdlB) and phenylglyoxylate decarboxylase (encoded by mdlC) from Pseudomonas putida ATCC 12633. The subsequent rapid and efficient reduction of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol occurred by the combined activity and native regulation of multiple endogenous alcohol dehydrogenases and/or aldo-keto reductases. Through systematic deletion of competing aromatic amino acid biosynthesis pathways to promote endogenous phenylpyruvate availability, final benzyl alcohol titers as high as 114±1 mg/L were realized, representing a yield of 7.6±0.1 mg/g on glucose and a ~5-fold improvement over initial strains.",

This review summarizes the recent progress in metabolic engineering of yeast cells for fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives production, including the regulation of acetyl-CoA biosynthesis, NADPH production, fatty acid elongation, and the accumulation of activated precursors of fatty acids for converting enzymes.

     "abstract": "The effect of pyruvate kinase gene (pyk) deletion on the physiology of Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC13032 was investigated under biotin-sufficient, non-glutamate-producing conditions. In a complex medium containing 100 g/L glucose, a defined pyk deletion mutant, strain D1, exhibited 35% enhancement in glucose consumption rate, 37% increased growth and a 57% reduction in respiration rate compared to the wild-type parent. Significant upregulation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase and downregulation of PEP carboxykinase activities were observed in the D1 mutant, which may have prevented over-accumulation of PEP caused by the pyk deletion. Moreover, we found a dramatic 63% reduction in the activity of malate:quinone oxidoreductase (MQO) in the D1 mutant. MQO, a TCA cycle enzyme that converts malate to oxaloacetate (OAA), constitutes a major primary gate to the respiratory chain in C. glutamicum, thus explaining the reduced respiration rate in the mutant. Additionally, pyruvate carboxylase gene expression was downregulated in the mutant. These changes seemed to prevent OAA over-accumulation caused by the activity changes of PEP carboxylase/PEP carboxykinase. Intrinsically the same alterations were observed in the cultures conducted in a minimal medium containing 20 g/L glucose. Despite these responses in the mutant, metabolic distortion caused by pyk deletion under non-glutamate-producing conditions required amelioration by increased biomass production, as metabolome analysis revealed increased intracellular concentrations of several precursor metabolites for building block formation associated with pyk deletion. These fermentation profiles and metabolic alterations observed in the mutant reverted completely to the wild-type phenotypes in the pyk-complemented strain, suggesting the observed metabolic changes were caused by the pyk deletion. These results demonstrated multilateral strategies to overcome metabolic disturbance caused by pyk deletion in this bacterium.",

     "abstract": "Macroalgae have high potential to be an efficient, and sustainable feedstock for the production of biofuels and other more valuable chemicals. Attempts have been made to enable the co-fermentation of alginate and mannitol by Saccharomyces cerevisiae to unlock the full potential of this marine biomass. However, the efficient use of the sugars derived from macroalgae depends on the equilibrium of cofactors derived from the alginate and mannitol catabolic pathways. There are a number of strong metabolic limitations that have to be tackled before this bioconversion can be carried out efficiently by engineered yeast cells.An analysis of the redox balance during ethanol fermentation from alginate and mannitol by Saccharomyces cerevisiae using metabolic engineering tools was carried out. To represent the strain designed for conversion of macroalgae carbohydrates to ethanol, a context-specific model was derived from the available yeast genome-scale metabolic reconstructions. Flux balance analysis and dynamic simulations were used to determine the flux distributions. The model indicates that ethanol production is determined by the activity of 4-deoxy-l-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronate (DEHU) reductase (DehR) and its preferences for NADH or NADPH which influences strongly the flow of cellular resources. Different scenarios were explored to determine the equilibrium between NAD(H) and NADP(H) that will lead to increased ethanol yields on mannitol and DEHU under anaerobic conditions. When rates of mannitol dehydrogenase and DehRNADH tend to be close to a ratio in the range 1–1.6, high growth rates and ethanol yields were predicted. The analysis shows a number of metabolic limitations that are not easily identified through experimental procedures such as quantifying the impact of the cofactor preference by DEHU reductase in the system, the low flux into the alginate catabolic pathway, and a detailed analysis of the redox balance. These results show that production of ethanol and other chemicals can be optimized if a redox balance is achieved. A possible methodology to achieve this balance is presented. This paper shows how metabolic engineering tools are essential to comprehend and overcome this limitation.",

These predictions were confirmed experimentally, and exhibited quantitative agreement with measured O2 and NO● concentrations, and durations of respiratory inhibition. These results provide important information on key design parameters in the formulation of NO●-based therapeutics, and highlight the utility of a model-based approach for the analysis of dosing regimens.",

     "abstract": "There is currently a strong interest to derive the biological precursor cis,cis-muconic acid from shikimate pathway-branches to develop a biological replacement for adipic acid. Pioneered by the Frost laboratory this concept has regained interest: Recent approaches (Boles, Alper, Yan) however suffer from low product titres. Here an in silico comparison of all strain construction strategies was conducted to highlight stoichiometric optimizations. Using elementary mode analysis new knock-out strategies were determined in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. The strain construction strategies are unique to each pathway-branch and organism, allowing significantly different maximum and minimum yields. The maximum theoretical product carbon yields on glucose ranged from 86% (dehydroshikimate-branch) to 69% (anthranilate-branch). In most cases a coupling of product formation to growth was possible. Especially in S. cerevisiae chorismate-routes a minimum yield constraint of 46.9% could be reached. The knock-out targets are non-obvious, and not-transferable, highlighting the importance of tailored strain construction strategies.",
